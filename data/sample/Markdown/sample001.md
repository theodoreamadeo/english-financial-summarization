# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue experienced dramatic growth from 2022-2024, increasing 126% from 2022-2024, with the most significant jump occurring in 2024 (126% increase from 2023). This growth was primarily driven by the Compute & Networking segment, which became the dominant revenue driver, growing from $11,046M in 2022 to $47,405M in 2024. Graphics revenue declined from $15,868M in 2022 to $11,906M in 2023 but recovered to $13,517M in 2024.Geographically, the US became the largest market, growing from $4,349M in 2022 to $26,966M in 2024. Gross margin improved significantly to 72.72% in 2024 from 56.92% in 2023, though it remained below the 2022 level of 64.95%. The margin improvement in 2024 reflects better cost management and product mix optimization despite higher absolute costs. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating efficiency showed remarkable improvement, with operating margin reaching 54.13% in 2024, a substantial increase from 15.66% in 2023, and higher than 37.32% achieved in 2022. The 2023 decline to 15.66% represented a significant efficiency challenge, but the company demonstrated strong operational leverage in 2024. Operating income surged from $4,224M in 2023 to $32,972M in 2024, while operating expenses increased modestly from $11,132M to $11,329M, indicating excellent cost control and scalability of the business model during the revenue expansion. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate showed significant variation across the period, moving from 1.90% in 2022 to -4.47% in 2023 (indicating a tax benefit), and then to 12.00% in 2024. The negative tax rate in 2023 provided a one-time benefit to profitability, with the company receiving a tax benefit of $187M despite having pre-tax income of $4,181M. In 2024, the normalization of the tax rate to 12.00% represented a more typical tax burden, with tax expense of $4,058M on pre-tax income of $33,818M. This tax normalization had a moderating effect on net profit growth compared to the exceptional 2023 tax benefit. |
