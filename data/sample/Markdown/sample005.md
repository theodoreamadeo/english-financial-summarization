# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue showed moderate growth with total revenue increasing from SGD 17,774.8M in 2023 to SGD 19,012.7M in 2024 (7.0% growth) and SGD 19,539.8M in 2025 (2.8% growth). By product segments, Full-Service Carrier (FSC) remained the dominant revenue driver, growing consistently from SGD 15,590.1M in 2023 to SGD 16,738.0M in 2025\. However, Low-Cost Carrier (LCC) segment declined in 2025 to SGD 2,349.2M from SGD 2,445.5M in 2024\. Engineering Services showed strong growth from SGD 796.0M in 2023 to SGD 1,245.1M in 2025\. Geographically, East Asia remained the largest market at SGD 9,917.8M in 2025, while Europe remained stable and South West Pacific declined slightly in 2025\. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating efficiency deteriorated significantly over the three-year period. Operating margin declined from 15.15% in 2023 to 14.35% in 2024 and dramatically to 8.75% in 2025\. Despite revenue growth, operating income fell sharply from SGD 2,727.5M in 2024 to SGD 1,709.1M in 2025, representing a 37.3% decline. This indicates substantial increases in operating expenses that outpaced revenue growth, severely impacting operational profitability in 2025\. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate showed a favorable declining trend, decreasing from 17.96% in 2023 to 11.26% in 2024 and further to 5.15% in 2025\. This significant reduction in tax burden positively contributed to net profitability, with tax expenses declining from SGD 473.5M in 2023 to SGD 152.6M in 2025 despite higher pre-tax income levels. This tax efficiency helped offset some of the negative impact from declining operating performance. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |

Current ratio was healthy at 123.44%, and the company maintained reasonable liquidity positions with current assets of SGD 15,641.7M. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability showed resilience despite operational challenges. Net profit increased from SGD 2,674.8M to SGD 2,778.0M, with net profit margin improving slightly from 14.07% to 14.17%. However, operating margin collapsed from 14.35% to 8.75%, indicating significant operational inefficiencies. The effective tax rate decreased favorably from 11.26% to 5.15%, contributing positively to bottom-line performance despite weaker operating results. | Profitability demonstrated strong performance with net profit growing from SGD 2,156.8M to SGD 2,674.8M and net profit margin improving from 12.13% to 14.07%. Operating margin remained strong at 14.35% compared to 15.15% in 2023, showing relatively stable operational performance. Effective tax rate decreased from 17.96% to 11.26%, contributing to improved profitability. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency deteriorated significantly with operating income declining from SGD 2,727.5M to SGD 1,709.1M despite revenue growth from SGD 19,012.7M to SGD 19,539.8M. Asset turnover remained relatively stable at 44.74% compared to 40.73%. The Full-Service Carrier segment continued to dominate revenue at SGD 16,738.0M, while Engineering Services showed strong growth from SGD 1,094.2M to SGD 1,245.1M. However, the Low-Cost Carrier segment declined from SGD 2,445.5M to SGD 2,349.2M. | Operational efficiency showed stable performance with operating income growing modestly from SGD 2,692.1M to SGD 2,727.5M alongside revenue growth from SGD 17,774.8M to SGD 19,012.7M.

| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risks have escalated with deteriorating liquidity position as current ratio dropped to 81.66% and quick ratio to 78.40%. Debt-to-equity ratio increased to 168.12%, indicating higher leverage. Interest coverage weakened to 466.84% from 690.86%, though still adequate. Dividend payout ratio increased to 51.43%, raising concerns about cash retention. Negative financing cash flows of SGD \-4,326.5M and declining operating cash flows signal potential cash flow stress. | Financial risks were moderate with current ratio at a healthy 123.44% and quick ratio at 120.11%. Debt-to-equity ratio was manageable at 164.35%. Interest coverage was strong at 690.86%, providing adequate protection for debt service. Dividend payout ratio increased to 42.25% from 13.78%, indicating higher cash distribution. Operating cash flows were robust at SGD 5,042.1M, though declining from previous year. |
| Future financial performance projection | Future performance faces significant challenges with deteriorating operational efficiency and declining operating margins signaling potential earnings pressure. The sharp drop in operating income despite revenue growth suggests unsustainable cost inflation. Weakening liquidity ratios and increasing leverage pose financial stability risks. However, strong market position in Full-Service Carrier operations and growing Engineering Services provide potential upside. Tax efficiency improvements may continue supporting net profitability short-term, but operational fixes are critical for sustainable performance. | Future performance outlook appeared positive with consistent revenue growth trajectory and stable operating margins. Strong cash generation capabilities and improving profitability metrics suggested sustainable growth potential. Expanding Engineering Services and growing Low-Cost Carrier segments indicated successful diversification. Healthy liquidity positions and manageable debt levels provided financial flexibility for strategic investments and growth initiatives. |
