# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | The company's profitability was significantly influenced by both revenue growth and margin expansion.   Comparing 2023 to 2022, revenue grew modestly by 3.7% (from RM4,409M to RM4,572M). However, Gross Margin improved dramatically from 17.3% to 25.8%. This margin improvement was the primary driver of higher gross profit and was largely due to a shift in business mix, notably the discontinuation of the lower-margin plantation business which had RM472.5M in revenue in 2022\.   Comparing 2024 to 2023, revenue surged by 29.4% to RM5,919M, driven by strong performance in the Construction, Property Development, and Port segments, primarily in Malaysia. The company successfully maintained its high Gross Margin at 26.2%, indicating effective cost control alongside rapid growth.   Overall, the divestment in 2022 led to a structurally higher gross margin in 2023 and 2024\. This, combined with strong, broad-based revenue growth in 2024, resulted in a substantial increase in gross profit over the period, from RM762M in 2022 to RM1,550M in 2024\. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating efficiency, measured by Operating Margin, improved consistently over the three years, contributing positively to profitability.   From 2022 to 2023, the Operating Margin increased from 12.2% to 16.2%. This improvement was primarily due to the significant expansion in gross margin, which more than compensated for an increase in operating expenses.   From 2023 to 2024, the Operating Margin saw a more substantial jump to 21.5%. This was driven by two key factors: continued strong revenue growth that outpaced the growth in operating expenses, and a significant positive swing from a large impairment charge in 2023 to a net reversal of impairment in 2024\.   Overall, the steady improvement in operating margin from 12.2% in 2022 to 21.5% in 2024 was a crucial factor in the company's growing profitability, reflecting better cost management at the gross level and the favorable impact of a non-recurring item reversal in the latest year. |
| External & One-Off Impact | External and one-off items created significant volatility in the company's net profit.   Comparing 2023 to 2022, the Effective Tax Rate spiked from 19.6% to an unusually high 56.2%. This, combined with a large non-recurring impairment charge of RM150M in 2023 (vs. a RM27M charge in 2022), were the primary reasons for the sharp decline in net profit from RM885M to RM212M, despite improved operating performance before these items.   Comparing 2024 to 2023, profitability was strongly boosted by the reversal of these negative impacts. The Effective Tax Rate normalized to 31.0%, and the previous year's impairment charge swung to a net reversal (gain) of RM76M. This positive swing of over RM226M from the impairment line, coupled with the lower tax rate on higher pre-tax profits, was a key driver of the net profit recovery to RM665M in 2024\.   Overall, while 2022's high net profit benefited from a low tax rate, 2023's profitability was severely depressed by a high tax rate and a significant impairment charge. The strong rebound in 2024's net profit was substantially aided by the normalization of the tax rate and a favorable reversal of impairments. |


## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective Column | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | The company demonstrated strong financial health in 2024, with significant revenue growth (up 29.4% to RM5,919M), robust gross and operating margins, and a healthy current ratio of 241.3%. Shareholders’ equity increased to RM10,217M, and net cash flow from operations remained strong at RM1,160M. The company maintained a manageable debt-to-equity ratio (97.85%) and improved its quick ratio to 105.0%, indicating solid liquidity and balance sheet strength. | In 2023, the company maintained stable financial health, with modest revenue growth (3.7%) and a high current ratio of 246.5%. Shareholders’ equity was RM9,844M, and net cash flow from operations was RM1,078M. The debt-to-equity ratio was stable at 97.0%, and the quick ratio was 95.9%, reflecting adequate liquidity. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability rebounded in 2024, with net profit rising to RM665M (net margin 11.25%), supported by sustained high gross margin (26.2%) and operating margin (21.5%). The return on equity improved to 6.61%. The normalization of the effective tax rate (31.0%) and a net reversal of impairments contributed to higher earnings quality. | In 2023, profitability was depressed, with net profit at RM212M (net margin 4.63%) due to a high effective tax rate (56.2%) and a large impairment charge (RM150M). Despite improved operating performance, these one-off items reduced earnings quality. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency improved in 2024, with operating margin rising to 21.5% and asset turnover increasing to 28.2%. The company managed to control costs while growing revenue, and interest coverage improved to 414.4%, reflecting strong ability to service debt. | In 2023, operating margin increased to 16.2% and asset turnover to 22.2%. Interest coverage was 289.9%. Efficiency gains were driven by higher gross margin and better cost management, despite higher operating expenses. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risks remain moderate. The debt-to-equity ratio is stable at 97.85%, and liquidity ratios are healthy. However, the dividend payout ratio (42.18%) is lower than previous years, indicating a more conservative approach. The company’s exposure to impairment and tax volatility in prior years highlights the need for ongoing risk monitoring. | The company faced elevated financial risk in 2023 due to a high effective tax rate and a large impairment charge, which significantly reduced net profit and payout ratio (132.61%). Liquidity and leverage remained stable, but earnings volatility was a concern. |
| Future financial performance projection | The company is well-positioned for continued growth, with a strong revenue base, high margins, and solid liquidity. The normalization of tax and impairment items in 2024 provides a stable foundation for future profitability. Continued focus on core segments and cost control should support further earnings growth, though vigilance is needed regarding external shocks and non-recurring items. | The outlook in 2023 was cautious due to earnings volatility from one-off items. However, underlying operational improvements and a strong balance sheet suggested potential for recovery, provided external risks were managed. |
