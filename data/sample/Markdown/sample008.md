# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Perspective | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics (Revenue Growth; Gross Margin; Revenue by Product/Service; Revenue by Geographic Region) | Revenue showed minimal growth from 2022 to 2023 (0.31% increase) but accelerated significantly in 2024 with 16.05% growth, reaching IDR 12.24 trillion. Gross margin consistently improved across all periods, rising from 25.29% in 2022 to 27.26% in 2023 and 28.56% in 2024, indicating better cost management and pricing power. Revenue composition remained stable with packaged food dominating at 87-89% of total sales, while beverages segment grew from 10.81% to 12.24% between 2023-2024. Geographic concentration remained heavily domestic-focused at approximately 97% of total revenue across all years, with export contributing only 3-4%. |
| Operating Efficiency (Operating Margin) | Operating efficiency showed mixed performance across the three-year period. Operating margin improved substantially from 6.78% in 2022 to 8.48% in 2023, reflecting better operational control and cost management. However, 2024 saw a decline to 7.48% despite strong revenue growth, suggesting that operating expenses grew faster than revenue. This indicates challenges in maintaining operational leverage during the rapid expansion phase, with operating expenses increasing significantly from IDR 1.98 trillion in 2023 to IDR 2.58 trillion in 2024\. |
| External & One-Off Impact (Effective Tax Rate, Non-Recurring Items) | The effective tax rate showed a favorable trend for the company, increasing from 22.63% in 2022 to 23.19% in 2023, then significantly dropping to 19.99% in 2024\. This 320 basis point reduction in 2024 contributed positively to net profitability, with income tax expense decreasing to IDR 171.68 billion despite higher pre-tax income. The lower tax rate in 2024 helped support net profit margin maintenance at 5.10% despite operational margin pressures. No specific information regarding non-recurring items was available in the provided financial data. |

| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency faced challenges in 2024 despite strong revenue growth of 16.05% from IDR 10.54 trillion in 2023 to IDR 12.24 trillion in 2024\. Operating expenses increased disproportionately from IDR 1.98 trillion to IDR 2.58 trillion, causing operating margin to decline from 8.48% to 7.48%.

Interest coverage strengthened substantially from 454.87% in 2022 to 538.77% in 2023, reflecting improved earnings relative to interest obligations. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Several risk factors emerged in 2024 including deteriorating liquidity with current ratio declining from 177.7% in 2023 to 137.0% in 2024, and quick ratio dropping from 105.9% to 81.3%. Current liabilities increased significantly from IDR 1.87 trillion to IDR 2.65 trillion, indicating higher short-term obligations. Debt-to-equity increased from 102.5% to 121.8%, suggesting rising leverage. Net cash flow turned negative at IDR \-199.9 billion compared to positive IDR 43.39 billion in 2023, primarily due to higher financing cash outflows of IDR 799.62 billion. | Risk profile improved in 2023 with debt-to-equity ratio decreasing from 139.6% in 2022 to 102.5%, indicating deleveraging efforts. Liquidity remained strong with current ratio improving from 174.1% to 177.7% and quick ratio increasing from 102.7% to 105.9%. However, interest expense increased from IDR 156.68 billion in 2022 to IDR 165.9 billion in 2023\.

| Future financial performance projection | Future performance outlook is mixed with positive revenue momentum from 16.05% growth in 2024 and improving gross margins reaching 28.56%, indicating strong market position and pricing power. The beverages segment showed growth from 10.81% to 12.24% of total revenue, suggesting diversification opportunities. However, operational efficiency challenges with declining operating margins and increased working capital requirements may pressure near-term profitability. The company's ability to maintain strong cash generation while managing higher current liabilities will be critical for sustained performance. | Future prospects appeared positive in 2023 with recovering profitability trends, net profit margin improvement from 4.05% to 5.50%, and strengthening operational efficiency with operating margins reaching 8.48%. The company demonstrated better cost control and deleveraging with improved debt-to-equity ratios. Strong cash flow generation of IDR 863.58 billion from operations provided a solid foundation for growth investments. However, modest revenue growth of 0.31% indicated market challenges that needed addressing for sustained performance improvement. |
