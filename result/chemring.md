| 3.1.1 | Profitability Analysis  - Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | 0.0000 | Incorrect | Revenue increased by 8% to £510.4m (2023: £472.6m), with a 9.5% increase at constant currency. This growth was driven by strong performance at Roke (up 17%) and niche Energetics businesses (up 12%), partially offset by a weaker year for Countermeasures. | Revenue grew from £442.8m in 2022 to £472.6m in 2023, and further to £510.4m in 2024. The gross margin is not available, but revenue growth is evident. Revenue by product/service shows growth in both segments, with Sensors & Information increasing significantly. Revenue by geographic region indicates growth in the UK and Europe, while the US saw a slight decline in 2024. | The submitted answer incorrectly states the revenue growth percentages and figures for the years 2022 and 2023. The ground truth specifies revenue figures for 2022, 2023, and 2024, which are not accurately reflected in the submitted answer. |
| 3.1.2 | Profitability Analysis  - Operating Efficiency | 0.0000 | Incorrect | Underlying operating profit margin decreased to 13.9% (2023: 14.6%), primarily due to operational challenges at the Tennessee countermeasures business and a lower-margin legacy US Government contract. | The operating margin decreased from 12.32% in 2022 to 9.61% in 2023, then increased to 11.38% in 2024. This indicates improved operating efficiency in 2024 compared to 2023, but not reaching 2022 levels. | The submitted answer incorrectly states the operating profit margin values and the years they correspond to. The ground truth indicates a decrease from 12.32% in 2022 to 9.61% in 2023, while the submitted answer mentions a decrease to 13.9% in 2023, which is not accurate. |
| 3.1.3 | Profitability Analysis  - External & One-Off Impact | 0.0000 | Incorrect | Non-underlying items impacting profit before tax were -£13.0m (2023: -£23.8m), including a £2.0m loss on derivative financial instruments, £3.4m acquisition expenses, £7.5m pension buy-in/buy-out costs, and £1.2m senior management change costs, offset by a £3.1m release of legal/disposal provisions. | The effective tax rate increased from 7.31% in 2022 to 14.51% in 2023, and further to 19.89% in 2024. This increase in tax rate coincided with a drop in net profit margin from 2022 to 2023, although other factors also influenced margins. | The submitted answer does not address the effective tax rate or net profit margin, which are key components of the ground truth. Instead, it focuses on non-underlying items impacting profit before tax, which is unrelated. |

Net debt increased to £52.8m (2023: £14.4m), indicating higher leverage. | The company demonstrates continued revenue growth, increasing to £510.4m from £472.6m in 2023. Total assets expanded to £692.1m. However, this growth was accompanied by a significant rise in total liabilities to £335.8m from £217.9m, which contributed to a decline in shareholders' equity to £356.3m from £378.5m, indicating increased leverage. | The submitted answer incorrectly states that the company demonstrated growth in total assets and liabilities but fails to mention the revenue growth, which is a key aspect of the ground truth. Additionally, the figures for revenue are missing entirely in the submitted answer. |
| 3.2.2 | Financial Performance Summary - Profitabilitiy and earnings quality | 0.0000 | Incorrect | Profitability improved significantly, with profit after tax increasing to £39.5m (2023: £5.4m). Underlying operating profit rose to £71.1m (2023: £69.2m), though the underlying operating margin slightly decreased to 13.9% (2023: 14.6%). Underlying diluted EPS was 19.3p (2023: 20.0p). | Profitability saw a strong recovery in 2024. The net profit margin surged to 7.74% from 1.14% in 2023, and the operating margin improved to 11.38% from 9.61%. Consequently, Return on Equity (ROE) and Return on Assets (ROA) rebounded to 10.75% and 6.13% respectively. However, the effective tax rate continued to climb, reaching 19.89%. | The submitted answer provides figures for profit after tax, underlying operating profit, operating margin, and underlying diluted EPS, but these do not match the ground truth figures for net profit margin, operating margin, ROE, ROA, or effective tax rate. The values and metrics discussed are entirely different. |
| 3.2.3 | Financial Performance Summary - Operational efficiency | 0.0000 | Incorrect | Operational efficiency remained strong, with underlying cash conversion at 102% (2023: 90%) and a 36-month rolling average of 101% (2023: 101%). Working capital as a percentage of revenue remained stable at 17% (2023: 17%). Inventory increased to £127.1m (2023: £101.7m) to secure supply chains. | Operational efficiency presented a positive picture. The operating margin improved to 11.38% from 9.61% in 2023, suggesting better operational control. The asset turnover slightly increased to 79.1% from 77.7%. On a positive note, net cash flow from operations was strong, increasing to £81.0m from £65.9m. | The submitted answer does not match the ground truth in terms of content. It discusses cash conversion and working capital, while the ground truth focuses on operating margin, asset turnover, and net cash flow from operations, which are entirely different metrics. |
| 3.2.4 | Financial Performance Summary - Financial risk identification and early warning | 0.0000 | Incorrect | Financial risk increased due to higher net debt and increased capital expenditure. Net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio rose to 0.56x (2023: 0.16x), though still below the internal target of <1.5x. The company secured an £80m UK Export Finance-backed loan, increasing accessible funding to £246m. | Financial risk increased in 2024. The Debt-to-Equity ratio rose sharply to 94.25% from 57.58%, indicating a significant increase in leverage. Liquidity weakened, with the current ratio decreasing to 119% from 129% in 2023. The interest coverage ratio, while still very high, decreased substantially from 3492% to 1210%. | The submitted answer discusses net debt and EBITDA ratio, while the ground truth focuses on Debt-to-Equity ratio, current ratio, and interest coverage ratio, which are entirely different metrics. Additionally, the year mentioned in the submitted answer is incorrect (2023 instead of 2024). |
| 3.2.5 | Financial Performance Summary - Future financial performance projection | 0.0000 | Incorrect | The company projects strong long-term growth, aiming for £1bn annual revenue by 2030. The record order book of £1,038m provides excellent medium-term revenue coverage, with 77% of 2025 revenue covered. Significant capital investment of £200m in Energetics is expected to add £100m revenue and £30m operating profit by 2028. | The company continues to invest in growth, with net cash used in investing increasing to £47.6m from £39.4m. Revenue growth is robust, driven by the Sensors & Information segment and expansion in the UK and Europe. The dividend payout ratio of 49.62% shows a continued commitment to shareholder returns, though the rising debt levels warrant monitoring. | The submitted answer does not match the ground truth in terms of content. It focuses on revenue projections and capital investment, while the ground truth discusses net cash used in investing, revenue growth drivers, dividend payout ratio, and debt levels, which are all missing in the submitted answer. |
