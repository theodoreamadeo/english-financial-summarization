| 3.1.1 | Profitability Analysis  - Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | 0.5000 | Partially Correct | Revenue Growth: Total operating revenue increased from US$13,310 million in 2023 to US$14,800 million in 2024, representing a growth of 11.2%. Gross Margin: Gross profit increased from US$6,825 million in 2023 to US$7,671 million in 2024. The gross profit margin remained relatively stable at approximately 51.8% in 2024 (US$7,671m / US$14,800m) compared to 51.3% in 2023 (US$6,844m / US$13,310m). Revenue by Product/Service: Immunoglobulins revenue grew significantly from US$4,675 million to US$5,666 million. Albumin also saw growth from US$1,109 million to US$1,209 million. Haemophilia products increased from US$1,193 million to US$1,313 million. CSL Seqirus' adjuvanted egg-based vaccines grew from US$893 million to US$1,040 million. CSL Vifor's iron products increased from US$1,009 million to US$1,018 million. Revenue by Geographic Region: The United States remained the largest revenue contributor, growing from US$6,563 million to US$7,294 million. Rest of World showed substantial growth from US$2,849 million to US$3,924 million. Australia's revenue decreased from US$1,045 million to US$900 million. | CSL demonstrated strong revenue growth over the three-year period, with 26.0% growth from 2022 to 2023 ($10,562M to $13,310M) followed by 11.2% growth from 2023 to 2024 ($13,310M to $14,800M). However, gross margin declined from 54.3% in 2022 to 51.3% in 2023, with modest recovery to 51.8% in 2024, indicating cost pressures despite revenue growth. Immunoglobulins remains the largest revenue driver, growing from $4,024M in 2022 to $5,666M in 2024. Geographically, the United States is the dominant market, expanding from $5,124M in 2022 to $7,294M in 2024, while other regions showed mixed performance with Rest of World segment nearly doubling from $2,013M to $3,924M. | The revenue growth figures from 2023 to 2024 and the gross profit margin for 2024 are correct. However, the gross profit margin for 2023 is incorrectly calculated, and the revenue figures for Immunoglobulins and the United States are inconsistent with the ground truth. The revenue by geographic region is also missing the 2022 figures for comparison. |
| 3.1.2 | Profitability Analysis  - Operating Efficiency | 0.0000 | Incorrect | Operating Margin: Operating profit (EBIT) increased from US$3,069 million in 2023 to US$3,812 million in 2024. The operating margin improved from 23.1% (US$3,069m / US$13,310m) in 2023 to 25.8% (US$3,812m / US$14,800m) in 2024, indicating enhanced operating efficiency. This improvement was driven by strong performance across CSL Behring's portfolio, especially immunoglobulins, and solid growth from CSL Seqirus. Cost of Sales: Cost of sales increased from US$6,485 million in 2023 to US$7,129 million in 2024, but at a slower rate than revenue growth, contributing to the stable gross margin. Operating Expenses: Research and development expenses increased from US$1,269 million to US$1,430 million. Selling and marketing expenses increased from US$1,481 million to US$1,573 million. General and administration expenses decreased from US$1,006 million to US$856 million, indicating cost control in this area. | Operating efficiency showed volatility over the period, with operating margin declining from 27.72% in 2022 to 23.06% in 2023, then recovering to 25.77% in 2024, though still below 2022 levels. Despite margin pressure, absolute operating income grew consistently from $2,927M in 2022 to $3,069M in 2023 and $3,812M in 2024, indicating effective cost management relative to revenue expansion. Operating expenses increased from $2,805M in 2022 to $3,859M in 2024, but the growth rate was controlled relative to revenue increases, demonstrating operational leverage benefits as the company scaled. | The submitted answer contains incorrect operating margin values for 2023 and 2024, and it does not mention the decline from 2022 to 2023. Additionally, the total operating expenses and their growth rates are not accurately represented compared to the ground truth. |
| 3.1.3 | Profitability Analysis  - External & One-Off Impact | 0.0000 | Incorrect | Effective Tax Rate: The effective tax rate decreased from 15.7% (US$419m / US$2,663m) in 2023 to 19.6% (US$661m / US$3,375m) in 2024. Non-Recurring Items: The unwind of CSL Vifor inventory fair value uplift decreased from US$169 million in 2023 to US$30 million in 2024. CSL Vifor acquisition and integration costs decreased from US$184 million in 2023 to US$54 million in 2024. These non-recurring items had a diminishing impact on profitability in 2024 compared to 2023. | The effective tax rate exhibited significant volatility, dropping from 18.90% in 2022 to 15.74% in 2023, then spiking to 19.59% in 2024, creating earnings volatility beyond operational performance. This tax rate fluctuation had material impact on net profitability, with income tax expense increasing from $525M in 2022 to $661M in 2024 despite the intermediate drop in 2023. The tax burden growth outpaced income growth, contributing to net profit margin compression from 21.37% in 2022 to 18.34% in 2024. Information regarding non-recurring items is not explicitly detailed in the provided financial statements, limiting analysis of one-time impacts on profitability. | The submitted answer contains incorrect effective tax rates for 2023 and 2024, and it misrepresents the trend and impact of non-recurring items. The ground truth specifies different values and trends that do not match the submitted figures. |

However, total liabilities also increased to US$18,621 million from US$18,408 million, leading to an increase in net assets to US$19,401 million from US$17,826 million. Equity attributable to shareholders of CSL Limited grew to US$17,363 million from US$15,786 million. The non-controlling interests remained stable at US$2,038 million. | CSL demonstrates robust financial health with total assets growing from $36,234M in 2023 to $38,022M in 2024, representing 4.9% growth. Shareholders' equity increased significantly from $15,786M in 2023 to $17,363M in 2024, strengthening the balance sheet foundation. The company maintained strong liquidity with current ratio of 217.6% compared to 200.9% in 2023. However, there was a notable shift in asset composition with current assets increasing while non-current assets remained relatively stable. Cash flow from operations remained healthy at $2,764M in 2024 versus $2,601M in 2023, indicating consistent operational cash generation capability. | The submitted answer contains incorrect year references (2023 instead of 2024) and omits key financial metrics such as the current ratio and cash flow from operations, which are essential for a comprehensive financial health summary. |
| 3.2.2 | Financial Performance Summary - Profitabilitiy and earnings quality | 0.0000 | Incorrect | Profitability and earnings quality improved significantly in 2024. Net profit for the year attributable to shareholders of CSL Limited increased to US$2,642 million from US$2,194 million in 2023, representing a 20.4% growth. Basic earnings per share (EPS) rose to US$5.47 from US$4.55. The operating margin improved to 25.8% from 23.1%, indicating better operational efficiency. The effective tax rate increased to 19.6% from 15.7%. | Profitability metrics showed mixed but generally positive trends in 2024. Net profit increased from $2,244M in 2023 to $2,714M in 2024, representing 20.9% growth and demonstrating strong earnings momentum. Net profit margin improved from 16.87% to 18.34%, while ROE increased from 13.85% to 14.58% and ROA from 7.0% to 7.3%, indicating enhanced efficiency in generating returns. However, earnings quality faced some pressure from higher effective tax rates, rising from 15.74% in 2023 to 19.59% in 2024. The dividend payout ratio decreased from 48.36% to 43.93%, suggesting management's confidence in retaining earnings for growth while maintaining shareholder returns. | The submitted answer contains incorrect figures for net profit, growth percentage, and the effective tax rate. The net profit was reported as US$2,642 million instead of US$2,714 million, and the growth was stated as 20.4% instead of 20.9%. Additionally, the effective tax rate was incorrectly reported as 19.6% instead of 19.59%. Other metrics such as net profit margin, ROE, and ROA were not mentioned at all. |
| 3.2.3 | Financial Performance Summary - Operational efficiency | 0.0000 | Incorrect | Operational efficiency continued to improve in 2024. The operating margin increased to 25.8% from 23.1% in 2023. Cash flow from operating activities increased to US$2,764 million from US$2,601 million, demonstrating strong cash generation. The ratio of operating cash flow to net profit improved, indicating higher quality earnings. | Operational efficiency showed improvement in 2024 with operating margin recovering to 25.77% from 23.06% in 2023, though still below optimal levels. Operating income grew strongly from $3,069M to $3,812M, representing 24.2% growth and outpacing revenue growth of 11.2%. Operating expenses increased from $3,756M to $3,859M, but the controlled 2.7% growth rate demonstrated effective cost management. Asset turnover remained relatively stable at 40.0% versus 41.2%, indicating consistent asset utilization efficiency. The company demonstrated operational leverage with operating income growth significantly exceeding expense growth. | The submitted answer contains incorrect values for operating margin (25.8% vs 25.77%), cash flow from operating activities (US$2,764 million vs US$3,069 million), and does not mention operating income or expenses, which are critical to the financial performance summary. |
