Gross Margin: The gross margin improved substantially from 56.9% in 2023 to 72.7% in 2024, an increase of 15.8 percentage points. This improvement was primarily driven by strong Data Center revenue growth and lower net inventory provisions as a percentage of revenue. Revenue by Product/Service: Data Center revenue surged by 217% from $15,005 million in 2023 to $47,525 million in 2024. Gaming revenue increased by 15% from $9,067 million in 2023 to $10,447 million in 2024.
