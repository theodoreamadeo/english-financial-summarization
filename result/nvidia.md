| 3.1.1 | Profitability Analysis  - Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | 0.0000 | Incorrect | Revenue Growth: NVIDIA Corporation experienced significant revenue growth from fiscal year 2023 to fiscal year 2024. Total revenue increased from $26,974 million in 2023 to $60,922 million in 2024, representing a growth of 125.8%. Gross Margin: The gross margin improved substantially from 56.9% in 2023 to 72.7% in 2024, an increase of 15.8 percentage points. This improvement was primarily driven by strong Data Center revenue growth and lower net inventory provisions as a percentage of revenue. Revenue by Product/Service: Data Center revenue surged by 217% from $15,005 million in 2023 to $47,525 million in 2024. Gaming revenue increased by 15% from $9,067 million in 2023 to $10,447 million in 2024.

Taiwan's revenue increased by 91.9% from $6,986 million in 2023 to $13,405 million in 2024. China (including Hong Kong) revenue increased by 78.1% from $5,785 million in 2023 to $10,306 million in 2024. Revenue from Other countries increased by 73.3% from $5,911 million in 2023 to $10,245 million in 2024. The proportion of revenue from sales outside the United States decreased from 69% in 2023 to 56% in 2024, indicating a stronger growth in the U.S. market. | Revenue experienced dramatic growth from 2022-2024, increasing 126% from 2022-2024, with the most significant jump occurring in 2024 (126% increase from 2023). This growth was primarily driven by the Compute & Networking segment, which became the dominant revenue driver, growing from $11,046M in 2022 to $47,405M in 2024. Graphics revenue declined from $15,868M in 2022 to $11,906M in 2023 but recovered to $13,517M in 2024.Geographically, the US became the largest market, growing from $4,349M in 2022 to $26,966M in 2024. Gross margin improved significantly to 72.72% in 2024 from 56.92% in 2023, though it remained below the 2022 level of 64.95%. The margin improvement in 2024 reflects better cost management and product mix optimization despite higher absolute costs. | The submitted answer contains multiple inaccuracies, including incorrect revenue figures for 2023 and 2024, incorrect percentage growth calculations, and discrepancies in product revenue details. The ground truth specifies different revenue figures and growth percentages, particularly for the Compute & Networking segment and Graphics revenue, which were not mentioned in the submitted answer. |
| 3.1.2 | Profitability Analysis  - Operating Efficiency | 0.9000 | Partially Correct | Operating Margin: The operating margin significantly improved from 15.6% in fiscal year 2023 to 54.1% in fiscal year 2024. This substantial increase reflects the company's ability to leverage its revenue growth more effectively into operating income, despite an increase in operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by growth in employees and compensation increases, but the revenue growth outpaced these costs. | Operating efficiency showed remarkable improvement, with operating margin reaching 54.13% in 2024, a substantial increase from 15.66% in 2023, and higher than 37.32% achieved in 2022. The 2023 decline to 15.66% represented a significant efficiency challenge, but the company demonstrated strong operational leverage in 2024. Operating income surged from $4,224M in 2023 to $32,972M in 2024, while operating expenses increased modestly from $11,132M to $11,329M, indicating excellent cost control and scalability of the business model during the revenue expansion. | The submitted answer correctly identifies the operating margin improvement and the factors contributing to it, but it inaccurately states the operating margin values (15.6% and 54.1% instead of 15.66% and 54.13%) and omits specific figures for operating income and expenses, which are critical for a complete analysis. |
| 3.1.3 | Profitability Analysis  - External & One-Off Impact | 0.0000 | Incorrect | Effective Tax Rate: The effective tax rate changed from a benefit of 4.5% in fiscal year 2023 to an expense of 12.0% in fiscal year 2024. This increase was due to a decreased impact of tax benefits from the FDII deduction, stock-based compensation, and the U.S. federal research tax credit, relative to the increase in income before income tax. The 2024 rate was partially offset by a benefit due to an IRS audit resolution. Non-Recurring Items: In fiscal year 2023, the company recorded an acquisition termination cost of $1,353 million related to the proposed Arm transaction. This non-recurring expense significantly impacted operating expenses and net income in 2023. In fiscal year 2024, there was no such acquisition termination cost. The fiscal year 2024 also included a non-cash net benefit of $145 million from an IRS audit resolution. The net effect on gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 7.5% in 2023, which improved to an unfavorable impact of 2.7% in 2024. | The effective tax rate showed significant variation across the period, moving from 1.90% in 2022 to -4.47% in 2023 (indicating a tax benefit), and then to 12.00% in 2024. The negative tax rate in 2023 provided a one-time benefit to profitability, with the company receiving a tax benefit of $187M despite having pre-tax income of $4,181M. In 2024, the normalization of the tax rate to 12.00% represented a more typical tax burden, with tax expense of $4,058M on pre-tax income of $33,818M. This tax normalization had a moderating effect on net profit growth compared to the exceptional 2023 tax benefit. | The submitted answer incorrectly states the effective tax rates for fiscal years 2023 and 2024, and it does not mention the tax benefit amount or pre-tax income figures provided in the ground truth. Additionally, the details regarding the non-recurring items and their financial impact do not align with the ground truth information. |
| 3.2.1 | Financial Performance Summary - Comprehensive financial health | 0.5000 | Partially Correct | NVIDIA's financial health significantly improved in fiscal year 2024, driven by robust revenue growth and enhanced profitability. Total assets increased by 59.6% to $65,728 million from $41,182 million in 2023. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities rose by 95.4% to $25,984 million, indicating strong liquidity. Accounts receivable increased by 161.3% to $9,999 million, reflecting higher sales. Total liabilities increased by 19.2% to $22,750 million, while total shareholders' equity surged by 94.4% to $42,978 million, demonstrating a stronger capital structure. The company's ability to generate cash from operations also saw a substantial increase. | Exceptional financial health with total assets growing to $65,728M and shareholders' equity increasing to $42,978M. Strong balance sheet with current ratio of 417.13% and debt-to-equity ratio improved to 52.94%. Cash flow from operations reached $28,090M demonstrating robust cash generation capabilities. | The submitted answer correctly states total assets and shareholders' equity but misses the current ratio and debt-to-equity ratio. It also provides cash flow from operations, but the figure is incorrect compared to the ground truth. |
| 3.2.2 | Financial Performance Summary - Profitabilitiy and earnings quality | 0.5000 | Partially Correct | Profitability and earnings quality saw a dramatic improvement in fiscal year 2024. Net income soared by 581.4% to $29,760 million from $4,368 million in 2023. The net profit margin increased from 16.2% to 48.9%. Return on Equity (ROE) significantly improved from 19.76% to 69.24%. Return on Assets (ROA) also saw a substantial increase from 10.61% to 45.28%. The effective tax rate shifted from a benefit of 4.5% to an expense of 12.0%, reflecting higher taxable income. The absence of the large acquisition termination cost from the prior year also contributed to the improved earnings quality. | Outstanding profitability with net profit margin of 48.85% and net profit of $29,760M. Return on equity reached 97.68% and return on assets 45.27%. Effective tax rate normalized to 12.00%. Revenue growth of 126% driven primarily by Compute & Networking segment ($47,405M). | The submitted answer correctly states the net income and net profit margin but has discrepancies in ROE (reported as 69.24% vs. 97.68%) and ROA (reported as 45.28% vs. 45.27%). The effective tax rate is correctly reported as 12.0%. Revenue growth and details about the Compute & Networking segment are missing. |
| 3.2.3 | Financial Performance Summary - Operational efficiency | 0.0000 | Incorrect | Operational efficiency improved significantly in fiscal year 2024. The operating margin increased from 15.6% to 54.1%, indicating better cost management relative to revenue growth. Asset turnover improved from 0.65 to 0.93, suggesting more efficient utilization of assets to generate sales. The increase in revenue outpaced the growth in operating expenses, which rose by only 2% despite significant revenue growth. This demonstrates strong operational leverage and effective management of direct costs. | Exceptional operational efficiency with operating margin of 54.13% and operating income of $32,972M. Operating expenses well-controlled at $11,329M despite massive revenue growth. Asset turnover improved to 116.92%. Gross margin reached 72.72% indicating strong pricing power and cost management. | The submitted answer contains incorrect values for operating margin (54.1% vs. 54.13%), asset turnover (0.93 vs. 116.92%), and does not mention operating income or gross margin, which are critical metrics in the ground truth. |
| 3.2.4 | Financial Performance Summary - Financial risk identification and early warning | 0.0000 | Incorrect | Financial risk indicators remained manageable in fiscal year 2024 despite increased debt. The debt-to-equity ratio decreased from 43.9% to 22.0%, indicating a significant reduction in financial leverage. The current ratio improved from 3.52 to 4.17, showing enhanced short-term liquidity. Interest coverage ratio improved significantly due to higher operating income. The company's strong cash flow from operations provides a substantial buffer against financial distress. The increase in prepaid supply and capacity agreements to $2,458 million (long-term) and $2,500 million (short-term) indicates strategic investments to secure future supply, which could be a risk if demand forecasts are inaccurate, but currently reflects strong growth expectations. | Low financial risk profile with strong liquidity ratios and improved debt management. Interest coverage ratio of 12,828.40% indicates minimal debt service risk. Dividend payout ratio of only 1.33% suggests conservative capital allocation. Geographic concentration risk with US representing 44% of revenue and China exposure at $10,306M. | The submitted answer does not match the ground truth in key financial metrics such as the interest coverage ratio (12,828.40% vs. unspecified in the submission) and the dividend payout ratio (1.33% missing). Additionally, it lacks information on geographic concentration risk, which is critical in assessing financial risk. |
| 3.2.5 | Financial Performance Summary - Future financial performance projection | 0.0000 | Incorrect | NVIDIA's future financial performance is projected to be strong, driven by continued demand for Data Center products, especially in AI and LLMs. The company's strategic investments in supply and capacity agreements, along with a broader and faster Data Center product launch cadence, position it for sustained growth.
