# Section 3: Business Analysis

## 3.1 Profitability Analysis

| Perspective | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Consolidated revenues for UnitedHealth Group increased by 8.00% from $371,622 million in 2023 to $400,278 million in 2024. This growth was primarily driven by Optum Rx (15.00% increase), UnitedHealthcare's domestic offerings (6.00% increase), and Optum Health (11.00% increase). However, this was partially offset by the sale of UnitedHealthcare's Brazil operations. The gross margin, calculated as (Total Revenues - Medical Costs - Cost of Products Sold) / Total Revenues, decreased from 25.99% in 2023 to 22.49% in 2024. This decline indicates that direct costs (medical costs and cost of products sold) grew at a faster rate than total revenues. Medical costs increased by 9.29% from $241,894 million in 2023 to $264,185 million in 2024, and cost of products sold increased by 20.44% from $38,770 million to $46,694 million. Revenue distribution by segment shows UnitedHealthcare contributing $298,208 million (74.50%) in 2024 compared to $281,360 million (75.72%) in 2023, while Optum contributed $252,957 million (63.19%) in 2024 compared to $226,635 million (60.99%) in 2023. The Optum segment's share of total revenue increased, indicating its growing importance. Revenue by geographic region shows U.S. customer revenue representing approximately 99.00% of consolidated total revenues in 2024, an increase from 97.00% in 2023, suggesting a greater reliance on the domestic market. |
| Operating Efficiency | The company's operating efficiency, as measured by the operating margin (Earnings from Operations / Total Revenues), decreased from 8.71% in 2023 to 8.07% in 2024. This indicates a slight decline in the company's ability to convert revenue into operating profit. Operating costs (excluding medical costs and cost of products sold) decreased by 2.96% from $54,628 million in 2023 to $53,013 million in 2024. This decrease in operating costs, despite revenue growth, suggests some level of cost management. However, the overall operating margin was negatively impacted by the Change Healthcare cyberattack, which incurred $2.2 billion in direct response costs and $867 million in business disruption impacts for Optum Insight in 2024. The operating cost ratio (Operating Costs / Total Revenues) improved from 14.70% in 2023 to 13.24% in 2024, primarily due to operating cost management and gains related to business portfolio refinement, partially offset by the cyberattack's impact and investments for future growth. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 20.50% in 2023 to 24.06% in 2024. This increase in the tax rate negatively impacted net earnings. The most significant non-recurring item affecting profitability in 2024 was the "Loss on sale of subsidiary and subsidiaries held for sale," amounting to $8,310 million. This loss was primarily due to the sale of Brazil operations ($7.1 billion loss, including $4.1 billion in cumulative foreign currency translation losses) and the reclassification of remaining South American operations as held for sale ($1.2 billion loss, including $855 million in cumulative foreign currency translation losses). These non-recurring losses significantly reduced earnings before income taxes from $29,112 million in 2023 to $20,071 million in 2024, and consequently, net earnings attributable to common shareholders decreased by 35.66% from $22,381 million to $14,405 million. In 2023, there were no such material non-recurring items impacting profitability to this extent. |

## 3.2 Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | The company's financial health remained strong, with total assets increasing by 8.97% to $298,278 million from $273,720 million in 2023. Total liabilities increased by 11.95% to $195,687 million, and total equity increased by 4.07% to $98,268 million. The current ratio (Current Assets / Current Liabilities) slightly decreased from 0.79 in 2023 to 0.83 in 2024, indicating a stable short-term liquidity position. The debt-to-equity ratio (Total Liabilities / Total Equity) increased from 1.85 in 2023 to 1.99 in 2024, suggesting a slightly higher reliance on debt financing. Cash flows from operating activities decreased by 16.74% to $24,204 million from $29,068 million in 2023, primarily due to Medicare funding reductions, Change Healthcare cyberattack response actions, increased medical costs, and changes in working capital. | The company demonstrated solid financial health, with total assets growing by 11.46% to $273,720 million from $245,705 million in 2022. Total liabilities increased by 9.79% to $174,801 million, and total equity increased by 15.93% to $94,421 million. The current ratio (Current Assets / Current Liabilities) was 0.79, indicating adequate short-term liquidity. The debt-to-equity ratio was 1.85, reflecting a balanced capital structure. Cash flows from operating activities increased by 10.92% to $29,068 million from $26,206 million in 2022, driven by changes in working capital and increased net earnings. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability significantly declined in 2024, with net earnings attributable to common shareholders decreasing by 35.66% to $14,405 million from $22,381 million in 2023. Diluted earnings per common share decreased by 35.00% to $15.51 from $23.86. The net earnings margin (Net Earnings Attributable to UnitedHealth Group Common Shareholders / Total Revenues) fell from 6.02% in 2023 to 3.60% in 2024. Return on equity (Net Earnings Attributable to UnitedHealth Group Common Shareholders / Average Shareholders' Equity) decreased substantially from 27.00% to 15.90%. This decline was largely due to the $8,310 million loss on the sale of subsidiaries and the impact of the Change Healthcare cyberattack. | The company showed strong profitability and earnings quality in 2023, with net earnings attributable to common shareholders increasing by 11.24% to $22,381 million from $20,120 million in 2022. Diluted earnings per common share increased by 12.65% to $23.86 from $21.18. The net earnings margin was 6.02%. Return on equity was 27.00%, indicating efficient use of shareholder capital. There were no significant non-recurring items negatively impacting profitability in 2023. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency saw a slight decline in 2024, with the operating margin decreasing to 8.07% from 8.71% in 2023. This was primarily influenced by the Change Healthcare cyberattack, which led to $2.2 billion in direct response costs and $867 million in business disruption impacts for Optum Insight. The medical care ratio (Medical Costs / Premium Revenue) increased from 83.20% in 2023 to 85.50% in 2024, indicating a higher proportion of premium revenue being spent on medical costs. The operating cost ratio (Operating Costs / Total Revenues) improved from 14.70% to 13.24%, reflecting effective cost management in other areas, but not enough to offset the impact of higher medical costs and the cyberattack. | Operational efficiency remained stable in 2023, with the operating margin at 8.71%, a slight decrease from 8.77% in 2022. The medical care ratio increased from 82.00% in 2022 to 83.20% in 2023, primarily due to elevated care activity for seniors and business mix changes. The operating cost ratio remained consistent at 14.70%, indicating effective cost management despite investments to support future growth. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk increased in 2024 due to the significant non-recurring losses from dispositions and the impact of the Change Healthcare cyberattack. The increase in the debt-to-equity ratio to 1.99 suggests a higher leverage. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities by 16.74% also signals potential liquidity challenges if these trends persist. The company's exposure to regulatory changes, particularly in Medicare Advantage funding, remains a key risk. The cyberattack highlighted significant operational and reputational risks. | Financial risk remained manageable in 2023. The debt-to-equity ratio of 1.85 was stable. Cash flows from operating activities were strong, providing ample liquidity. Key risks identified included pressures on Medicare Advantage funding, increased care patterns (especially for seniors), and the impact of Medicaid redeterminations on membership levels. The company's global operations also exposed it to foreign currency exchange rate risks, particularly with the Brazilian real and Chilean peso. |
| Future financial performance projection | The future financial performance projection for 2025 is mixed. The company expects continued direct response costs and business disruption impacts from the Change Healthcare cyberattack, albeit at a lesser extent. Pressures on Medicare Advantage funding are anticipated to continue, and the gap between people's health status and Medicaid rates is expected to narrow. The company's strategy focuses on accelerating the transition to value-based care, which requires initial costs but aims for lower overall health system costs over time. The significant non-recurring losses from dispositions in 2024 will not recur, potentially improving reported net earnings in 2025. | The future financial performance projection for 2024 was influenced by several trends. The company anticipated continued pressure on Medicare Advantage funding and increased care patterns, particularly for outpatient procedures for seniors. Medicaid redeterminations were expected to impact membership. The company aimed to mitigate these trends through engaging physicians and consumers with information and promoting clinically sound choices. The pending disposition of Brazil operations was expected to result in a significant loss in early 2024. |

## 3.3 Business Competitiveness

| Field | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Business Model | UnitedHealth Group operates a diversified healthcare and well-being business model through two complementary segments: Optum and UnitedHealthcare. UnitedHealthcare offers a full range of health benefits, including risk-based products (assuming medical and administrative costs for a monthly premium) and administrative services (fixed monthly service fee for self-funded customers). Optum is an information and technology-enabled health services business, comprising Optum Health (patient-centered care, value-based arrangements, health financial services), Optum Insight (data, analytics, technology, and managed services for healthcare systems), and Optum Rx (pharmacy care services, including retail, home delivery, and specialty pharmacies). The company generates revenue from premiums, product sales (pharmaceuticals), and services (fees for care delivery, technology solutions, and administrative services). Its target customer segments include patients, consumers, care providers, businesses, employers, governments, and life sciences companies. A unique aspect is the integration of Optum's capabilities to coordinate patient care, improve affordability, analyze cost trends, and manage pharmacy services for UnitedHealthcare, creating an end-to-end offering. | UnitedHealth Group operates a diversified healthcare and well-being business model through its Optum and UnitedHealthcare segments.

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | The company faces significant competition across all markets, including from startups and large enterprises, which could make it difficult to retain or increase its customer base and profitability. Failure to innovate and deliver valuable products and services, especially in care models and technology, could lead to competitive disadvantages and loss of market share. Unfavorable economic conditions, such as inflation and labor market dynamics, may reduce demand for products and services, impact pricing, and constrain government budgets, leading to reduced reimbursements. Public health crises, natural disasters, and climate change effects could increase operating costs and medical care costs, and reduce demand for services. | The company faces significant competition across all markets, including from startups and large enterprises, which could make it difficult to retain or increase its customer base and profitability.

Public health crises, natural disasters, and climate change effects could increase operating costs and medical care costs, and reduce demand for services. |
| Operational Risks | The company's operations are highly dependent on the integrity and timeliness of data and information systems. Failures in these systems, including those incorporating AI/ML, could lead to inaccurate medical cost estimates, customer disputes, regulatory sanctions, and increased operating expenses. Cyberattacks and other privacy or data security incidents, such as the Change Healthcare cyberattack in 2024, pose significant risks, potentially causing operational disruptions, data breaches, financial liabilities, and reputational harm. The company also relies on third-party vendors, whose operations are subject to similar risks but are outside direct oversight. Maintaining satisfactory relationships with healthcare payers, physicians, hospitals, and other service providers is crucial; failure to do so could lead to higher medical costs, less desirable products, and disputes. The success of strategic alliances and the integration of acquisitions also present operational challenges, including potential IT system vulnerabilities and litigation risks from acquired businesses. | The company's operations are highly dependent on the integrity and timeliness of data and information systems.

The success of strategic alliances and the integration of acquisitions also present operational challenges, including potential IT system vulnerabilities and litigation risks from acquired businesses. |
| Financial Risks | The profitability of risk-based products and services is highly dependent on the ability to accurately estimate, price for, and manage medical costs. Inaccurate predictions or ineffective management of these costs, influenced by factors like medical cost inflation, increased service utilization, and new drug prices, could materially and adversely affect financial results. The company's investment portfolio is exposed to market fluctuations, particularly in interest rates, which could impair its value and profitability. Downgrades in credit ratings could increase borrowing and operating costs. The value of goodwill and other intangible assets, which represent 44% of total consolidated assets, is subject to impairment if acquired businesses underperform, potentially affecting results of operations, equity, and credit ratings.
