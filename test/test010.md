# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | The company's revenue increased from RM1,116,909.00 thousand in 2023 to RM1,146,947.00 thousand in 2024, representing a growth of 2.69%. The gross margin slightly increased from 33.35% in 2023 to 34.98% in 2024. This improvement in gross margin indicates better cost management relative to revenue growth. The construction division remained the main revenue driver, contributing RM527,218.00 thousand (47.20%) in 2023 and increasing to RM640,693.00 thousand (55.86%) in 2024. The toll operations division was the second largest contributor, with RM287,728.00 thousand (25.76%) in 2023 and RM310,838.00 thousand (27.10%) in 2024. The property development division saw a significant decrease in revenue, from RM139,090.00 thousand (12.45%) in 2023 to RM30,132.00 thousand (2.63%) in 2024. The plantation division's revenue slightly decreased from RM118,280.00 thousand (10.59%) in 2023 to RM114,888.00 thousand (10.02%) in 2024. The property investment division showed growth from RM30,037.00 thousand (2.69%) in 2023 to RM34,163.00 thousand (2.98%) in 2024. Geographically, Malaysia remained the primary revenue source, contributing RM1,096,243.00 thousand in 2023 and RM1,125,128.00 thousand in 2024. In 2024, new revenue streams emerged from the United States of America (RM847.00 thousand) and Japan (RM98.00 thousand), while revenue from the People's Republic of China remained stable at RM20,666.00 thousand in 2023 and RM20,874.00 thousand in 2024. |
| Operating Efficiency | The company's operating efficiency deteriorated, with operating income (loss before tax) decreasing from a loss of RM9,855.00 thousand in 2023 to a loss of RM50,394.00 thousand in 2024. The operating margin (loss before tax as a percentage of revenue) worsened from -0.88% in 2023 to -4.39% in 2024. This decline was primarily driven by a substantial increase in finance costs, which rose from RM246,570.00 thousand in 2023 to RM380,830.00 thousand in 2024, an increase of 54.08%. This increase in finance costs was mainly due to the discontinuation of financing cost capitalization for the SPE Highway upon its commencement of operation in November 2023. Administrative and general expenses decreased from RM114,782.00 thousand in 2023 to RM98,501.00 thousand in 2024, indicating some cost management efforts. However, these efforts were offset by the higher finance costs and an increase in loss allowance on trade and other receivables from RM7,458.00 thousand in 2023 to RM1,587.00 thousand in 2024. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased significantly from -1,009.38% in 2023 to -134.56% in 2024. This unusual negative effective tax rate is primarily due to the company reporting a loss before tax while still incurring tax expenses. In 2023, the company reported a loss before tax of RM9,855.00 thousand and a tax expense of RM99,469.00 thousand. In 2024, the loss before tax increased to RM50,394.00 thousand, with a tax expense of RM67,814.00 thousand. The high tax expense relative to the loss before tax is mainly attributed to the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for the toll operations' segment, specifically the unrecognition of deferred tax assets accumulated from unabsorbed business losses due to a 10-year limitation imposed by Section 44(5F) of the Income Tax Act. This indicates a significant non-recurring impact on profitability due to tax accounting adjustments rather than operational performance. |

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | The company's comprehensive financial health shows a slight decrease in total equity from RM2,796,470.00 thousand in 2023 to RM2,815,806.00 thousand in 2024, despite an increase in share capital due to a private placement.

| Profitability and earnings quality | The company's profitability deteriorated, with a net loss after tax of RM118,208.00 thousand in 2024, compared to a net loss of RM109,324.00 thousand in 2023. The loss attributable to owners of the company increased from RM111,115.00 thousand to RM122,955.00 thousand. Basic earnings per share worsened from (4.12) sen to (4.22) sen. The quality of earnings was significantly impacted by high finance costs (RM380,830.00 thousand) and deferred tax expenses (RM67,814.00 thousand), which overshadowed a modest revenue growth of 2.69%. | The company reported a net loss after tax of RM109,324.00 thousand in 2023, with a loss attributable to owners of the company of RM111,115.00 thousand. Basic earnings per share was (4.12) sen. Profitability was negatively affected by a loss before tax of RM9,855.00 thousand and a significant deferred tax expense of RM99,469.00 thousand, mainly from toll operations. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency declined, as evidenced by the worsening loss before tax from RM9,855.00 thousand in 2023 to RM50,394.00 thousand in 2024. The operating margin (loss before tax as a percentage of revenue) decreased from -0.88% to -4.39%. While administrative and general expenses decreased, the substantial increase in finance costs due to the SPE Highway's operational commencement and non-capitalization of these costs significantly impacted operational performance. | Operational efficiency was challenged in 2023, with a loss before tax of RM9,855.00 thousand. The operating margin was -0.88%. Revenue increased by 38.10% due to increased construction activities and improved toll volumes, but this was largely offset by rising costs and deferred tax expenses. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | The company faces increased liquidity risk, with net current liabilities worsening from RM134,093.00 thousand in 2023 to RM603,579.00 thousand in 2024. This indicates a growing challenge in meeting short-term obligations. The significant increase in finance costs and deferred tax liabilities also highlights financial strain. The company is actively pursuing asset disposals and credit facilities to manage this risk. | In 2023, the company reported net current liabilities of RM134,093.00 thousand, indicating potential short-term liquidity challenges. The company's financial risk was also influenced by a substantial deferred tax expense of RM99,469.00 thousand. |
| Future financial performance projection | The company projects improved financial performance in 2025, driven by new projects like the EkoTitiwangsa development (estimated GDV of RM500.00 million), expected toll compensation for DUKE 1 & 2 (RM64.00 million), and progress claims from the RTS Link Project. Strategic asset disposals (RM77.00 million in land, RM72.00 million in equipment) and new credit facilities (RM100.00 million) are expected to bolster cash flow and liquidity. The proposed reorganisation and merger are also aimed at strengthening the financial position and diversifying revenue streams. | The company anticipated a challenging but improving environment in 2023, with expectations of continued growth in the construction sector and recovery in the property market. The full opening of the SPE and increased traffic volumes were expected to boost toll revenue. The plantation division was undergoing a transition to diversify into the broader agrofood industry, with a longer gestation period for durian trees. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | The Malaysian economy is resilient, with GDP expected to grow by 4% to 5% in 2024. The construction sector is forecasted to increase by 6.8% in 2024, driven by large infrastructure projects (LRT3, MRT3, RTS, Pan Borneo highways) and increased investment in industrial and energy projects. The property sector is poised for sustainable growth in 2024, with strong economic momentum and significant investments. The agriculture sector is expected to expand due to a recovery in oil palm production. However, the Group acknowledges escalating uncertainties in the global landscape and challenges in the property market. The plantation division faces moderated crude palm oil prices, inflationary pressures on operational costs, and adverse weather effects on durian production. The Group's strategy involves diversifying businesses to reduce dependency on construction, property development, and toll operations, which are subject to changing and uncertain landscapes. | The Malaysian construction industry is expected to grow steadily in 2023, driven by the full resumption of activities across all subsectors, including major infrastructure projects (LRT3, MRT3, RTS, Pan Borneo highways) and utility projects. The property sector is poised for sustainable growth in 2023, despite subdued market sentiments, due to strong economic momentum and government incentives. The agriculture sector is expected to expand due to a recovery in oil palm production. However, the Group acknowledges challenges from waning demand, high material costs, increased interest rates, and inflationary pressures impacting consumer spending. The ongoing pandemic and MCO reimposition continue to affect Malaysia's economy, exerting negative pressure on private consumption. The plantation division faces moderated crude palm oil prices, inflationary pressures on operational costs, and adverse weather effects on durian production. |
| Operational Risks | The construction division faced challenges in FYE2024, including supply chain disruptions, unpredictable material price fluctuations, and a tight labor market post-COVID-19. The SPE project experienced delays due to changes in alignment and interfacing issues with other government projects. The toll operations division experienced a significant financial gap due to lost toll collection opportunities during the pandemic, impacting cash flow and financial commitments to sukukholders. The plantation division faced lower yields and required rehabilitation works due to less-than-optimal conditions and inclement weather, compounded by slower off-take of downstream durian products by export customers. The Group is intensely focused on cultivating growth drivers and rejuvenating key management teams to drive operational and cost efficiency. | The construction division faced challenges in FYE2023, including supply chain disruptions, unpredictable material price fluctuations, and a tight labor market post-COVID-19.

The Group is focused on adapting to challenges and driving operational and cost efficiency. |
| Financial Risks | The Group reported a higher loss before tax of RM50.4 million in FYE2024 compared to RM9.9 million in FYE2023, primarily due to the discontinuation of financing cost capitalization for the SPE Highway upon its completion in November 2023, and the non-receipt of toll compensation for the 2023 toll rate hike deferral (RM64.0 million) for DUKE 1 & 2. Additionally, the Group was unable to recognize the scheduled toll rate for DUKE 1 & 2 due on January 1, 2024. The net loss after tax was RM118.2 million, impacted by deferred tax expenses of RM35.6 million from toll operations due to the 10-year limitation on carrying forward unabsorbed business losses. Concession Assets increased from RM7.7 billion to RM8.0 billion, while Investment Funds, Short Term Deposits, and Cash and Bank Balances decreased from RM675.3 million to RM482.6 million, reflecting funds used for DUKE Phase 3 construction and financing.

The Group reported net current liabilities of RM134 million in FYE2023. |
| Compliance Risks | The Group is exposed to compliance risks related to regulatory changes and legal issues, particularly concerning toll compensation and scheduled toll rate recognition.

The Group is also engaged in discussions with SPE sukukholders and the Government to resolve financial obligations and ensure long-term stability.
