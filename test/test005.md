## 4.1 Risk Factors

### 4.1.1. Market Risks

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---------- | :---------- | :---------- |
| Competition and Innovation | CSL recognizes that an impediment to delivering on its innovation and sustainable growth strategies is the changing competitive landscape for new technologies and disruptive therapies, such as gene and cell therapies. This material risk may alter the economics and characteristics of, and the demand for, CSL's plasma and adjacent therapies, and may also affect the platforms and capabilities in plasma protein technology, recombinant protein technology, cell and gene therapy and vaccines technology. Failure to capitalize on innovative technology will diminish growth in this product sector, whereas success will deliver competitive advantages. | CSL recognizes that an impediment to delivering on its innovation and sustainable growth strategies is the changing competitive landscape for new technologies and disruptive therapies, such as gene and cell therapies. This material risk may alter the economics and characteristics of, and the demand for, CSL's plasma and adjacent therapies, and may also affect its platforms and capabilities in plasma fractionation, recombinant technology, cell and gene therapy and vaccines technology. Failure to capitalize on innovative technology will diminish growth in this product sector, whereas success will deliver competitive advantages. |
| Market Access and Pricing | In most countries, pricing and access are determined by the country's P&R (pricing & reimbursement) authorities, based on clinical and economic evidence as well as patient outcomes, using strict appraisal processes. Policy making may involve multi-stakeholder engagement, which includes governments, payers/insurers, patient advocacy groups, medical societies and non-governmental organizations. CSL recognizes that if it is not successful in maintaining an economic and reliable supply of its therapies for its stakeholders, or does not adopt responsible pricing, it may adversely affect its ability to execute its strategy, deliver sustainable growth and uphold CSL's corporate reputation. CSL further recognizes that as a result of macroeconomic pressures and other factors, governments and payers around the world are putting more emphasis on affordable pricing and equitable patient access. | Policy making around market access is a multi-stakeholder engagement process, which includes governments, payers/insurers, patient advocacy groups, medical societies and non-governmental organizations.

| Clinical Trials and Product Safety | Patient safety is paramount for CSL's ongoing sustainability as a global biotechnology leader and CSL's long-term strategy of efficiency and reliable supply. When CSL talks about patient safety, CSL means both in the use and administration of registered products as well as in the conduct of CSL clinical trials. Occasionally, patients and trial participants may sometimes experience adverse reactions to therapies, CSL's manufacturing, product quality assurance and pharmacovigilance practices serve to provide high standards of safety and preserve CSL's reputational integrity. Clinical studies in new therapeutic and disease areas carry an inherent higher initial risk of failure as well as operational and technical challenges, due to the potential for knowledge gaps in the relevant medical, scientific and regulatory environment and the uncertainty of therapeutic outcomes. | Patient safety is paramount for CSL's ongoing sustainability as a global biotechnology leader and its long-term strategy of efficiency and reliable supply.
