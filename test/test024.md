# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue Growth | In 2024, the company's revenue decreased by 1.10% to £4,390.10 million from £4,438.60 million in 2023. This contrasts with the 2023 period, which saw an 8.21% increase in revenue from £4,101.80 million in 2022 to £4,438.60 million. The 2024 decline was primarily due to a 9% impact from disposals and a 2% currency translation headwind, offsetting an 11% organic growth. In 2023, organic growth was 10%, with a 2% reduction from acquisitions and disposals. |
| Gross Margin | The gross margin cannot be directly calculated from the provided data as the cost of revenue is not separately disclosed from other operating costs. |
| Revenue by Product/Service | In 2024, revenue from the provision of services (transferred over time) was £3,743.90 million, and from the sale of goods (transferred over time and at a point in time) was £639.10 million. In 2023, revenue from the provision of services was £3,822.10 million, and from the sale of goods was £614.80 million. The proportion of revenue from services remained dominant, though it slightly decreased in 2024. |
| Revenue by Geographic Region | In 2024, the United Kingdom generated £3,081.10 million in revenue, followed by Nuclear at £1,520.90 million, Land at £1,098.60 million, and Aviation at £341.50 million. In 2023, the United Kingdom generated £2,693.30 million, followed by Rest of Europe at £601.00 million, Africa at £329.30 million, North America at £188.10 million, and Australasia at £349.50 million. The UK remains the largest revenue contributor, with Nuclear and Land showing significant growth in 2024. |

## S3.1.2: Operating Efficiency

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Operating Expenses | In 2024, total operating costs were £4,145.00 million, a decrease from £4,315.70 million in 2023. This reduction in operating costs contributed to an improved operating profit despite a slight revenue decline. The 2023 operating costs were higher than the £4,040.60 million in 2022. |
| Operating Income | The statutory operating profit increased significantly to £241.60 million in 2024 from £45.50 million in 2023. This represents a substantial recovery from the previous year's lower profit, which was heavily impacted by specific adjusting items. In 2023, the operating profit was £45.50 million, a sharp decrease from £226.80 million in 2022. |
| Operating Margin | The statutory operating margin improved to 5.50% in 2024 from 1.00% in 2023. This indicates enhanced operational efficiency and better cost management. The 2023 operating margin of 1.00% was a significant drop from 5.50% in 2022, primarily due to the Type 31 loss and other specific adjusting items. |
| Trends in Cost Management and Operational Performance | In 2024, the company demonstrated improved cost management, with operating costs decreasing by 3.96% while revenue only slightly declined. This led to a substantial increase in operating profit and margin. The 2023 period was characterized by significant cost pressures and one-off losses, particularly the £100.10 million loss on the Type 31 contract, which severely impacted profitability. Excluding this loss, the underlying operating margin in 2023 would have been 6.30%, indicating better underlying performance. The company's focus on a stronger control environment and operational improvement initiatives, such as those in the DSG contract, contributed to these positive trends. |

## S3.1.3: External & One-Off Impact

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Effective Tax Rate | In 2024, the effective tax rate was 23.50%, a decrease from 2023's -1,274.20% (statutory) and 31.50% (underlying). The 2023 statutory rate was heavily influenced by a very low profit before tax. The underlying effective tax rate in 2024 was 26.60%, reflecting higher underlying pre-tax profit and a higher UK corporation tax rate. In 2023, the underlying effective tax rate was 32.00%, or 26.00% excluding the Type 31 loss. |
| Non-Recurring Items | In 2024, specific adjusting items impacting operating profit resulted in a net gain of £3.80 million, primarily due to business acquisition, merger, and divestment related items (net gain of £8.20 million) and fair value movement on derivatives (£6.40 million), partially offset by amortisation of acquired intangibles (£10.80 million). In 2023, specific adjusting items resulted in a net loss of £132.40 million, largely driven by a £117.70 million loss on business acquisition, merger, and divestment related items (mainly European AES disposal) and £15.80 million in amortisation of acquired intangibles. The Type 31 contract loss of £90.00 million in 2024 (vs. £100.10 million in 2023) was a significant non-recurring item impacting underlying operating profit. |

Total assets decreased to £3,309.90 million from £4,600.70 million in 2022, largely due to disposals. Total equity attributable to owners of the parent was £353.90 million, down from £682.00 million in 2022. Net debt decreased to £564.40 million from £968.70 million, and net debt excluding leases was £346.20 million, down from £556.70 million. The net debt/EBITDA (covenant basis) improved to 1.50x from 1.80x, reflecting efforts to strengthen the balance sheet through disposals and cash generation. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability saw a strong rebound in 2024. Statutory profit for the year was £168.20 million, a significant improvement from a loss of £33.30 million in 2023. Basic EPS increased to 32.90p from -6.90p. Underlying operating profit increased by 33.67% to £237.80 million from £177.90 million. The underlying operating margin improved to 5.40% from 4.00%. The Type 31 contract loss decreased to £90.00 million from £100.10 million, contributing to better earnings quality. | In 2023, profitability was severely impacted, resulting in a statutory loss for the year of £33.30 million, down from a profit of £167.90 million in 2022. Basic EPS was -6.90p, a decline from 32.50p. Underlying operating profit decreased by 25.24% to £177.90 million from £237.70 million, primarily due to the £100.10 million loss on the Type 31 contract. The underlying operating margin decreased to 4.00% from 5.80%. Excluding the Type 31 loss, underlying operating profit would have been £278.00 million, and underlying basic EPS 33.80p, indicating better underlying earnings quality. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency improved notably in 2024. The underlying operating margin increased to 5.40% from 4.00% in 2023. Underlying operating cash conversion was 136.00%, reflecting strong cash generation. Net capital expenditure increased to £111.80 million from £86.20 million, indicating continued investment in operations. Working capital movements resulted in an inflow of £127.50 million, demonstrating effective working capital management. | Operational efficiency faced challenges in 2023. The underlying operating margin decreased to 4.00% from 5.80% in 2022, largely due to the Type 31 loss. Underlying operating cash conversion was 173.00%, significantly higher than 2.00% in 2022, driven by reduced working capital and lower capital expenditure. Net capital expenditure decreased to £86.20 million from £135.20 million. Working capital movements resulted in an inflow of £103.50 million, a substantial improvement from an outflow of £173.90 million in 2022. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk significantly decreased in 2024. Net debt/EBITDA (covenant basis) improved to 0.80x from 1.50x, well within the target range of 1.00x to 2.00x. Interest cover (covenant basis) increased to 12.50x from 6.30x, indicating strong ability to cover interest expenses. The aggregate pension deficit on a technical provision basis reduced to c.£200.00 million from c.£400.00 million. These metrics suggest a robust financial position with low risk. | In 2023, financial risk was moderate but improving. Net debt/EBITDA (covenant basis) was 1.50x, within the target range, but impacted by the Type 31 loss. Interest cover (covenant basis) was 6.30x, indicating adequate debt servicing capacity. The aggregate pension deficit on a technical provision basis was c.£400.00 million. The company's reliance on a single external customer for a significant portion of revenue (54.00% of FY23 revenue) presents a concentration risk. |
| Future financial performance projection | The outlook for 2024 is positive, with expectations of continued sustainable growth and improving margins. The company targets mid-single digit average annual organic revenue growth, underlying operating margins of at least 8.00%, and underlying operating cash conversion of at least 80.00%. The strengthened balance sheet, reduced pension deficit, and improved operational performance provide a solid foundation for achieving these medium-term targets. | The outlook for 2023 was focused on stabilization and operational improvement. The company aimed to manage exposure to historically onerous contracts and replace them with higher-quality orders. The completion of the portfolio alignment program and strengthening of the balance sheet were key achievements. The company expected to reinstate a dividend in FY24, signaling confidence in future performance. |

| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The report acknowledges that the geopolitical environment is increasingly unstable, leading to unpredictable crises and evolving threats. While this drives increased defense budgets, it also creates volatility in domestic and global markets, potentially increasing commodity prices, disrupting supply chains, and increasing cyber threats. The company's Type 31 contract has seen increased costs due to labor market inflation. | The report highlights that the macro-economic environment remains volatile, with extreme inflationary pressures beginning to recede slowly. Inflation, particularly rising labor costs, is a significant exposure for Babcock, especially in fixed-price contracts. The company aims to offset unrecoverable increases through targeted efficiencies. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces. | The report notes that while defense budgets are increasing, the growth in military demand is not yet matched, making Babcock's ability to affordably add value essential. The company faces challenges in securing contracts in new markets due to a preference for, or state funding of, domestic suppliers, and the need to align with customer expectations. | The report indicates that the market for Babcock's services is highly competitive, with customers often wielding significant bargaining power and requiring suppliers to assume substantial risk. Competition is strong in Australia, and France has well-established domestic defense suppliers, which could limit Babcock's opportunities. |
