# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Perspective | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | **Revenue Growth:** Net sales for fiscal 2024 increased by 4.48% to $159,514.00 million, compared to a decrease of 3.01% in fiscal 2023 to $152,669.00 million. The increase in 2024 was primarily driven by the acquisition of SRS, which contributed $6,406.00 million, and an additional week in the fiscal year, contributing approximately $2,500.00 million. In contrast, the decrease in 2023 was due to a negative comparable sales environment, particularly a decrease in comparable customer transactions and lumber price deflation. <br><br> **Gross Margin:** The gross profit margin remained stable at 33.40% in fiscal 2024, consistent with fiscal 2023. This stability in 2024 was attributed to lower transportation costs and reduced shrink within the Primary segment, offset by the inclusion of SRS. In fiscal 2023, the slight decrease from 33.50% in fiscal 2022 to 33.40% was due to price stabilization and inventory optimization, partially offset by lower supply chain costs. <br><br> **Revenue by Product/Service:** In fiscal 2024, net sales from products increased by 4.66% to $153,674.00 million, while net sales from services increased by 0.10% to $5,840.00 million. In fiscal 2023, net sales from products decreased by 3.27% to $146,835.00 million, and net sales from services increased by 4.20% to $5,834.00 million. The product sales growth in 2024 was significantly influenced by the SRS acquisition. <br><br> **Revenue by Geographic Region:** In fiscal 2024, U.S. net sales increased by 4.94% to $147,007.00 million, while net sales outside the U.S. decreased by 0.63% to $12,507.00 million. In fiscal 2023, U.S. net sales decreased by 3.28% to $140,083.00 million, and net sales outside the U.S. increased by 0.18% to $12,586.00 million. The U.S. sales growth in 2024 was bolstered by the SRS acquisition and the 53rd week. |
| Operating Efficiency | **Operating Expenses:** Total operating expenses increased by 8.57% to $31,782.00 million in fiscal 2024, compared to an increase of 1.85% to $29,271.00 million in fiscal 2023. <br><br> **Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A):** SG&A expenses increased by 8.05% to $28,748.00 million in fiscal 2024, rising from 17.40% of net sales in 2023 to 18.00% in 2024. This increase was primarily due to higher payroll costs, deleverage from a negative comparable sales environment, and lower legal-related benefits. In fiscal 2023, SG&A increased by 1.19% to $26,598.00 million, representing 17.40% of net sales, up from 16.70% in 2022, mainly due to wage investments and deleverage from negative comparable sales, partially offset by a one-time legal settlement benefit and lower incentive compensation. <br><br> **Depreciation and Amortization:** Depreciation and amortization increased by 13.51% to $3,034.00 million in fiscal 2024, representing 1.90% of net sales, up from 1.80% in 2023. This was driven by increased intangible asset amortization from the SRS acquisition ($218.00 million) and ongoing business investments. In fiscal 2023, it increased by 8.88% to $2,673.00 million, representing 1.80% of net sales, up from 1.60% in 2022, due to increased depreciation from business investments and deleverage from negative comparable sales. <br><br> **Operating Income:** Operating income decreased by 0.75% to $21,526.00 million in fiscal 2024, resulting in an operating margin of 13.50%, down from 14.20% in 2023. In fiscal 2023, operating income decreased by 9.78% to $21,689.00 million, with an operating margin of 14.20%, down from 15.30% in 2022. The decline in operating income and margin in both years reflects the impact of increased operating expenses relative to net sales growth. |
| External & One-Off Impact | **Effective Tax Rate:** The combined effective income tax rate decreased slightly from 24.00% in fiscal 2023 to 23.70% in fiscal 2024. In fiscal 2023, the rate was 24.00%, a minor increase from 23.90% in fiscal 2022. The 2024 decrease contributed positively to net earnings. <br><br> **Non-Recurring Items:** In fiscal 2024, the 53rd week added approximately $2,500.00 million to net sales and increased diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.30. The SRS acquisition, completed in June 2024, contributed $6,406.00 million in net sales. In fiscal 2023, there was a one-time benefit from the favorable settlement of litigation with a vendor, which partially offset higher SG&A expenses. The 2022 Tax Act, enacted in August 2022, had no material impact on the effective tax rate in 2023. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | The Home Depot faces intense competition from various retailers, including traditional brick-and-mortar, multichannel, and online players, leading to potential adverse effects on prices, margins, and market share. The internet facilitates competitive entry, price transparency, and comparison shopping, increasing competitive pressures. Failure to adapt to evolving customer needs, expectations, and technological developments, such as personalized experiences and rapid delivery options, could negatively impact customer relationships, demand, and market share. Macroeconomic conditions, including high interest rates and inflation, continue to pressure home improvement demand, particularly for larger remodeling projects. The company's ability to manage commodity price volatility and pass on costs to customers is limited by the competitive environment. | The Home Depot faces strong competition from various retailers, including traditional brick-and-mortar, multichannel, and online players, which could adversely affect prices, demand, and market share. The internet increases competitive entry, price transparency, and comparison shopping. Failure to identify and respond to evolving customer needs, expectations, and technological trends, such as personalized experiences and rapid delivery options, could negatively impact customer relationships, demand, and market share. Macroeconomic conditions, including a rising interest rate environment and shifts in consumer spending from goods to services, are pressuring home improvement demand. Inflation and deflation of commodity prices can affect pricing strategies, demand, and profit margins. |
| Operational Risks | The company's success depends on attracting, developing, and retaining highly qualified associates while controlling labor costs, which are influenced by market pressures, legislation, and competition. Failure of key information technology systems or processes, including those managed by third-party providers, could disrupt operations, impair data security, and damage reputation. Disruptions in the supply chain due to natural disasters, trade disputes, labor shortages, or other factors could affect inventory availability, increase costs, and harm reputation. Maintaining a safe and secure shopping and working environment is critical, with increased shrink from organized retail crime posing challenges and potentially increasing costs and impacting customer/associate experience. | The company's ability to attract, develop, and retain qualified associates while controlling labor costs is crucial, with challenges arising from market pressures, labor laws, and competition.
