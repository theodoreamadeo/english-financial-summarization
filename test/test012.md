# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Perspective | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue for Gas Malaysia decreased slightly by 0.42% from RM8,078.92 million in 2023 to RM8,044.88 million in 2024. This decline was primarily attributed to lower average selling prices of natural gas, despite an 8.60% increase in natural gas sales volume. The gross margin improved from 7.35% in 2023 to 8.58% in 2024, indicating better cost management relative to revenue. Revenue from the sale of natural gas and CNG decreased from RM7,936.16 million in 2023 to RM7,848.26 million in 2024, while LPG sales increased from RM29.98 million to RM33.74 million. Revenue from tolling services saw a significant increase from RM101.65 million in 2023 to RM149.77 million in 2024. Revenue from metered services also increased from RM11.13 million to RM11.87 million. There was a cash contribution for pipeline construction of RM1.25 million in 2024, compared to none in 2023. No specific geographic revenue distribution data was provided. |
| Operating Efficiency | The company's operating efficiency improved in 2024. Operating expenses (administrative and selling & distribution) increased from RM91.20 million in 2023 to RM113.70 million in 2024, representing a 24.67% increase. Despite this, profit from operations increased by 15.00% from RM506.62 million in 2023 to RM582.47 million in 2024. The operating margin improved from 6.27% in 2023 to 7.24% in 2024, indicating that the increase in operating expenses was outpaced by the growth in gross profit and other operating income. This suggests effective cost management relative to the overall business scale and revenue generation. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate for the Group decreased from 25.40% in 2023 to 25.01% in 2024. This slight decrease contributed positively to the net profit. In 2023, the tax expense was RM131.71 million on a profit before zakat and taxation of RM518.61 million. In 2024, the tax expense increased to RM148.37 million on a profit before zakat and taxation of RM593.26 million. The 2023 tax expense was lower due to the impact of Cukai Makmur in 2022, which did not recur in 2023. There were no other explicitly stated non-recurring items significantly affecting profitability in either year, apart from the tax effects. |

Total liabilities increased by 17.89%. The current ratio of 0.96, while improved, still suggests that current assets are slightly less than current liabilities, warranting careful liquidity management. | The gearing ratio increased to 19.60% from 16.10%, reflecting increased debt to finance capital expenditure.
