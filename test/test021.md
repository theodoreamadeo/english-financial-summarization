# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Perspective | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue decreased by 3.00% from $474.30 million in 2023 to $460.20 million in 2024. This follows a significant 21.90% decrease in 2023 from $607.50 million in 2022. The decline in 2024 was primarily due to ongoing challenging market conditions, particularly in the telecom sector, which impacted the Lifecycle Service Assurance segment. This segment saw a revenue decrease of 9.00% from $199.10 million in 2023 to $181.00 million in 2024. In contrast, the Networks & Security segment experienced a 2.00% revenue increase from $275.20 million in 2023 to $279.20 million in 2024, driven by strong performance in High-Speed Ethernet products and Positioning. <br><br>Gross margin remained robust at 72.00% in 2024, a slight decrease from 72.40% in 2023. This stability was attributed to effective supply chain management and robust customer pricing. The Lifecycle Service Assurance segment's gross margin slightly decreased from 74.20% in 2023 to 73.60% in 2024, while the Networks & Security segment's gross margin remained stable at 71.00% in 2024 compared to 71.10% in 2023. <br><br>Geographically, revenue in the Americas saw a 1.94% increase from $268.10 million in 2023 to $273.30 million in 2024. EMEA experienced a significant 15.87% growth from $52.30 million in 2023 to $60.60 million in 2024. However, Asia Pacific revenue declined by 17.93% from $153.90 million in 2023 to $126.30 million in 2024, primarily due to macroeconomic factors in China. |
| Operating Efficiency | Adjusted operating profit increased by 2.21% from $45.20 million in 2023 to $46.20 million in 2024. This led to an improvement in the adjusted operating margin from 9.50% in 2023 to 10.00% in 2024. This improvement was driven by improved trading conditions in the latter part of 2024 and continued focus on cost control. <br><br>Product development costs decreased by 3.32% from $102.40 million in 2023 to $99.00 million in 2024, benefiting from the transfer of North American activities to lower-cost regions. Selling and marketing costs also decreased by 5.68% from $133.90 million in 2023 to $126.30 million in 2024, due to a successful reorganisation of the EMEA sales model. Administration costs, however, increased significantly in reported terms from $88.90 million in 2023 to $95.90 million in 2024, primarily due to $18.20 million in acquisition-related transaction costs in 2024. <br><br>Reported operating profit decreased by 44.02% from $18.40 million in 2023 to $10.30 million in 2024, largely due to the increase in adjusting items, particularly the acquisition-related costs. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate remained relatively stable, decreasing slightly from 10.80% in 2023 to 10.70% in 2024. This rate continues to benefit from the UK Patent Box Scheme, US R&D Tax Credit, and US foreign-derived intangible income deduction. <br><br>Non-recurring items significantly impacted reported profitability. Total adjusting items increased from $26.80 million in 2023 to $35.90 million in 2024. The most substantial increase was in acquisition-related costs, which surged from $0.70 million in 2023 to $18.60 million in 2024, primarily due to professional advisory charges related to the Keysight acquisition offer. Restructuring costs decreased significantly from $13.50 million in 2023 to $2.50 million in 2024, as the R&D engineering plan concluded and finance transformation initiatives progressed. Share-based payment expenses treated as adjusting items increased from $7.60 million in 2023 to $9.60 million in 2024. These adjusting items caused reported profit before tax to decrease by 39.74% from $22.90 million in 2023 to $13.80 million in 2024, despite a slight increase in adjusted operating profit. |

| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Risk assessment procedures | The risk assessment process starts in the businesses, where risk registers are maintained as part of the normal operating and control procedures, and is facilitated by the Head of Risk & Internal Audit. Each business identifies its key risks and mitigating factors and nominates a risk owner. The impact and the likelihood of occurrence of each risk is ranked, which assists the Group Executive Committee in assessing the likely impact in aggregate of each risk to the Group as a whole. The company also conducts horizon-scanning to maintain a medium and longer-term view of potential disruptors or emerging risks to its business. The individual businesses are required to update their risk registers regularly to reflect new or emerging risks as they are identified to keep them up to date. These new or emerging risks are monitored and assessed as part of the risk assessment process and are escalated to the Group Executive Committee for further review as required. The approach includes a process to identify, clarify and communicate emerging risks for Board discussion and assessment, along with agreed mitigating action plans. | The risk assessment process starts in the businesses, where risk registers are maintained as part of the normal operating and control procedures, and is facilitated by the Head of Risk & Internal Audit.

The cash position at Group and operational level is monitored constantly and variances from expected levels are investigated thoroughly. Clearly defined guidelines have been established for capital expenditure and investment decisions. These include the preparation of budgets, appraisal and review procedures, and delegated authority levels. | All businesses prepare annual operating plans and budgets which are supplemented by regular forecasts throughout the year.
