# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Perspective | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Centene Corporation's total revenues increased by 6.00% from $153,999.00 million in 2023 to $163,071.00 million in 2024. This growth was primarily driven by a 4.00% increase in premium and service revenues, from $140,095.00 million in 2023 to $145,505.00 million in 2024, and a 26.00% increase in premium tax revenue, from $13,904.00 million to $17,566.00 million. The increase in premium and service revenues was mainly attributed to membership growth in the Marketplace business due to strong product positioning and overall market growth, as well as outperformance in Marketplace risk adjustment for the 2023 benefit year. Medicaid rate increases also contributed to this growth. However, service revenues decreased by 28.00% from $4,459.00 million in 2023 to $3,202.00 million in 2024, and total revenues were partially offset by lower Medicaid membership due to redeterminations and divestitures in the Other segment. The gross margin decreased by 3.22% from $17,637.00 million in 2023 to $17,069.00 million in 2024. This decline was primarily due to lower overall Medicaid membership and higher acuity post-redeterminations, as well as lower Medicare Advantage revenue due to Star quality ratings impact and lower membership. The decrease in the Other segment's gross margin by 48.64% from $1,100.00 million to $565.00 million was primarily due to divestitures. Conversely, the Commercial segment's gross margin increased significantly by 52.39% from $5,029.00 million to $7,663.00 million, driven by membership growth and improved margins. |
| Operating Efficiency | Centene Corporation's operating efficiency showed mixed trends. Total operating expenses increased by 5.84% from $151,069.00 million in 2023 to $159,896.00 million in 2024. Medical costs increased by 5.73% from $118,894.00 million to $125,707.00 million, and premium tax expense increased by 25.10% from $14,226.00 million to $17,806.00 million. However, cost of services decreased by 23.43% from $3,564.00 million to $2,729.00 million, primarily due to the divestiture of Circle Health, which operated at a lower cost of service ratio. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased slightly by 1.30% from $12,563.00 million to $12,400.00 million. The SG&A expense ratio improved from 9.00% in 2023 to 8.50% in 2024, and the adjusted SG&A expense ratio also decreased from 8.90% to 8.50%. This improvement was mainly driven by the divestiture of Circle Health, lower Medicare SG&A, and leveraging expenses over higher revenues, partially offset by growth in the Marketplace business which has a higher SG&A expense ratio. Earnings from operations increased by 8.36% from $2,930.00 million in 2023 to $3,175.00 million in 2024, indicating an improvement in core operational performance despite the increase in total operating expenses. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate for Centene Corporation decreased from 25.00% in 2023 to 22.60% in 2024. The 2024 effective tax rate reflects tax effects of the Circle Health divestiture, settlements with tax authorities, and valuation allowance releases. The 2023 effective tax rate reflected the tax effects of the distribution of long-term stock awards to the estate of the Company's former CEO, divestiture gains and losses, lower state taxes, and the pending divestiture of Circle Health. Non-recurring items significantly impacted profitability in both years. In 2024, impairment charges were $13.00 million, a 97.54% decrease from $529.00 million in 2023. The 2024 impairment was driven by Health Net Federal Services asset impairment related to the TRICARE Managed Care Support Contract. In 2023, impairment charges included $292.00 million related to Circle Health, $140.00 million related to Operose Health, and $97.00 million related to real estate optimization. Investment and other income increased by 28.07% from $1,393.00 million in 2023 to $1,784.00 million in 2024, driven by higher interest rates on larger investment balances and net gains on divestitures in 2024. The 2023 figure also included net gains on divestitures, partially offset by a realized loss on the sale of investments. |

The debt-to-capital ratio increased to 41.20% in 2024 from 40.70% in 2023, primarily due to stock repurchases and increased borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, partially offset by net earnings. | Centene's comprehensive financial health in 2023 showed total assets of $84,641.00 million and total liabilities of $58,685.00 million. Stockholders' equity was $25,937.00 million. The current ratio was 1.11 ($40,756.00 million / $36,716.00 million), indicating adequate short-term liquidity. The debt-to-capital ratio was 40.70%, a decrease from 42.70% in 2022, driven by net earnings and other comprehensive earnings, partially offset by stock repurchases. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Net earnings attributable to Centene Corporation increased by 22.32% to $3,305.00 million in 2024 from $2,702.00 million in 2023. Diluted EPS increased by 27.47% to $6.31 in 2024 from $4.95 in 2023. The net profit margin (net earnings / total revenues) improved to 2.03% in 2024 from 1.75% in 2023.

The effective tax rate decreased to 22.60% in 2024 from 25.00% in 2023, contributing positively to net earnings. | Net earnings attributable to Centene Corporation were $2,702.00 million in 2023, a significant increase from $1,202.00 million in 2022. Diluted EPS was $4.95 in 2023, up from $2.07 in 2022. The net profit margin was 1.75% in 2023. Return on assets was 3.19% in 2023. Return on equity was 10.42% in 2023. The effective tax rate was 25.00% in 2023. |
| Operational efficiency | The Health Benefits Ratio (HBR) increased to 88.30% in 2024 from 87.70% in 2023, indicating a slight decrease in medical cost efficiency relative to premium revenues. This was primarily due to higher acuity in Medicaid post-redeterminations and Medicare Star rating impacts, partially offset by Marketplace membership growth and improved margins. The SG&A expense ratio improved to 8.50% in 2024 from 9.00% in 2023, reflecting better cost management and leveraging expenses over higher revenues. Operating margin (earnings from operations / total revenues) was 1.95% in 2024, a slight increase from 1.90% in 2023. | The Health Benefits Ratio (HBR) remained stable at 87.70% in 2023, consistent with 2022. The SG&A expense ratio increased to 9.00% in 2023 from 8.60% in 2022, driven by Marketplace business growth and Medicare distribution costs, partially offset by SG&A reduction initiatives. Operating margin was 1.90% in 2023. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | The debt-to-capital ratio increased to 41.20% in 2024 from 40.70% in 2023, indicating a slightly higher reliance on debt. Operating cash flows significantly decreased to $154.00 million in 2024 from $8,053.00 million in 2023, primarily due to an increase in pharmacy receivables and a decrease in net risk adjustment payables. This substantial drop in operating cash flow is a key early warning signal for liquidity, despite the company's statement of having sufficient liquidity for the next 12 months. The company's investment portfolio is subject to interest rate risk, with a hypothetical 1% increase in rates potentially decreasing fair value by $665.00 million. | The debt-to-capital ratio decreased to 40.70% in 2023 from 42.70% in 2022, indicating improved financial leverage. Operating cash flows were strong at $8,053.00 million in 2023, providing ample liquidity. The company's investment portfolio was subject to interest rate risk, with a hypothetical 1% increase in rates potentially decreasing fair value by $630.00 million. |
| Future financial performance projection | Centene projects net dividends of approximately $1,900.00 million from regulated subsidiaries and capital expenditures of approximately $700.00 million in 2025. The company expects to continue targeting initiatives to improve productivity, efficiencies, and reduce organizational costs. The significant decrease in operating cash flow in 2024 ($154.00 million) compared to 2023 ($8,053.00 million) is a concern for future liquidity and may impact the ability to fund operations and stock repurchases without increased borrowings. The company's ability to navigate Medicaid redeterminations and Medicare Star ratings will be crucial. | Centene expected to receive net dividends of approximately $3,000.00 million from regulated subsidiaries and spend approximately $640.00 million in capital expenditures in 2024. The company aimed to improve productivity, efficiencies, and reduce organizational costs. The strong operating cash flow in 2023 ($8,053.00 million) provided a solid foundation for future investments and shareholder returns. |

| Business Model | Centene Corporation operates a managed healthcare business model, primarily serving government-sponsored and commercial healthcare programs. The company generates revenue through fixed monthly premiums per member from states and CMS for Medicaid and Medicare products, and from members of commercial health plans. Its target customer segments include under-insured and uninsured individuals, focusing on low-income and complex populations. Unique aspects include a "local approach" with local brands and teams, fully integrated services, and a commitment to sustainable partnerships with community organizations and providers. The business model emphasizes value-based arrangements with providers to improve health outcomes and reduce costs, rather than owning providers. | Centene Corporation operates a managed healthcare business model, primarily through government-sponsored programs (Medicaid, Medicare, Health Insurance Marketplace) and commercial health insurance products.

The company is a market leader in Medicaid, Marketplace, and Medicare PDP, and a significant player in Medicare Advantage, focusing on lower-income, complex members.

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## 4.1 Risk Factors

### 4.1.1. Market Risks

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---------- | :---------- | :---------- |
| Competition | The company operates in a highly competitive environment with other MCOs, specialty companies, and non-traditional competitors. Factors like quality of care, comprehensive provider networks, financial stability, and local investments influence contract awards. Competition for members is based on benefit plans, provider network size and quality, service quality, and reputation. Consolidation in the managed care industry and complementary industries (hospital, physician, pharmaceutical, medical device, health information systems) can intensify competition, affecting the ability to retain members and providers, revenue growth, pricing flexibility, and control over medical cost trends. Failure to adapt to industry changes, including new market entrants and technological innovations like AI/ML, could negatively impact competitive position. | The company operates in a highly competitive environment with other MCOs, specialty companies, and non-traditional competitors.

Failure to adapt to industry changes, including new market entrants, could negatively impact competitive position. |
| Market Demand | The ability to accurately anticipate demand for Health Insurance Marketplace and Medicare Advantage products is crucial, as demand depends on factors outside the company's control, such as bid competitiveness, broker distribution channels, and competitor entry/exit. Higher-than-anticipated demand could lead to inadequate staffing and negatively impact quality scores and relationships with members, providers, and regulators. | The ability to accurately anticipate demand for Health Insurance Marketplace and Medicare Advantage products is crucial, as demand depends on factors outside the company's control, such as bid competitiveness, broker distribution channels, and competitor entry/exit.

| Economic Conditions | General economic conditions, including interest rates, inflation, and unemployment levels, are beyond the company's control and can reduce the ability to accurately predict and control health benefit costs. Adverse economic conditions can pressure state budgets, leading to reduced funding, benefit contraction, and limited or no premium rate increases for government-sponsored programs. | General economic conditions, including interest rates, inflation, and unemployment levels, are beyond the company's control and can reduce the ability to accurately predict and control health benefit costs.

| Political Factors | Changes in U.S. presidential administrations or Congress can lead to changes in federal or state laws or regulations, including those related to income tax reform or government healthcare programs (e.g., ACA, enhanced advance premium tax credits).

| Regulatory Changes | Changes in federal or state laws or regulations, including those related to the ACA and government healthcare programs, can significantly impact the business.
