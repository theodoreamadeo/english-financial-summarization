# Section 4: Risk Factors

## 4.1 Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | The company faces market risks from a dynamic and challenging global landscape, including global economic uncertainties, inflationary pressures, and geopolitical tensions. These factors create a volatile business environment, impacting demand for services in the semiconductor and oil & gas industries. The semiconductor industry experienced a record-breaking year in 2024, with total sales reaching US$627.6 billion, a 19.1% increase from 2023. However, the increasing complexity of semiconductor manufacturing and the rising need for electronics lead to higher demand for advanced precision cleaning services. The oil & gas sector's recovery and increased repair and maintenance activities provide growth opportunities, but oil prices remain volatile due to fluctuating market conditions, shifting demand, and geopolitical tensions. | The company faces market risks primarily from the overall weakness in global demand in the front-end semiconductor industry, particularly in the first half of 2023. The global semiconductor industry sales totaled US$526.8 billion in 2023, an 8.2% decrease compared to 2022. This slowdown impacted demand for semiconductor services, leading to a slight decrease in overall revenue. The oil & gas industry experienced significant volatility due to global geopolitical tensions and the COVID-19 pandemic, which plunged crude oil prices. However, the business gradually gained momentum in 2022 and 2023 due to improved activities in this segment. |
| Operational Risks | Operational risks include supply chain disruptions and rising costs, which posed hurdles in 2024. The fire incident at the Kulim facility in May 2024 disrupted operations, leading to additional costs for shipping, handling, and operational adjustments, which placed pressure on profit margins. The competitive labor market in Singapore remains a key concern, as recruiting and retaining skilled professionals in the semiconductor sector is increasingly difficult. The company mitigates these risks through workforce optimization, automation, and continuous improvement of operational efficiency. | Operational risks include ongoing disruptions in supply chains, exacerbated by geopolitical tensions and natural disasters. The labor market remains tight, making it challenging to attract and retain top talent. The company also faces challenges in managing rising manpower and material costs, particularly in Singapore, and a limited pool of local talent. To mitigate these, the company renegotiated contracts to adjust prices, streamlined its workforce, optimized processes, and initiated continuous improvement projects. |
| Financial Risks | Financial risks include managing rising operational costs, which led to renegotiating contracts to realign pricing for specific parts in Singapore. The fire incident at the Kulim facility resulted in additional costs, impacting profit margins, despite a net insurance claim of RM2.2 million. The Group's total cash balance remained strong at RM514.9 million, and shareholders' fund improved by 12% to RM720.6 million. Total assets increased by 12% to RM988.5 million, primarily due to increases in cash and bank balances and trade receivables. Liabilities increased by RM18.1 million to RM215.6 million, mainly from trade and other payables. | Financial risks include a decrease in revenue and profit before tax due to slower demand from the semiconductor industry and higher withholding tax on dividends from the Taiwan subsidiary. The Group's profit after tax decreased by 8% compared to the previous year. Despite these challenges, the Group generated a positive cash flow of RM144.0 million from operations, and its total cash balance remained strong at RM417.0 million. The Group's total assets increased by 10% to RM885.4 million, and shareholders' fund improved by 17% to RM641.2 million. Liabilities decreased by RM20.4 million due to the repayment of a money market loan. |
| Compliance Risks | Compliance risks involve upholding the principles outlined in the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance, ensuring ethical business practices and transparency. The company is committed to fostering strong relationships with stakeholders and safeguarding shareholders' rights. It has established a robust governance framework, including policies and best practices aligned with corporate values and sustainability objectives. The company also engages proactively with suppliers, customers, and stakeholders to uphold ESG principles, ensuring transparency, competitiveness, and ethical decision-making throughout the supply chain. The company benchmarks its progress against internationally recognized frameworks such as GRI, UN SDGs, RBA, and FTSE Russell ESG Model Framework. | Compliance risks involve adhering to laws and regulations, upholding high ethical standards, and integrating sustainability into the overall development strategy.
