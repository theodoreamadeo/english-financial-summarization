# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Perspective | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | The company's revenue experienced a decline from RM97,933,052.00 in the 6-month period of 2023 to RM170,717,663.00 in the 12-month period of 2024. This is not a direct year-over-year comparison due to a change in the financial year-end. However, when comparing the 2023 6-month period to the 2024 12-month period, the revenue increased by 74.32%. The gross profit margin decreased from 34.50% in 2023 to 28.70% in 2024. This indicates that while revenue increased, the direct costs associated with generating that revenue grew at a faster rate or the pricing power decreased. The primary source of revenue for the Group in both periods was construction contracts, accounting for 100.00% of the Group's revenue. There is no specific breakdown of revenue by product/service or geographic region beyond the overall construction segment in Malaysia. |
| Operating Efficiency | The company's operating efficiency, as indicated by the Profit Before Tax (PBT) margin, decreased from 33.30% in 2023 to 24.30% in 2024. This suggests a reduction in overall profitability relative to revenue. Administrative expenses increased from RM4,477,720.00 in 2023 (6 months) to RM8,641,458.00 in 2024 (12 months). While this is an increase in absolute terms, it is difficult to directly compare the efficiency due to the change in reporting periods. However, the PBT margin decline indicates that the growth in revenue was not fully translated into proportional growth in operating profit, possibly due to increased operating costs or other factors impacting profitability. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate for the Group increased from 22.32% in 2023 to 24.17% in 2024. This indicates a higher proportion of profit being paid as tax in 2024 compared to 2023. In 2023, the Group benefited from a "Waiver of debts received" amounting to RM1,794,479.00, which was a non-recurring item that positively impacted profitability. There were no such significant non-recurring positive items identified in 2024. The 2023 period also saw a "Fair value gain on short-term deposits" of RM1,280,548.00, which was RM1,281,385.00 in 2024. |

## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Operational efficiency | The Gross Profit (GP) margin decreased from 34.50% in 2023 to 28.70% in 2024, indicating a reduction in the profitability of core construction activities. Administrative expenses increased in absolute terms, but a direct efficiency comparison is difficult due to the change in reporting periods. The asset-light model is cited as contributing to healthy profit margins due to low depreciation charges and cost efficiencies. | The Gross Profit (GP) margin was 34.50%. The asset-light model was highlighted as a key factor in maintaining healthy profit margins, with low depreciation charges and cost efficiencies. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Total liabilities increased significantly by 65.92%, driven by higher trade payables and borrowings. Borrowings increased from RM4,995,142.00 to RM14,346,730.00. While the Group maintains a net cash position, the increase in liabilities warrants monitoring. Credit risk is managed through credit verification procedures and ageing analysis for trade receivables. Liquidity risk is managed by maintaining adequate cash and diverse credit facilities. Interest rate risk is present due to variable rate borrowings. | Total liabilities were RM48,510,055.00, with borrowings of RM4,995,142.00. The current ratio was 3.90 times, indicating strong short-term liquidity. Credit risk was managed through credit verification and monitoring of trade receivables. Liquidity risk was mitigated by a strong cash position. Interest rate risk was present due to variable rate borrowings. |
| Future financial performance projection | The Group is optimistic about future prospects, backed by progressive growth in construction management services and expected expansion in the M&E division through the acquisition of SJEE. New contracts secured, such as the RM618.20 million PV 22 Residences main building works and a RM315.00 million turnkey contract in July 2024, provide clear earnings visibility for the next 3 to 4 years. The data center boom in Malaysia is expected to significantly benefit SJEE, with a secured RM73.50 million electrical works contract and a tender book of approximately RM450.00 million. | The Group was positive about its prospects, supported by ongoing projects and potential new contracts. The order book of RM602.70 million provided earnings visibility for the next three to four years. The venture into robotic construction technologies and IBS was expected to enhance productivity and broaden revenue streams. The government's focus on infrastructure and affordable housing projects was seen as a growth driver. |

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The report acknowledges potential slowdowns in global and Malaysian economies, which could dampen demand for construction services. Challenges include high interest rates and a rising cost environment, impacting building material costs due to supply chain issues and inflationary pressures. The Group mitigates this by optimizing subcontractor selection, leveraging bulk purchasing, and implementing tight budget controls. | The World Bank cautioned that lagged effects of monetary tightening and restrictive credit conditions are expected to weigh on global economic activities in H2 2023, with weakness persisting into 2024. This poses a significant risk to the demand for Southern Score Builders' services, as construction activities are sensitive to subdued market sentiment, potentially leading to reduced investments in public infrastructure and property development. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces. | The construction industry is highly competitive, with established players and new entrants vying for projects. SSBB differentiates itself through its proven track record, extensive client base, experienced management team, and commitment to technological advancements. The Group aims to maintain its competitive edge by staying abreast of the latest construction technologies and adopting best practices. | Southern Score Builders operates in a highly competitive environment, facing competition from existing business rivals offering similar services (building construction, infrastructure, foundation & geotechnics, IBS) and new market entrants. The Group aims to differentiate itself through its established track record, large customer base, experienced management, and strength in technology adoption, particularly by implementing the latest IBS and construction technology. |
