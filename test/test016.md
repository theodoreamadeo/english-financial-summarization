# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | In 2024, the company's total revenue increased by 40.00% to $1,295.50 million from $925.50 million in 2023. This growth was primarily driven by a significant 637.00% increase in nickel refining revenue, reaching $738.10 million in 2024, compared to $100.10 million in 2023. Nickel refining's contribution to total revenue surged to 57.00% in 2024 from 10.82% in 2023. Conversely, coal sales revenue decreased by 33.40% to $542.90 million in 2024 from $814.70 million in 2023, mainly due to a 20.60% drop in average selling price and a 6.10% decrease in sales volume. The gross profit margin declined significantly from 41.30% in 2023 to 21.90% in 2024, despite the overall revenue growth. Geographically, local sales increased by 36.80% to $198.10 million in 2024, while export sales grew by 40.60% to $1,097.30 million, with East Asia remaining the largest export market. |
| Operating Efficiency | The company's operating efficiency declined in 2024, with the operating profit margin decreasing to 16.60% from 31.00% in 2023. Operating profit fell from $286.90 million in 2023 to $215.40 million in 2024. This was largely influenced by a substantial 86.30% increase in the cost of revenues and direct costs, which rose to $1,012.10 million in 2024 from $543.10 million in 2023. This increase in costs outpaced revenue growth, leading to the contraction in operating margins. Selling expenses, however, decreased by 53.10% to $20.40 million in 2024, primarily due to a reversal of estimated domestic market obligation shortfall. General and administrative expenses also saw an 8.60% decrease to $47.60 million in 2024. Despite these reductions in selling and administrative costs, the significant rise in direct costs associated with increased nickel production negatively impacted overall operating efficiency. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 25.60% in 2023 to 32.53% in 2024. This change indicates a higher proportion of pre-tax profit being allocated to income tax expense. Non-recurring items significantly impacted profitability in both years. In 2024, the company recorded a substantial impairment loss of $45.93 million on its investment in an associate (NIC) and a decrease in the fair value of investment in an associate before obtaining control of $30.72 million. These items contributed to a total of $80.02 million in other expenses. In 2023, other expenses were $70.05 million, primarily driven by a $68.95 million decrease in the fair value of investment in an associate before obtaining control. Additionally, 2023 benefited from a $3.65 million gain on bargain purchase from the IMI acquisition, which was a one-off positive impact. The fluctuating effective tax rate and the presence of significant non-recurring gains and losses highlight the volatility in the company's reported profitability. |

## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | Total assets increased by 57.60% to $2,574.50 million, driven by a 66.10% rise in non-current assets, primarily from fixed assets, advances for fixed asset purchases, and goodwill due to business combinations (WMI and BSE acquisitions). Total liabilities grew by 72.80% to $791.90 million, with non-current liabilities surging by 138.90% due to increased bank loans and non-controlling interest payables. Total equity increased by 51.80% to $1,782.70 million, with a significant 207.30% increase in non-controlling interests. The current ratio improved to 1.90x from 1.70x, indicating better short-term liquidity. | Total assets increased by 27.70% to $1,633.10 million, mainly due to a 58.10% increase in non-current assets, including fixed assets and other receivables (financing for PT Blue Sparking Energy). Total liabilities grew by 60.00% to $458.40 million, with non-current liabilities rising by 231.40% due to long-term bank loans. Total equity increased by 18.40% to $1,174.70 million. The current ratio decreased to 1.70x from 2.30x, indicating a slight weakening in short-term liquidity. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profit for the year decreased by 60.30% to $77.70 million, and net profit attributable to owners of the parent decreased by 64.20% to $54.10 million. Gross profit margin fell to 21.90% from 41.30%, and operating profit margin declined to 16.60% from 31.00%. EBITDA margin also decreased to 21.80% from 37.00%. The decline in profitability was largely due to an 86.30% increase in cost of revenues and direct costs, outpacing the 40.00% revenue growth. Significant non-recurring items, such as impairment losses on investments, further impacted earnings quality. | Profit for the year decreased by 48.50% to $195.70 million, and net profit attributable to owners of the parent decreased by 49.90% to $151.00 million. Gross profit margin fell to 41.30% from 59.90%, and operating profit margin declined to 31.00% from 48.70%. EBITDA margin also decreased to 37.00% from 52.20%. The decline was primarily due to a 49.60% increase in cost of revenues and direct costs, despite a 2.30% increase in total revenue. A $3.65 million gain on bargain purchase from the IMI acquisition positively impacted earnings quality. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency deteriorated in 2024. The operating profit margin decreased to 16.60% from 31.00% in 2023. Cost of revenues and direct costs increased by 86.30%, significantly outpacing the 40.00% revenue growth. This indicates challenges in cost management, particularly with the expansion into nickel refining. Selling expenses decreased by 53.10%, and general and administrative expenses decreased by 8.60%, suggesting some control over indirect costs. However, the overall efficiency was hampered by higher direct costs. | Operational efficiency declined in 2023. The operating profit margin decreased to 31.00% from 48.70% in 2022. Cost of revenues and direct costs increased by 49.60%, while total revenue only grew by 2.30%. This indicates a significant increase in operational costs relative to revenue generation. Selling expenses decreased by 33.60%, partly due to lower domestic market obligation shortfall. General and administrative expenses increased by 45.00%, mainly due to higher taxes and licenses. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | The total liabilities to total assets ratio remained stable at 0.30x, while the total liabilities to total equity ratio increased to 0.90x from 0.50x, indicating higher leverage. The (Net Cash)/Net Debt to EBITDA ratio shifted from (0.10)x (net cash) in 2023 to 0.70x (net debt) in 2024, suggesting a move towards a net debt position. This indicates increased financial risk, possibly due to significant investments in nickel operations. The current ratio improved, but the shift to net debt warrants close monitoring of debt service capabilities. | The total liabilities to total assets ratio increased to 0.30x from 0.20x, and the total liabilities to total equity ratio remained stable at 0.40x. The (Net Cash)/Net Debt to EBITDA ratio was (0.10)x, indicating a net cash position. The current ratio decreased to 1.70x from 2.30x, suggesting a slight reduction in short-term liquidity. The average collection period for receivables increased to 36 days from 19 days, indicating a slower collection process. Overall, financial risk remained manageable but showed some signs of increasing leverage and slower cash conversion. |
| Future financial performance projection | The company projects coal production and sales volumes of 5.0-5.5 million tons for 2025, a decrease from 6.1 million tons produced and 6.0 million tons sold in 2024. Nickel production and sales volumes are projected to increase significantly to 1.8-2.5 million tons and 2.4-3.1 million tons (nickel tons), respectively, from 56,998 Ni tons produced and 57,583 Ni tons sold in 2024. Total revenue is projected to be $1,328-$1,481 million, an increase from $1,295.50 million in 2024. However, profit for the year is projected to be $19-$78 million, which is lower than $77.70 million in 2024. This suggests that while revenue is expected to grow, profitability might remain under pressure due to ongoing investments and operational costs in the nickel segment. | The company projects coal production and sales volumes of 5.5-6.1 million tons for 2024, an increase from 7.0 million tons produced and 7.1 million tons sold in 2023. Nickel production and sales volumes are projected to be 23,800-28,000 tons Ni (NPI) and 38,000-42,000 tons Ni (HG Nickel Matte). Total revenue is projected to be $1,280-$1,450 million, a significant increase from $925.50 million in 2023. Profit for the year is projected to be $110-$140 million, an increase from $195.70 million in 2023. This indicates an optimistic outlook for revenue and profit growth, driven by the expansion into nickel and continued coal operations. |

The report notes that these pressures are expected to continue in the short term, impacting the Company's revenue and profit margins. | The 2023 report highlights global economic uncertainty, including inflation, rising interest rates, weakening economies in developed countries, and geopolitical tensions.
