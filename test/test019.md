| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | In 2024, the company's revenue decreased by 39.70% to Rp 197,222,283,012.00 from Rp 327,048,654,911.00 in 2023. This decline was primarily driven by a 48.18% drop in sales from the Operating System & SIM Card segment, which fell from Rp 300,723,176,393.00 in 2023 to Rp 155,847,536,882.00 in 2024. Conversely, the Scratch Card segment saw a 6.73% increase in sales, from Rp 19,474,378,688.00 in 2023 to Rp 20,785,036,088.00 in 2024. The Fulfillment segment experienced significant growth of 308.53%, rising from Rp 4,215,299,830.00 in 2023 to Rp 17,220,716,042.00 in 2024.

The substantial drop in sales revenue overshadowed these cost reductions, leading to a lower operating profit margin. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate for the company changed from 22.73% in 2023 to 32.26% in 2024. This increase in the effective tax rate indicates a higher proportion of pre-tax profit being paid as tax. The company reported a net profit for the year of Rp 8,119,250,516.00 in 2024, a 34.02% decrease from Rp 12,306,322,915.00 in 2023.
