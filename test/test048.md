# Section 3: Business Analysis

## 3.1 Profitability Analysis

| Perspective | Answer |
| :---------- | :----- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue decreased from $78,586.00 million in 2023 to $82,671.00 million in 2024, representing a growth rate of 5.20%. This indicates a modest increase in overall sales. Cost of products sold increased from $60,541.00 million in 2023 to $61,975.00 million in 2024, a growth of 2.37%. Gross margin improved from $18,045.00 million in 2023 to $20,696.00 million in 2024, with the gross margin percentage increasing from 22.96% to 25.03%. This suggests better control over direct costs relative to revenue growth. Revenue distribution by product/service shows varied trends. Refined product sales decreased from $23,389.00 million in 2023 to $22,051.00 million in 2024 (-5.72%). Crude sales increased from $23,492.00 million in 2023 to $25,368.00 million in 2024 (8.00%). NGL sales increased from $15,957.00 million in 2023 to $19,105.00 million in 2024 (19.72%). Gathering, transportation, and other fees increased from $11,428.00 million in 2023 to $12,027.00 million in 2024 (5.24%). Natural gas sales decreased significantly from $3,259.00 million in 2023 to $2,737.00 million in 2024 (-15.99%). Other revenue increased from $1,061.00 million in 2023 to $1,383.00 million in 2024 (30.35%). The most significant growth was in NGL sales and other revenue, while refined product sales and natural gas sales experienced declines. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating expenses increased from $4,368.00 million in 2023 to $5,164.00 million in 2024, a rise of 18.23%. Depreciation, depletion, and amortization increased from $4,385.00 million in 2023 to $5,165.00 million in 2024 (17.79%). Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased from $985.00 million in 2023 to $1,177.00 million in 2024 (19.49%). Operating income increased from $8,295.00 million in 2023 to $9,138.00 million in 2024 (10.16%). The operating margin improved from 10.55% in 2023 to 11.05% in 2024. Despite increases in all categories of operating expenses, the growth in revenue and gross margin outpaced these increases, leading to an improved operating margin. This suggests effective cost management relative to revenue generation, particularly given the significant acquisitions and assets placed in service during 2024. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 5.41% in 2023 to 7.61% in 2024. This increase was primarily due to the taxable gain recognized by a corporate subsidiary of Sunoco LP on its sale of West Texas assets in 2024. Impairment losses and other increased from $12.00 million in 2023 to $52.00 million in 2024, mainly related to Sunoco LP's termination of a lease. Gains on interest rate derivatives decreased significantly from $36.00 million in 2023 to $6.00 million in 2024, indicating less favorable changes in forward interest rates. Unrealized gains on commodity risk management activities shifted from a gain of $3.00 million in 2023 to a loss of $56.00 million in 2024. Inventory valuation adjustments (Sunoco LP) changed from a $114.00 million reduction in net income in 2023 to an $86.00 million reduction in 2024, indicating a smaller negative impact from lower of cost or market adjustments. Losses on extinguishments of debt increased from $2.00 million in 2023 to $12.00 million in 2024. A significant non-operating litigation-related loss of $627.00 million was recognized in 2023, which did not recur in 2024. Conversely, a gain on sale of Sunoco LP West Texas assets of $586.00 million was recognized in 2024, which was a one-off positive impact. |

Net income attributable to partners increased by 22.35% to $4,814.00 million from $3,935.00 million. Basic net income per common unit increased by 17.27% to $1.29 from $1.10. Diluted net income per common unit increased by 17.43% to $1.28 from $1.09. The increase in net income was significantly influenced by the $586.00 million gain on the sale of Sunoco LP's West Texas assets and the absence of the $627.00 million non-operating litigation-related loss present in 2023. | Net income decreased by 9.78% to $5,294.00 million from $5,868.00 million. Net income attributable to partners decreased by 17.37% to $3,935.00 million from $4,756.00 million. Basic net income per common unit decreased by 21.43% to $1.10 from $1.40. Diluted net income per common unit decreased by 22.14% to $1.09 from $1.40. The decrease was primarily due to a $627.00 million non-operating litigation-related loss and lower gains on interest rate derivatives, partially offset by increased equity in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates and lower impairment losses compared to 2022. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating income increased by 10.16% to $9,138.00 million from $8,295.00 million. Operating margin improved from 10.55% in 2023 to 11.05% in 2024. Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased by 13.03% to $15,483.00 million from $13,698.00 million. This improvement was driven by strong performance in the midstream, crude oil transportation and services, and NGL and refined products transportation and services segments, benefiting from acquisitions and higher volumes. | Operating income increased by 7.20% to $8,295.00 million from $7,738.00 million. Operating margin decreased from 8.61% in 2022 to 10.55% in 2023. Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased by 4.62% to $13,698.00 million from $13,093.00 million. This was primarily due to higher throughput and contractual rates in NGL and refined products transportation, and higher volumes in crude oil and interstate transportation, partially offset by declines in midstream and intrastate transportation. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Total debt increased by 14.08% to $59,760.00 million from $52,388.00 million. Interest expense, net of interest capitalized, increased by 21.22% to $3,125.00 million from $2,578.00 million. The debt-to-equity ratio increased slightly to 1.30 from 1.28. The company's ability to manage increased debt levels and interest expenses will be crucial. The increase in cash and cash equivalents and operating cash flow provides a buffer against financial risks. | Total debt increased by 8.54% to $52,388.00 million from $48,262.00 million. Interest expense, net of interest capitalized, increased by 11.84% to $2,578.00 million from $2,306.00 million. The debt-to-equity ratio increased to 1.28 from 1.26. The company faces risks from commodity price volatility, credit risk of customers, and potential increases in interest rates. The non-operating litigation loss in 2023 highlights exposure to legal and regulatory risks. |
| Future financial performance projection | The company projects continued growth supported by production improvements, increased asset utilization, and strong domestic and international demand. Capital expenditures for 2025 are projected at $5,000.00 million for growth and $1,100.00 million for maintenance, indicating ongoing investment. The company expects to maintain ample liquidity and access to debt capital markets. The focus on alternative energy projects also signals diversification and long-term sustainability efforts. | The company anticipates future growth from production improvements, improved market conditions, and increased utilization of existing assets.
