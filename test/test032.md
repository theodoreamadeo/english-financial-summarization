| Future financial performance projection | The company is in a high-growth phase with significant capital expenditure planned, as evidenced by the 287.08% increase in capital commitments for property, plant and equipment. The successful capital raising of $1,295.35 million in 2024 provides substantial liquidity ($2.70 billion total liquidity) to fund these growth initiatives, including expansion into Asia (KL1 Kuala Lumpur) and new domestic data centers (A1 Adelaide, D1 Darwin). The focus on AI-ready infrastructure and strategic partnerships (e.g., NVIDIA) positions the company for future demand in high-density computing. However, the increasing net loss and declining profitability ratios (net profit margin, ROE, ROA) suggest that the company is prioritizing long-term growth over short-term profitability, with upfront costs (depreciation, finance costs) impacting current earnings. The decrease in operating margin also indicates some efficiency challenges amidst rapid expansion. | The company is actively expanding its data center footprint domestically and internationally, with new facilities in Sydney (S3, S5), Melbourne (M3, M4), Adelaide (A1), Darwin (D1), Port Hedland (PH1), Newman (NE1), Kuala Lumpur (KL1), and Auckland (AK1). The successful upsizing of debt facilities to $2.90 billion and equity raising of $617.94 million in 2023 provide funding for these expansions. The strong growth in contracted utilization (up 47.23%) indicates future revenue potential. However, the shift from net profit to net loss and declining profitability ratios suggest that the significant capital investments are impacting current earnings. The decrease in EBITDA margin also points to some operational efficiency challenges. The company's focus on AI and other megatrends is expected to drive future demand. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

### 4.1.1. Market Risks

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | NEXTDC operates in a highly competitive industry where staying at the forefront of technology and business systems is essential to maintain customer satisfaction and market share. The rapid rise of AI is further heating the sector, intensifying competition for top talent. The demand for resilient, reliable, efficient data center capacity continues to be underpinned by ongoing growth from cloud services and increasing adoption of enterprise colocation. These trends are being complemented and sharply accelerated by the broad adoption of AI. The Australian AI market is projected to exceed US$3.22 billion (A$4.8 billion) in 2024, growing at a 28.55% CAGR to US$14.53 billion (A$21.7 billion) by 2030. The Asia-Pacific data center market saw operational capacity soar past 10GW in 2023, with an additional 3.9GW under construction and 9.4GW in planning. NEXTDC's strategy is centered around supporting the growth requirements of customers, both domestically and internationally, as they execute their growth and innovation agendas, including the deployment of AI services. The company has strong relationships with key customers and their decision-makers who guide strategic deployment decisions across Australia and Asia. High-density computing, as required by AI, comes with extremely complex and resilient power, cooling, security, and interconnection requirements, which are core brand promises of NEXTDC. The company's expansion into Asia, with KL1 Kuala Lumpur underway and plans for Japan, aims to capitalize on these regional growth opportunities. | NEXTDC operates in a high-growth industry with strong and ongoing competitive pressures for top talent, both internationally and locally. The increasing digitization of businesses and the exponential growth of data capture, sharing, storage, and analysis have created a thriving digital economy. Forbes estimates that approximately 90% of the world's data has been generated in just the past two years, with over 2.5 quintillion bytes of additional data produced daily. Thriving ecosystems of clouds, carriers, service providers, and customers, required to manage this information, have become ever-more dependent on resilient, secured, and interconnected digital infrastructure. The data center services industry continues to experience remarkable growth, with Australia's data center industry projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.1% during 2022-2028, and the Asia-Pacific Data Centre Market expected to reach US$53.58 billion in 2028, expanding at a CAGR of 12% from 2023 to 2028. The rapid emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) applications is encouraging major cloud service providers and technology suppliers to scale up in support of massive data management challenges. AI is expected to fundamentally change the infrastructure requirements of many customers, with traditional on-premise data centers unsuited to its demands for denser power deployments, liquid cooling solutions, 100% uptime, and a thriving ecosystem of interconnected services. NEXTDC's value proposition, built on these requirements, positions it to play an important role in this technological revolution. |

### 4.1.2. Operational Risks

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Operational Risks | NEXTDC's operations face risks related to the inability to provide service due to data center failures, which could disrupt operations and breach service level agreements. To mitigate this, facilities are built with high redundancy, backup power, and cooling systems. Regular testing, expert design, and external certifications ensure uninterrupted service and a 100% uptime commitment. Development projects involve risks such as not obtaining suitable sites or regulatory approvals in time, development costs exceeding projections, unforeseen project delays, supply chain disruptions, or non-performance by contractors. NEXTDC mitigates these through standardized processes for planning, designing, engineering, procuring, and managing projects. The company also faces the risk of insufficient customer demand for new data centers, which are capital-intensive and often built without pre-sales commitments. This is managed by aligning site development with market trends and customer needs, and by adopting scalable data center designs. Workplace, Health, and Safety (WHS) risks are managed through a proactive safety program, ISO 45001 certification, and continuous review processes, aiming for zero workplace injuries. Energy usage and emissions are operational risks, with increased customer demand leading to higher energy consumption. NEXTDC addresses this through energy-efficient designs, PUE targets (achieving 1.42 in FY24), and investments in renewable energy. | NEXTDC faces operational risks related to its 100% uptime guarantee, where catastrophic failure or equipment malfunction could breach service level agreements and incur contractual liabilities. This is mitigated by designing and building data centers with sufficient redundancy, including redundant paths for power and cooling, to allow components to go offline without affecting customer IT equipment. A sound assurance and maintenance program, periodic recovery testing, in-house design expertise, and third-party peer review and certification are in place. Development projects for new and existing data centers are capital-intensive and carry risks such as delays in obtaining suitable sites or regulatory approvals, cost escalations, unforeseen project delays, supply chain issues, and contractor non-performance. NEXTDC manages these risks through standardized processes for planning, design, engineering, procurement, and project management. Customer demand risk is managed by aligning site development with market demand and customer needs, and by adopting scalable fit-outs to match incremental capital investment with customer contracts. Workplace, Health, and Safety (WHS) is a key focus, with a goal of zero workplace injuries, ISO 45001 certification, and proactive safety programs including mental health support. Energy usage and emissions are operational risks, with increased customer loads leading to higher energy consumption. NEXTDC addresses this through energy-efficient designs, PUE targets (achieving 1.39 in FY23), and investments in renewable energy. |
