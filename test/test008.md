# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Perspective | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | The company's revenue increased significantly from RM542,358,902.00 in 2023 to RM863,587,000.00 in 2024, representing a growth of 59.23%. This growth was primarily driven by higher average Crude Palm Oil (CPO) and Palm Kernel (PK) prices, which increased by 11.00% and 33.00% respectively, and a 31.00% rise in Fresh Fruit Bunches (FFB) production. The gross margin is not explicitly provided, but the profit before tax margin increased from 23.87% in 2023 to 29.27% in 2024, indicating improved profitability relative to revenue. Revenue distribution by product/service shows that milling operations contributed 74.40% of the Group's revenue in 2023 (RM403,634,163.00) and 80.85% in 2024 (RM698,220,000.00), indicating a continued reliance on milling for revenue generation. Revenue by geographic region is not explicitly provided, but operations are primarily in Pahang State, Malaysia. |
| Operating Efficiency | The company's operating efficiency improved significantly from 2023 to 2024. Profit before tax increased by 95.25% from RM129,457,119.00 in 2023 to RM252,764,000.00 in 2024. The profit before tax margin increased from 23.87% in 2023 to 29.27% in 2024. This improvement was driven by higher average CPO and PK prices, increased FFB production, and enhanced operational efficiency in milling operations. Employee benefits expense increased from RM32,103,846.00 in 2023 to RM40,104,000.00 in 2024 (24.92% increase), while depreciation of property, plant and equipment remained relatively stable (RM27,422,599.00 in 2023 vs. RM28,284,000.00 in 2024, a 3.14% increase). Upkeep and cultivation costs decreased by 20.90% from RM45,130,835.00 in 2023 to RM35,715,000.00 in 2024, contributing to better cost management. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate for the Group increased from 18.57% in 2023 (RM24,037,313.00 tax expense on RM129,457,119.00 profit before tax) to 19.94% in 2024 (RM50,414,000.00 tax expense on RM252,764,000.00 profit before tax). This indicates a higher proportion of profit being paid as tax in 2024. A non-recurring item in 2024 was the goodwill written off amounting to RM4,998,000.00, which negatively impacted profitability. In 2023, a fair value gain on investment property of RM2,000,000.00 positively impacted profitability, while a loss on deemed disposal of an associate of RM555,666.00 had a negative impact. The capital repayment on other investment of RM581,180.00 in 2023 was recognized as other operating income. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | The company faces market risks from fluctuating CPO prices, rising operational costs, and shifting trade policies, particularly due to global supply-demand dynamics, policy changes in major importing countries, and currency fluctuations. Geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties further exacerbate price volatility. A RM100 per MT change in CPO price is estimated to impact revenue by approximately RM8.7 million. | The company faces market risks from lower CPO and PK prices, which decreased by 22% and 32% respectively in FY2023 compared to FY2022. This was due to higher output, increasing inventory, and changes in the economic conditions of other oil crops. The lifting of Indonesia's palm oil export ban also contributed to price volatility. |
| Operational Risks | Operational risks include labour shortages, particularly with increasing regulatory scrutiny on foreign worker policies, and climate-related risks such as prolonged dry spells and erratic rainfall affecting plantation yields. The company is addressing these through mechanization, automation, and sustainable agriculture practices. | Operational risks include a significant decrease in FFB production (down 11% from 2022) due to lower yields in the first half of 2023, as palms recovered from high yields in 2022, and heavy rainfall in December 2023. Labour shortages also impacted FFB production, although the situation improved with increased foreign worker recruitment. |
| Financial Risks | Financial risks include volatile CPO prices, which directly impact revenue and profitability. The company's financial performance is also sensitive to rising operational costs and currency fluctuations. The acquisition of Merchong Palm Oil Mill Sdn. Bhd. (MPOM) for RM10 million, satisfied by cash and assumed liabilities of RM52.86 million, introduces integration risks. | Financial risks include a 31% decrease in revenue and a 53% decrease in profit before tax in FY2023 compared to FY2022, primarily due to lower CPO and PK prices and reduced FFB production. Higher FFB cost (RM326 per MT, up 14% from 2022) due to recruitment expenses and higher wages also impacted profitability. |
| Compliance Risks | Compliance risks are driven by evolving sustainability-linked trade policies, such as the European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), which could impact market access. The company is reinforcing traceability measures and expanding sustainability certifications to align with global compliance standards. | Compliance risks include adhering to MSPO and ISCC certification standards, which are mandatory for sustainable palm oil production. The company also faces scrutiny regarding labor practices, including foreign worker policies, to avoid exploitation and modern slavery. |

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |

| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The Group anticipates an increasingly complex operating environment in 2025 and beyond, marked by geopolitical tensions, economic uncertainties, and climate-related risks. Key challenges include volatile crude palm oil (CPO) prices, rising operational costs, and shifting trade policies. The report notes that a RM100 per MT change in CPO price is estimated to impact revenue by approximately RM8.7 million. Macroeconomic pressures, such as high interest rates and currency fluctuations, also pose challenges. | The Group faced challenges from lower commodity prices in FY2023 due to the subsided impact of the Russia-Ukraine war and the lifting of Indonesia's palm oil export ban. This led to a decrease in CPO and PK average prices by 22% and 32% respectively. The Group also experienced higher FFB cost due to increased recruitment expenses for foreign workers and higher wages. The report anticipates that 2024 will continue to be challenging, with persistent trends in average CPO selling prices and potential impacts from El-Nino on production and prices. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces. | The report highlights that regulatory risks, particularly sustainability-linked trade policies like the European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), could impact market access. FEHB is reinforcing traceability measures and expanding sustainability certifications to align with global compliance standards, indicating competitive pressures related to market access and regulatory adherence. | The report mentions that the palm oil industry is influenced by geo-strategic factors and changing global landscapes. The Group's adherence to MSPO and ISCC certifications is noted as providing a competitive advantage in securing premium prices and strengthening trust from customers, implying competitive pressures in the market for sustainable palm oil. |
