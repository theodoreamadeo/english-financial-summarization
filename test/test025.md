# Section 3: Business Analysis

## 3.1 Profitability Analysis

| Perspective | Answer |
| :---------- | :----- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | **Revenue Growth:** The company experienced significant revenue growth from 2023 to 2024. Total revenue increased by 20.97%, from £1,580.70 million in 2023 to £1,912.10 million in 2024. This growth was primarily organic, with a 14.00% organic constant currency growth in 2024, compared to 12.00% in 2023. <br><br> **Gross Margin:** The reports do not provide a direct gross margin calculation. However, by analyzing the operating costs excluding depreciation and amortization relative to revenue, we can infer trends. In 2023, these costs were £1,382.90 million against £1,580.70 million revenue, while in 2024 they were £1,670.40 million against £1,912.10 million revenue. This suggests a relatively stable relationship between direct costs and revenue. <br><br> **Revenue by Product/Service:** The company's revenue is primarily derived from services contracts, which accounted for £1,811.20 million in 2024 (94.72% of total revenue) compared to £1,481.40 million in 2023 (93.72% of total revenue). Sale of goods contracts contributed £95.70 million in 2024 (5.01% of total revenue) versus £96.10 million in 2023 (6.08% of total revenue). Royalties and licenses saw an increase from £3.20 million in 2023 to £5.20 million in 2024. The shift indicates a continued focus and growth in service-based offerings. <br><br> **Revenue by Geographic Region:** The "Home countries" (UK, US, Australia) remain the dominant source of revenue, accounting for 94.00% (£1,798.30 million) in 2024, a slight increase from 93.00% (£1,470.80 million) in 2023. The UK government remains the largest customer, with revenue increasing from £969.40 million in 2023 to £1,184.90 million in 2024. US government revenue also saw substantial growth, from £230.80 million in 2023 to £389.30 million in 2024. Revenue from Europe decreased from £69.40 million in 2023 to £52.80 million in 2024, while the Rest of World segment grew from £40.50 million to £61.00 million. This highlights the company's strengthening focus on its core AUKUS markets. |
| Operating Efficiency | **Operating Expenses:** Operating costs excluding depreciation and amortisation increased from £1,382.90 million in 2023 to £1,670.40 million in 2024, reflecting the growth in revenue and business operations. <br><br> **Operating Income:** Statutory operating profit increased by 11.40%, from £172.80 million in 2023 to £192.50 million in 2024. Underlying operating profit, which excludes specific adjusting items, also grew significantly by 20.08%, from £178.90 million in 2023 to £215.20 million in 2024. <br><br> **Operating Margins:** The underlying operating margin remained stable at 11.30% in both 2023 and 2024. This indicates that while the company is growing its revenue and operating profit, its cost management and operational efficiency relative to revenue have been consistent. The stability in operating margin suggests effective cost control in line with revenue expansion, despite increased operational scale. |
| External & One-Off Impact | **Effective Tax Rate:** The total effective tax rate decreased from 19.60% in 2023 to 23.60% in 2024. The underlying effective tax rate, which excludes specific adjusting items, increased from 19.40% in 2023 to 25.30% in 2024. This increase is primarily due to the change in the UK statutory corporation tax rate from 19.00% to 25.00% effective April 1, 2023, and higher overseas tax rates. <br><br> **Non-Recurring Items:** Specific adjusting items had a significant impact on profitability. In 2023, these items resulted in a net gain of £2.30 million before tax, primarily driven by a £19.60 million credit from the release of RDEC MOD appropriation liability and a £15.90 million gain on business divestments, partially offset by acquisition and integration costs. In 2024, specific adjusting items resulted in a net loss of £44.30 million before tax. This was mainly due to increased digital investment costs (£16.90 million vs. £5.80 million in 2023), higher amortisation of acquisition intangibles (£25.20 million vs. £15.60 million in 2023), and acquisition/disposal costs (£9.20 million vs. £18.70 million in 2023). The shift from a net gain to a net loss from these items significantly impacted statutory profit before tax, which decreased from £192.00 million in 2023 to £182.70 million in 2024, despite an increase in underlying profit. |

| Profitability and earnings quality | Underlying profit after tax increased by 10.92% to £169.60 million, driven by strong organic revenue growth and stable operating margins. However, statutory profit for the year decreased by 9.52% to £139.60 million, largely due to a net loss from specific adjusting items. Underlying basic EPS grew by 10.94% to 29.40p, while statutory basic EPS decreased by 9.70% to 24.20p. The effective tax rate increased to 23.60% (underlying 25.30%) due to changes in UK corporation tax rates. | Underlying profit after tax increased by 29.47% to £152.90 million, reflecting strong revenue growth and improved profit margins.

| Financial risk identification and early warning | The company significantly reduced its net debt from £206.90 million in 2023 to £151.20 million in 2024, improving its leverage (net debt to EBITDA) from 0.8x to 0.5x. This indicates a stronger financial position and reduced financial risk. The company maintained compliance with all loan covenants. The increase in the underlying effective tax rate to 25.30% suggests a higher tax burden going forward, which could impact future net profitability. | The company transitioned from a net cash position to a net debt of £206.90 million in 2023, with a leverage (net debt to EBITDA) of 0.8x. This increased financial risk compared to the previous year but was within management's expectations and guidance. The company complied with all loan covenants. The effective tax rate was 19.60%, which was relatively low due to specific adjusting items. |
| Future financial performance projection | The company projects high single-digit organic revenue growth and stable operating profit margins of 11-12% for FY25, with 64.00% of FY25 revenue already under contract. It aims for approximately £2.40 billion organic revenue at 12.00% margin by FY27, delivering an attractive ROCE of 15-20%+. Cash conversion is expected to remain high at 90.00%+, with capital expenditure between £90.00 million and £120.00 million. The strengthened balance sheet provides optionality for bolt-on acquisitions and further shareholder returns. | The company upgraded its FY27 ambition to £3.00 billion revenue at stable 11-12% margins, targeting high single-digit organic revenue growth supplemented by strategic acquisitions. It expected high single-digit revenue growth for FY24, with 61.00% of revenue under contract. Operating profit margin was projected at the lower end of the 11-12% range.
