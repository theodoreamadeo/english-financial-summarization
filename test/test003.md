# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | The company faces significant market risks due to ongoing geopolitical conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, leading to trade tensions, disruptions to trade routes, and higher freight charges. Inflation and rising raw material costs, particularly for coffee beans due to climate change, also impact profitability. Currency devaluation in key markets against the US dollar further affects revenue when translated. The company is actively strengthening its presence in Asia to mitigate these global uncertainties, but the unpredictable nature of post-election policy changes in the US and threats of trade protectionism add to market volatility. | The company faces market risks from geopolitical events and extreme weather conditions, which affect food supply chains and drive up logistical costs. Inflationary pressures and rising coffee prices also impact profitability. The depreciation of the Russian Ruble against the US dollar significantly reduced reported revenue from the Russia segment, despite local currency growth. The company's strategy to diversify beyond traditional markets and product lines, with a focus on South-East Asia and South Asia, aims to mitigate these risks. |
| Operational Risks | Operational risks include severe disruptions to trade routes and major logistical inconveniences caused by geopolitical tensions. Rising operational costs due to inflation and increasing raw material prices, such as coffee beans, pose challenges. The company is mitigating these by optimizing business processes and intensifying sales and marketing efforts. Investments in capacity expansion, such as the non-dairy creamer facility in Malaysia and a new coffee-mix production facility in Kazakhstan, aim to enhance efficiency and meet growing demand, but also introduce risks associated with project execution and ramp-up to full utilization. | Operational risks include supply chain constraints, rising raw material prices (especially coffee), and the need for government approvals for expanded production capacities (e.g., non-dairy creamer factory in Malaysia). The company's strategy involves expanding manufacturing capabilities and strengthening brands to address robust demand, but this also entails risks related to managing increased production and distribution complexities. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine continues to pose an uncertainty to operations in those regions. |
| Financial Risks | Financial risks include a decrease in normalised net profit after tax by 11.4% to US$50.0 million in FY2024, reflecting the impact of record high coffee prices and higher overall expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased by 14.2%, and general and administrative expenses rose by 15.6% due to increased consumer engagement and legal/professional fees related to redeemable exchangeable notes. The company's debt to equity ratio increased from 14.0% in 2023 to 15.4% in 2024 (excluding redeemable exchangeable notes). The issuance of US$40.0 million in redeemable exchangeable notes introduces new financial obligations and fair value adjustments. | Financial risks include the impact of unfavourable exchange rate changes, particularly the depreciation of the Russian Ruble against the US dollar, which reduced reported revenue. Increased selling and marketing expenses (up 10.2%) and general and administrative expenses (up from US$37.5 million to US$38.9 million) due to higher manpower costs also affect profitability. The company's net profit after tax, while growing, is sensitive to these cost pressures and currency fluctuations. The company's gearing ratio was -14% in 2023, indicating a net cash position, but this can be affected by operational and market challenges. |
| Compliance Risks | Compliance risks involve adhering to complex global regulations, including sanctions-related laws and regulations, especially given operations in regions affected by geopolitical tensions. The company has internal controls to monitor and mitigate these risks, but the volatile situation in Eastern Europe and the Middle East could lead to unforeseen compliance challenges. Changes in tax legislation across various countries of operation also pose a risk of further tax liabilities if interpretations differ from tax authorities. The company is committed to upholding high standards in corporate governance and ethical behavior, but the dynamic regulatory landscape requires continuous monitoring. | Compliance risks include navigating varying interpretations of tax legislation in countries of operation, which could lead to additional tax liabilities. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine also presents sanctions-related risks, requiring the company to monitor and mitigate potential impacts on its operations. The company emphasizes adherence to its business ethics and code of conduct, but the complexity of international regulations necessitates continuous vigilance to avoid legal and reputational damage. |
