HK): $10,306M; Other: $10,245M | The submitted answer contains incorrect revenue figures for all regions compared to the ground truth, and the units are not consistent (missing 'M' for millions). |
| 3.1.1_rev_cost_dynamics | Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics (use key metrics: Revenue Growth ; Gross Margin; Revenue by Product/Service; Revenue by Geographic Region) | 0.0000 | Incorrect | 126% YoY growth driven by AI boom (Data Center +213%). Gross Margin: 57.9%. Data Center: 47,562; Gaming: 10,447; United States: 26,152; Taiwan: 14,876; China: 10,328; Other: 9,566 | Revenue experienced dramatic growth from 2022-2024, increasing 126% from 2022-2024, with the most significant jump occurring in 2024 (126% increase from 2023). This growth was primarily driven by the Compute & Networking segment, which became the dominant revenue driver, growing from $11,046M in 2022 to $47,405M in 2024. Graphics revenue declined from $15,868M in 2022 to $11,906M in 2023 but recovered to $13,517M in 2024. Geographically, the US became the largest market, growing from $4,349M in 2022 to $26,966M in 2024. Gross margin improved significantly to 72.72% in 2024 from 56.92% in 2023, though it remained below the 2022 level of 64.95%. The margin improvement in 2024 reflects better cost management and product mix optimization despite higher absolute costs. | The submitted answer incorrectly states the gross margin as 57.9% instead of the ground truth of 72.72%. Additionally, the revenue figures by product/service and geographic region do not match the ground truth values, and the explanation of revenue growth lacks the context of the Compute & Networking segment and the decline and recovery of Graphics revenue. |
| 3.1.2_operating_efficiency | Operating Efficiency (key metric: Operating Margin) | 0.0000 | Incorrect | 21.3% | Operating efficiency showed remarkable improvement, with operating margin reaching 54.13% in 2024, a substantial increase from 15.66% in 2023, and higher than 37.32% achieved in 2022. The 2023 decline to 15.66% represented a significant efficiency challenge, but the company demonstrated strong operational leverage in 2024. | The submitted answer of 21.3% is incorrect as the ground truth states the operating margin reached 54.13% in 2024. |
| 3.1.3_external_one_off | External & One-Off Impact (key metrics: Effective Tax Rate, Non-Recurring Items) | 0.0000 | Incorrect | Effective Tax Rate: 14.5% | The effective tax rate showed significant variation across the period, moving from 1.90% in 2022 to -4.47% in 2023 (indicating a tax benefit), and then to 12.00% in 2024. The negative tax rate in 2023 provided a one-time benefit to profitability, with the company receiving a tax benefit of $187M despite having pre-tax income of $4,181M. In 2024, the normalization of the tax rate to 12.00% represented a more typical tax burden, with tax expense of $4,058M on pre-tax income of $33,818M. This tax normalization had a moderating effect on net profit growth compared to the exceptional 2023 tax benefit. | The submitted answer provides a single effective tax rate of 14.5%, which does not match the ground truth values of 1.90% in 2022, -4.47% in 2023, and 12.00% in 2024. Additionally, it lacks the context of the significant variation and the one-time tax benefit mentioned in the ground truth. |

Puri; Debora Shoquist; Timothy S. Teter | The submitted answer includes two correct names (Colette Kress and Timothy Teter) but misses three others (Ajay K. Puri, Debora Shoquist) and has a name (Jensen Huang) that is not fully accurate as it should be 'Jen-Hsun Huang'. |
| 5.1.2_board_position | Board Composition - Position | 0.0000 | Incorrect | ["CEO", "CFO", "General Counsel"] | President and Chief Executive Officer; Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Executive Vice President, Worldwide Field Operations; Executive Vice President, Operations; Executive Vice President and General Counsel | The submitted answer does not match the ground truth in terms of titles and completeness.
