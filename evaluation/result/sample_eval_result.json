      "submitted_answer": "Effective Tax Rate: 14.5%",
      "ground_truth": "The effective tax rate showed significant variation across the period, moving from 1.90% in 2022 to -4.47% in 2023 (indicating a tax benefit), and then to 12.00% in 2024. The negative tax rate in 2023 provided a one-time benefit to profitability, with the company receiving a tax benefit of $187M despite having pre-tax income of $4,181M. In 2024, the normalization of the tax rate to 12.00% represented a more typical tax burden, with tax expense of $4,058M on pre-tax income of $33,818M. This tax normalization had a moderating effect on net profit growth compared to the exceptional 2023 tax benefit.",

Additionally, it lacks the context of the significant variation and the one-time tax benefit mentioned in the ground truth."
