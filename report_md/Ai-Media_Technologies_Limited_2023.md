# Chair's letter

DEANNE WEIR  
CHAIR

Dear fellow Shareholders,

This has been another year of significant transformation for your Company, and I am pleased to present the Annual Report for the financial 2023 year (FY23). We have continued to refine our product solutions and enhance our technology, to ensure we are well positioned for increased growth in an expanding global captioning, transcription and translation market.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/53c4ef22-0087-4d45-acff-f80fa9f8d7ae/644d655e9659c5c2ac1039f5b66baab728bbdeb916977d98256fcbce17c3f3fa.jpg)

Our improved financial performance over the year was underpinned by our high-quality technology and scalable suite of solutions, that are designed to meet the varying quality, security and accuracy needs of our customers. This increased flexibility allowed us to attract new customers and continue to deliver great value to our existing customers. Some customers have changed their service mix, swapping out human delivered services where their needs are better met by our technology led solutions. This change in services impacts our revenue mix, pleasingly we have continued to deliver both topline revenue growth and significant improvement to the bottom line during this ongoing transformation.

Our FY23 financial performance demonstrates the reformation in our business approach towards higher quality revenue streams, which underpinned FY23 revenue of  $61.8 million, a 3.3% increase on FY22. Gross Profit of$ 36.9 million, a 12% increase on FY22 with over 54% of Gross Profit now coming from technology revenues. The Company delivered $3.3 million of earnings before interest, tax depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), an increase of 201% compared to FY22, further highlighting increased operating leverage in the business.

As we continue our transformation into higher margin, SaaS products, we have observed a growing demand for language services across entertainment, government, and corporate clients. Through our engagement with customers across the globe we have continued to build our reputation for delivering extremely accurate, low-cost captioning and translation services, and have been rewarded with new premium contract signings from customers including Google and SBS, in addition to renewed agreements with Foxtel and Al Jazeera.

We remain committed to driving further growth and profitability via broadening our SaaS offerings and believe our product suite is well-placed to take advantage of mandated spending across captioning and translation services by potential customers including broadcasters.

Social inclusion and equity is in our DNA. Our Company has a long history of advancing social inclusion throughout all business operations and making the world's content accessible to all. Last year we launched the Leonie Jackson Education Grant, and I am pleased to share that the 2022 recipient is Sylvia Ciechanowski. In the year ahead, Sylvia will put the $10,000 grant towards completing the Post-Professional Doctor of Audiology Program at A.T. Still University. We continue to nurture a diverse workplace that fosters inclusivity and career development. As at 30 June 2023 40% of Al-Media's leadership team, 54% of our employees and 60% of our board identify as women.

We continue to build upon our purpose to be inclusive to all and continue to be focused on our commitment to achieve growth by investing in our people and products. We believe it is this vision that deepens our appeal to potential customers, making AI-Media an attractive captioning partner of choice.

Throughout the year the transformation strategy was at the forefront of AI-Media's work, with continued investment being made in the business to accelerate growth and deliver significant value to shareholders. As a fellow shareholder I believe the share price has not reflected the inherent value of our Company.

We are seeking to rectify this by continuing to improve our product suite, upselling to our existing customer base and winning new customers. Ending the year with a cash balance of  $17.0 million (from which the final amounts of US$ 5.25 million for previous acquisitions will be paid in Q1 FY24) puts us in a good position to capitalise on growth opportunities as they arise.

Despite the mismatch between the share price performance and the inherent value of the business, the current view of the Board is that we are better to preserve available cash for growth opportunities rather than undertake a further share buy-back program.

The growth achieved over the financial year would not have been achieved without the commitment of everyone at Al-Media. I would like to thank the team, including, management and the board, who have worked consistently and efficiently to deliver great results to our customers and to position the business for significant future growth. I am very proud of the entire team for the outstanding job achieved this financial year.

Finally, my sincere thanks to you, our shareholders. We greatly appreciate your continued support, and as we move into FY24 we look forward to updating you on our progress in delivering enhanced shareholder value.

# CEO's letter

TONY ABRAHAMS

CO-FOUNDER, CEO AND MANAGING DIRECTOR

FY23 cemented AI-Media's position as a global leader in the delivery of high-quality live and recorded captioning, transcription, and translation solutions, demonstrating the success of our transformational shift towards higher margin software-as-a-service (SaaS) revenues.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/53c4ef22-0087-4d45-acff-f80fa9f8d7ae/a211e9ff242f6a3302d14caa6d090d904e7af064fe7a8ee1b34c969e34785509.jpg)

Our results were underpinned by new customer wins, in addition to existing iCap customers who have transferred to our LEXI products and further product developments with the release of LEXI 3.0 in May 2023.

LEXI 3.0 provides a more accurate and advanced automatic captioning solution, delivering results that rival human captions at a fraction of the cost; with  $35\%$  fewer recognition, formatting, and punctuation errors than the previous version of LEXI. Our improved product accelerates automatic captioning adoption as it significantly increases quality, reduces latency, and includes new automated features that previously required manual intervention, including speaker changes and placement of captions to not obscure important visuals. We are extremely proud of LEXI 3.0 as it provides a streamlined product offering, enabling product differentiation in the market, whilst providing opportunities to expand our market reach and grow sales. Demand for LEXI continues to grow beyond broadcasting, with new sales wins in enterprise, government and corporate.

Our captioning monthly minutes increased  $21\%$ , delivering an average of 9 million minutes every month. Over the year we witnessed many customers increasing the minutes captioned via our suite of solutions, including Major League Baseball (MLB), the United Kingdom Parliament and a five-year contract renewal with major Australian broadcaster the Seven Network (Seven). AI-Media is well-positioned to capitalise on the increasing need by broadcasters to meet accessibility requirements, as more countries continue to adopt and implement accessibility legislation.

The renewal by Seven showcased the strength of our full suite of technology products, as the partnership included the broadcaster pioneering the use of our rebranded LEXI Library product (formerly SubSilo) with captioning powering intuitive search across Seven's extensive media archive. The successful multi-year contract signing with Google in August 2022 demonstrates AI-Media's position as a trusted partner by the corporate market.

Since acquiring EEG in May 2021, we have made strategic investments in our technology products, while transitioning the business away from legacy services towards higher margin SaaS revenues. It is this shift which has successfully underpinned FY23 revenue of $61.8 million, with 39% delivered via technology revenues, delivering an increase to Gross Profit Margins to 60% in FY23, up 5 percentage points on FY22. Overall, we witnessed strong growth in monthly captioning minutes, with LEXI minutes up 44% and iCap network minutes up 21%, this demonstrates further opportunity for conversion to LEXI product suite.

As the business transitions further towards SaaS revenues, we expect further improvements in operating leverage. FY23 delivered a 201% increase in EBITDA to $3.3 million in FY23 and an EBITDA margin of 5%, reflecting the scalability of the business model.

GROSS PROFIT MARGINS IN FY23

UP

5% points on FY22

To celebrate Al-Media's 20th anniversary in August 2023 and in recognition of our technology-led strategy, we launched a new brand and logo set. The rebrand champions our market-leading position, to meet the growing demand for accessible content worldwide, across a variety of industries.

As we seek to capture further market share in FY24 and beyond, our competitive moat continues to be strengthened by the transformative advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Our full range of encoding solutions (hardware, virtualised and cloud-based) together with access to customer data behind corporate firewalls are the key to unlocking this transformative potential of AI.

As we look to the future, we have strengthened our balance sheet, with a cash position of  $17.0 million as at 30 June 2023. In Q1 FY24 the final amounts of US\$ 5.25m for previous acquisitions will be paid, leaving the balance available for further product and market development.

The success we have achieved in our transformation to date would not have been possible without the efforts of our customers, dedicated employees and the leadership of the Board and management team.

Thank you to our shareholders for your patience through difficult market conditions. I look forward to updating you further as we build and extend our technology-led growth strategy.

# Ai-Media Technologies Limited

# Directors' report

30 June 2023

The directors present their report, together with the financial statements, on the consolidated entity (referred to hereafter as the 'Group') consisting of Ai-Media Technologies Limited (referred to hereafter as the 'Company' or 'parent entity') and the entities it controlled at the end of, or during, the year ended 30 June 2023.

# Directors

The following persons were directors of Ai-Media Technologies Limited during the whole of the financial year and up to the date of this report, unless otherwise stated:

Deanne Weir - Non-Executive Director and Chair

Anthony Abrahams - Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer

John Martin - Non-Executive Director

Alison Loat - Non-Executive Director

Cheryl Hayman - Non-Executive Director

# Principal activities

Ai-Media Technologies Limited (Ai-Media or Company) (ASX: AIM), is a global provider of technology-driven captioning, transcription and translation products and services.

# Dividends

There were no dividends paid, recommended or declared during the current or previous financial year.

# Review of operations

The loss for the Group after providing for income tax amounted to  $4,017,064 (30 June 2022:$ 4,923,715).

# Operations

A summary of the results for the year is as follows:

<table><tr><td></td><td>2023
$</td><td>2022
$</td><td>Change
$</td><td>Change
%</td></tr><tr><td>Revenue from operating activities</td><td>61,769,967</td><td>59,784,026</td><td>1,985,941</td><td>3.3%</td></tr><tr><td>Earnings/(loss) before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA)</td><td>3,310,552</td><td>1,100,574</td><td>2,209,978</td><td>200.8%</td></tr><tr><td>Loss after tax (expense)/benefit from ordinary activities</td><td>(4,017,064)</td><td>(4,923,715)</td><td>906,651</td><td>18.4%</td></tr></table>

EBITDA is a financial measure which is not prescribed by the Australian Accounting Standards (AASBs) and represents the profit under AASBs adjusted for specific items. The directors consider EBITDA to be one of the key financial measures of the Group.

The strengths of the technology and products introduced into the Group as part of the EEG acquisition in 2021 has provided the main impetus to the EBITDA growth. The legacy business continues to perform in the broadcast sector where tailored solutions and a high degree of accuracy is required. Comparatively, there has been a decline in legacy Live Enterprise services, especially in the education sector, where free tools have gained market share particularly where tailored solutions and a high degree of accuracy are not required.

As at 30 June 2023, the consolidated statement of financial position reflects a net asset position of $77,122,909 (30 June 2022: $78,960,817). The EBITDA growth along with a strong balance sheet with minimal debt has the Group well positioned to pursue our growth agenda and take advantage of new opportunities as they arise.

The following table summarises key reconciling items between statutory loss after income tax and EBITDA:

EBITDA for the Group was  $3,310,552 (2022:$ 1,100,574), showing significant progress in the Group's performance compared to the previous year.

# Liquidity

The consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the year ended 30 June 2023 reflects a net loss after income tax of  $4,017,064 (2022:$ 4,923,715) and the consolidated statement of cash flows reflects net cash inflows from operating activities of  $3,477,003 (2022:$ 1,893,490). As at 30 June 2023, the consolidated statement of financial position reflects a net asset position of  $77,122,909 (2022: net asset of$ 78,960,817) and a net current asset position of $10,395,527 (2022: net current asset of $16,444,315). While revenue for the period was up 3.3%, we saw a continuing strong growth in the share of higher margin technology sales (including hardware and SaaS) of total revenue 39%, compared to 30% in the prior year. The Group has successfully returned to a positive EBITDA, and with a robust balance sheet featuring a cash balance of nearly $17 million, along with improving performance, it is now well-positioned to confidently pursue growth and seize new opportunities as they arise.

The directors have assessed that based on the Group's position it is appropriate to prepare the financial report on a going concern basis. For further information, refer to note 2.

# Business risks

The following is a summary of material business risks that could adversely affect the Group's financial performance and growth potential in future years and how the Group propose to mitigate such risks.

# Macroeconomic risks

The Group's financial performance can be impacted by current and future economic conditions which it cannot control, such as increases in interest rates and inflation. The Group stays abreast of these conditions, focuses on its internal debtor controls and diversifies its customer base by industry and geography to help manage these risks.

# Ai-Media Technologies Limited

# Directors' report

30 June 2023

# Recruitment and crowd sourcing

It is evident that the labour landscape has displayed a trend of increasing availability within sectors such as technology, sales, operations, and professional services. However, labour market tightness persists as a noteworthy consideration. While inflationary pressures have also shown signs of stabilising, the consequences stemming from these pressures throughout the past year have led to a notable salary escalation of up to  $10\%$  beyond the initially budgeted projections for positions demanding professional expertise or high-level skills. In line with our ongoing business technology transformation, demand for crowd recruitment has also experienced a reduction. Tools such as LinkedIn Recruiter, LinkedIn advertising, and internal referrals continue to outperform traditional labour advertising avenues, mostly eliminating the need to engage recruitment agency services.

# Competitive market and changes to market trends

The Group operates in a highly competitive market. Innovation is constant and superior products that may be released to the market could result in pricing pressures upon our product and result in unfavourable product positioning within the market. The Group seeks to mitigate this risk through maintaining experienced product development teams that remain abreast of the latest technological advances and their potential impact on current and future products.

# Disruption to, or failure of, technology systems and software, including cybersecurity breaches

The risk of system disruption, either malicious or accidental is something that can never be completely mitigated against as technology and methods of potential disruption are constantly changing. We manage this risk in diverse ways, including utilising third parties to proactively review our environments and make recommendations for improvement, focusing on monitoring environments so we can spot any changes as they happen (before causing noticeable disruption) and by making sure we have backups and methods in place to reproduce environments from scratch in case the worst case scenario does happen.

# Data protection and privacy laws

Data protection and privacy laws are being implemented and updated across many jurisdictions globally. This could be a risk if we are not aware of the changes or not able to comply and therefore we need to make sure we are actively monitoring changes. We look to minimise this risk by basing our data protection and privacy standards on the most robust jurisdictions in order to aid in global compliance.

# Significant changes in the state of affairs

There were no significant changes in the state of affairs of the Group during the financial year.

# Matters subsequent to the end of the financial year

No matter or circumstance has arisen since 30 June 2023 that has significantly affected, or may significantly affect the Group's operations, the results of those operations, or the Group's state of affairs in future financial years.

# Likely developments and expected results of operations

The Group's growth strategy is focused on exploiting its strengths as a global leader in the provision of high-quality live and recorded captioning, transcription and translation products and services. Its technology platform combines artificial intelligence and human expertise to deliver speech-to-text at the accuracy required in the rapidly evolving broadcast and large enterprise markets. The key pillars of the Group's growth strategy are:

- drive growth of unified product offering in existing and new markets;  
- market standardised scalable global product portfolio solution;  
- focus on transitional sales of SaaS and Premium ASR in markets previously dominated by human captioning;  
ongoing organic growth of existing markets and customers;  
develop partnership opportunities and new sales channels; and  
consider acquisition opportunities, particularly of technology to enhance products.

performance linkage / alignment of executive compensation; and  
transparency.

The Remuneration and Nomination Committee is responsible for determining and reviewing remuneration arrangements for its directors and executives. The performance of the Group depends on the quality of its directors and executives. The remuneration philosophy is to attract, motivate and retain high performance and high quality personnel.

The Remuneration and Nomination Committee has structured an executive remuneration framework that is market competitive and complementary to the reward strategy of the Group.

The reward framework is designed to align executive reward to shareholders' interests. The Board has considered that it should seek to enhance shareholders' interests by:

- having economic profit as a core component of plan design;  
- focusing on sustained growth in shareholder wealth, consisting of dividends and growth in share price, and delivering constant or increasing return on assets as well as focusing the executive on key non-financial drivers of value; and  
- attracting and retaining high calibre executives.

Additionally, the reward framework should seek to enhance executives' interests by:

rewarding capability and experience;  
- reflecting competitive reward for contribution to growth in shareholder wealth; and  
- providing a clear structure for earning rewards.

In accordance with best practice corporate governance, the structure of non-executive director and executive director remuneration is separate.

# Non-executive directors' remuneration

Fees and payments to non-executive directors reflect the demands and responsibilities of their role. Non-executive directors' fees and payments are reviewed annually by the Remuneration and Nomination Committee. The Remuneration and Nomination Committee may, from time to time, receive advice from independent remuneration consultants to ensure nonexecutive directors' fees and payments are appropriate and in line with the market. The chair's fees are determined independently to the fees of other non-executive directors based on comparative roles in the external market. The chair is not present at any discussions relating to the determination of her own remuneration. As part of their remuneration package, eligible non-executive directors are granted up to $25,000 worth of restricted share units per year, which vest on a quarterly basis and are automatically exercised at the end of the financial year.

ASX listing rules require the aggregate non-executive directors' remuneration be determined periodically by a general meeting. The most recent determination was at the Annual General Meeting held on 9 August 2020, where the shareholders approved a maximum annual aggregate remuneration of $500,000.

# Executive remuneration

The Group aims to reward executives based on their position and responsibility, with a level and mix of remuneration which has both fixed and variable components.

The executive remuneration and reward framework has four components:

- base pay and non-monetary benefits;  
short-term performance incentives;  
- share-based payments; and  
- other remuneration such as superannuation and long service leave.

The combination of these comprises the executive's total remuneration.

# Directors' report

# 30 June 2023

Fixed remuneration, consisting of base salary, superannuation and non-monetary benefits, are reviewed annually by the Remuneration and Nomination Committee based on individual and business unit performance, the overall performance of the Group and comparable market remunerations.

Executives may receive their fixed remuneration in the form of cash or other fringe benefits (for example motor vehicle benefits) where it does not create any additional costs to the Group and provides additional value to the executive.

The short-term incentives (STI) program includes salaries, annual leave and other short term incentive payments and is designed to align the targets of the business units with the performance hurdles of executives. STI payments are granted to executives based on specific annual targets and key performance indicators (KPI's) being achieved. KPI's include profit contribution, customer satisfaction, leadership contribution and product management.

The long-term incentives (LTI) include long service leave and share-based payments. Shares are awarded to executives over a period of three years based on long-term incentive measures. These include increase in shareholders' value relative to the entire market and the increase compared to the Group's direct competitors. The Remuneration and Nomination Committee reviewed the long-term equity-linked performance incentives for executives during the financial year.

Under the LTI, eligible key management personnel may be given restricted share units (RSUs) which may be subject to vesting conditions set by the Board.

# Consolidated entity performance and link to remuneration

Remuneration for certain individuals is directly linked to the performance of the Group. A portion of cash bonus and incentive payments are dependent on defined earnings per share targets being met. The remaining portion of the cash bonus and incentive payments are at the discretion of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee. Refer to the section 'Additional information' below for details of the earnings and total shareholders return for the last five years.

The Remuneration and Nomination Committee is of the opinion that the continued improved results can be attributed in part to the adoption of performance based compensation and is satisfied that this improvement will continue to increase shareholder wealth if maintained over the coming years.

# Use of remuneration consultants

During the financial year ended 30 June 2023, the Group did not engage the use of remuneration consultants, to review its existing remuneration policies and provide recommendations on how to improve both the STI and LTI programs for future financial years.

# Voting and comments made at the Company's 30 June 2022 Annual General Meeting (AGM)

At the 23 November 2022 AGM,  $99.89\%$  of the votes received supported the adoption of the remuneration report for the year ended 30 June 2022. The Company did not receive any specific feedback at the AGM regarding its remuneration practices.

# Ai-Media Technologies Limited Notes to the consolidated financial statements 30 June 2023

# Note 1. General information

The financial statements cover Ai-Media Technologies Limited as a Group consisting of Ai-Media Technologies Limited (Company or parent entity) and the entities it controlled at the end of, or during, the year (referred to in these financial statements as the Group). The financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, which is Ai-Media Technologies Limited's functional and presentation currency.

Ai-Media Technologies Limited (formerly known as Access Innovation Holdings Limited) is a listed public company limited by shares, incorporated and domiciled in Australia. Its registered office and principal place of business are:

# Registered office

Level 20  
15 William Street  
Melbourne VIC 3000

# Principal place of business

Level 1  
103 Miller Street  
North Sydney NSW 2060

A description of the nature of the Group's operations and its principal activities are included in the directors' report, which is not part of the financial statements.

The financial statements were authorised for issue, in accordance with a resolution of directors, on 29 August 2023. The directors have the power to amend and reissue the financial statements.

# Note 2. Significant accounting policies

The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

# New or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations adopted

The Group has adopted all of the new, revised or amending Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) that are mandatory for the current reporting period. The adoption of these Accounting Standards and Interpretations did not have any significant impact on the financial performance or position of the Group.

Any new or amended Accounting Standards or Interpretations that are not yet mandatory have not been early adopted.

# Going concern

The financial report has been prepared on the going concern basis which contemplates the continuity of normal business activities and the realisation of assets and settlement of liabilities in the ordinary course of business and assumes the Group will have sufficient cash resources to pay their debts as and when they become due and payable for at least 12 months from the date of signing the financial report.

The consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the year ended 30 June 2023 reflects a net loss after income tax of  $4,017,064 (30 June 2022:$ 4,923,715) and the consolidated statement of cash flows reflects net cash inflows from operating activities of  $3,477,003 (30 June 2022:$ 1,893,490). As at 30 June 2023, the consolidated statement of financial position reflects a net asset position of  $77,122,909 (30 June 2022: net asset of$ 78,960,817) and a net current asset position of $10,395,527 (30 June 2022: net current asset of $16,444,315). While the Group continues to experience losses it is taking the necessary action to grow revenue sustainably and ensure that it will become profitable in the near future.

Based upon the growth of the business achieved to date, sufficient cash reserves at reporting date and after reviewing forecasts and projections prepared for the business, the directors are confident that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis.

# Change in Presentation of Financial Statements

During the current financial year, the management of the Company has introduced a revision in the presentation of the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, along with the comparative figures from the prior year. This modification involves a transition to a presentation by nature, aiming to enhance the clarity and transparency of financial information for the stakeholders. Importantly, to underscore that this transition in presentation format has been executed with utmost diligence, and it is confirmed that this change has no financial impact on the reported figures or overall financial standing of the Company.

# Basis of preparation

These general purpose financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) and the Corporations Act 2001, as appropriate for for-profit oriented entities. These financial statements also comply with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).

# Historical cost convention

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.

# Critical accounting estimates

The preparation of the financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in note 3.

# Parent entity information

In accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, these financial statements present the results of the Group only. Supplementary information about the parent entity is disclosed in note 32.

# Principles of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets and liabilities of all subsidiaries of Ai-Media Technologies Limited as at 30 June 2023 and the results of all subsidiaries for the year then ended.

Subsidiaries are all those entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.

Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between entities in the Group are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of the impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. A change in ownership interest, without the loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction, where the difference between the consideration transferred and the book value of the share of the non-controlling interest acquired is recognised directly in equity attributable to the parent.

# Ai-Media Technologies Limited Notes to the consolidated financial statements 30 June 2023

# Note 2. Significant accounting policies (continued)

Where the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets including goodwill, liabilities and non-controlling interest in the subsidiary together with any cumulative translation differences recognised in equity. The Group recognises the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any investment retained together with any gain or loss in profit or loss.

# Operating segments

Operating segments are presented using the 'management approach', where the information presented is on the same basis as the internal reports provided to the Chief Operating Decision Makers (CODM). The CODM is responsible for the allocation of resources to operating segments and assessing their performance.

# Foreign currency translation

# Foreign currency transactions

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the Company's functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at financial year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss.

# Foreign operations

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars using the exchange rates at the reporting date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars using the average exchange rates, which approximate the rates at the dates of the transactions, for the period. All resulting foreign exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income through the foreign currency reserve in equity.

The foreign currency reserve is recognised in profit or loss when the foreign operation or net investment is disposed of.

# Revenue recognition

The Group recognises revenue as follows:

# Revenue from contracts with customers

Revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group is expected to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. For each contract with a customer, the Group: identifies the contract with a customer; identifies the performance obligations in the contract; determines the transaction price which takes into account estimates of variable consideration and the time value of money; allocates the transaction price to the separate performance obligations on the basis of the relative stand-alone selling price of each distinct good or service to be delivered; and recognises revenue when or as each performance obligation is satisfied in a manner that depicts the transfer to the customer of the goods or services promised.

Variable consideration within the transaction price, if any, reflects concessions provided to the customer such as discounts, rebates and refunds, any potential bonuses receivable from the customer and any other contingent events. Such estimates are determined using either the 'expected value' or 'most likely amount' method. The measurement of variable consideration is subject to a constraining principle whereby revenue will only be recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur. The measurement constraint continues until the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Amounts received that are subject to the constraining principle are recognised as a refund liability. During the year, variable consideration comprised of immaterial discounts to certain customers.

# Revenue from services

Revenue from a contract to provide services is recognised over time for all live captioning, as customers simultaneously receive and consume captioning services as live captioned events occur. All recorded captioning is recognised at a point in time, at such time that the customers gains control of and derives the benefits from the completed captioned medium(s) produced and incurs the obligation to pay for completed captioning. Revenue from services primarily have payment terms of 30-60 days.

# Hardware

Revenue from a contract to provide goods (computer hardware, parts, and hardware rentals) are recognized based on the Incoterm Ex works which is a shipping arrangement where the seller makes product available for pick up at a specific location and the buyer pays for the transport costs. The goods are picked up for delivery and loaded into the carrier's vehicle which is when the title, risks and rewards pass from the seller to the buyer, and it is when the company invoices the client.

# Ai-Media Technologies Limited

# Notes to the consolidated financial statements

# 30 June 2023

# Note 2. Significant accounting policies (continued)

# Software as a Service

Software as a service (SaaS) are electronically delivered software that are categorized as single contract for services or multiple deliverable arrangements depending on the terms of the license or subscription. Revenue is recognised either proportionally over the term of the license or subscription agreement, which is when the stand-alone performance obligation(s) are satisfied, or at the point of consumption, when the service is delivered based on usage.

# Interest

Interest revenue is recognised as interest accrues using the effective interest method. This is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset and allocating the interest income over the relevant period using the effective interest rate, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.

# Other revenue

Other revenue is recognised when it is received or when the right to receive payment is established. Other income is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group is expected to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer.

# Grant income

Grants from the government are recognised at their fair value when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and that the Group will comply with all attached conditions. Government grants relating to costs are deferred and recognised in profit or loss as other income over the periods necessary to match them with the costs that they are intended to compensate.

# Contract assets and liabilities

AASB 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers' uses the terms 'contract asset' and 'contract liability' to describe what is commonly known as 'accrued revenue' and 'deferred revenue'. Contract assets represent the Group's right to consideration for services provided to customers for which the Group's right remains conditional on something other than the passage of time. Contract liabilities arise where payment is received prior to work being performed. Contract assets and contract liabilities are recognised and measured in accordance with this accounting policy.

# Income tax

The income tax expense or benefit for the period is the tax payable on that period's taxable income based on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction, adjusted by the changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences, unused tax losses and the adjustment recognised for prior periods, where applicable.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences at the tax rates expected to be applied when the assets are recovered or liabilities are settled, based on those tax rates that are enacted or substantively enacted, except for:

- When the deferred income tax asset or liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting nor taxable profits; or  
- When the taxable temporary difference is associated with interests in subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures, and the timing of the reversal can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses.

The carrying amount of recognised and unrecognised deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date. Deferred tax assets recognised are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that future taxable profits will be available for the carrying amount to be recovered. Previously unrecognised deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that there are future taxable profits available to recover the asset.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and deferred tax assets against deferred tax liabilities; and they relate to the same taxable authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities which intend to settle simultaneously.

# Ai-Media Technologies Limited Notes to the consolidated financial statements 30 June 2023

# Note 2. Significant accounting policies (continued)

Ai-Media Technologies Limited (the 'head entity') and its wholly-owned Australian subsidiaries have formed an income tax consolidated group under the tax consolidation regime. The head entity and each subsidiary in the tax consolidated group continue to account for their own current and deferred tax amounts. The tax consolidated group has applied the 'separate taxpayer within group' approach in determining the appropriate amount of taxes to allocate to members of the tax consolidated group.

In addition to its own current and deferred tax amounts, the head entity also recognises the current tax liabilities (or assets) and the deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses and unused tax credits assumed from each subsidiary in the tax consolidated group.

Assets or liabilities arising under tax funding agreements with the tax consolidated entities are recognised as amounts receivable from or payable to other entities in the tax consolidated group. The tax funding arrangement ensures that the intercompany charge equals the current tax liability or benefit of each tax consolidated group member, resulting in neither a contribution by the head entity to the subsidiaries nor a distribution by the subsidiaries to the head entity.

# Research and development (R&D) grant

The Group has exceeded the $20 million ATO threshold to claim the refundable R&D tax credit, the non-refundable R&D credits are accounted through income tax expense/benefit for the financial year.

# Current and non-current classification

Assets and liabilities are presented in the statement of financial position based on current and non-current classification.

An asset is classified as current when: it is either expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in the Group's normal operating cycle; it is held primarily for the purpose of trading; it is expected to be realised within 12 months after the reporting period; or the asset is cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period. All other assets are classified as non-current.

A liability is classified as current when: it is either expected to be settled in the Group's normal operating cycle; it is held primarily for the purpose of trading; it is due to be settled within 12 months after the reporting period; or there is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period. All other liabilities are classified as non-current.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are always classified as non-current.

# Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

# Trade and other receivables

Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any allowance for expected credit losses.

Contract receivables represent receivables in respect of which the Group's right to consideration is unconditional subject only to the passage of time. Contract receivables are non-derivative financial assets accounted for in accordance with the Group's accounting policy for non-derivative financial assets for expected credit losses. Trade receivables are generally due for settlement within 30-60 days.

The Group has applied the simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses, which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on days overdue.

Other receivables are recognised at amortised cost, less any allowance for expected credit losses.

# Inventories

Finished goods are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value on a weighted average cost basis. Cost comprises of purchase and delivery costs, net of rebates and discounts received or receivable.

# Ai-Media Technologies Limited

# Notes to the consolidated financial statements

# 30 June 2023

# Note 2. Significant accounting policies (continued)

# Property, plant and equipment

Plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis to write off the net cost of each item of property, plant and equipment (excluding land) over their expected useful lives as follows:

Buildings

Leasehold improvements

Plant and equipment

30 years

Over the lease term

3 to 5 years

The residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date.

Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the unexpired period of the lease or the estimated useful life of the assets, whichever is shorter.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when there is no future economic benefit to the Group. Gains and losses between the carrying amount and the disposal proceeds are taken to profit or loss.

# Right-of-use assets

A right-of-use asset is recognised at the commencement date of a lease. The right-of-use asset is measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability, adjusted for, as applicable, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date net of any lease incentives received, any initial direct costs incurred, and, except where included in the cost of inventories, an estimate of costs expected to be incurred for dismantling and removing the underlying asset, and restoring the site or asset.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the unexpired period of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset, whichever is the shorter. Where the Group expects to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the depreciation is over its estimated useful life. Right-of use assets are subject to impairment or adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities.

The Group has elected not to recognise a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability for short-term leases with terms of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. Lease payments on these assets are expensed to profit or loss as incurred.

# Intangible assets

Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination, other than goodwill, are initially measured at their fair value at the date of the acquisition. Intangible assets acquired separately are initially recognised at cost. Indefinite life intangible assets are not amortised and are subsequently measured at cost less any impairment. Finite life intangible assets are subsequently measured at cost less amortisation and any impairment. The gains or losses recognised in profit or loss arising from the derecognition of intangible assets are measured as the difference between net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the intangible asset. The method and useful lives of finite life intangible assets are reviewed annually. Changes in the expected pattern of consumption or useful life are accounted for prospectively by changing the amortisation method or period.

# Goodwill

Goodwill arises on the acquisition of a business and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are taken to profit or loss and are not subsequently reversed.

# Development

Development costs are capitalised when: it is probable that the project will be a success considering its commercial and technical feasibility; the Group is able to use or sell the asset; the Group has sufficient resources and intent to complete the development; and its costs can be measured reliably. Capitalised development costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of their expected benefit, being their finite life of 4 years.

# Intellectual property

Significant costs associated with intellectual property are deferred and amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of its expected benefit, being its finite life of 10 years.

# Ai-Media Technologies Limited Notes to the consolidated financial statements 30 June 2023

# Note 2. Significant accounting policies (continued)

# Brand name and trademarks

Brand name and trademarks arise on the acquisition of a business and are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Brand name and trademarks are assessed to have indefinite lives as there is no indication that the useful life of the asset will end in the reasonably foreseeable future and there is no way to reliably determine when the assets will cease having economic value.

# Customer contracts

Customer contracts acquired in a business combination are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of their expected benefit, being their finite life of 10 years.

As a component of the ACS, CaptionAccess, Caption IT acquisition assessment, the management of the company has undertaken a comprehensive review of the customer contracts. Subsequently, there has been a revision in the useful life assigned to these customer contracts. It is now anticipated that the amortization process for these contracts will be completed by the conclusion of FY25. This adjustment reflects our commitment to accurate and prudent accounting practices.

During the financial year, the Group completed an assessment of the useful lives of these customer contracts and revised the estimated useful life from ten years to five years. This change in accounting estimate will be effective 1 July 2022. Based on the carrying amount of these customer contracts included in 'Intangibles' as of 30 June 2023, it is estimated this change will increase loss for the year by $413,873.

# Software

Significant costs associated with software are deferred and amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of its expected benefit, being its finite life, which varies from 7 to 10 years.

# Impairment of non-financial assets

Goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired. Other non-financial assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.

Recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs of disposal and value-in-use. The value-in-use is the present value of the estimated future cash flows relating to the asset using a pre-tax discount rate specific to the asset or cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Assets that do not have independent cash flows are grouped together to form a cash-generating unit.

# Trade and other payables

Trade and other payables represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of the financial year and which are unpaid. Due to their short-term nature they are measured at amortised cost and are not discounted. The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days of recognition.

# Borrowings

Loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, net of transaction costs. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

# Lease liabilities

A lease liability is recognised at the commencement date of a lease. The lease liability is initially recognised at the present value of the lease payments to be made over the term of the lease, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group's incremental borrowing rate. Lease payments comprise of fixed payments less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option when the exercise of the option is reasonably certain to occur, and any anticipated termination penalties. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.

# Ai-Media Technologies Limited

# Notes to the consolidated financial statements

# 30 June 2023

# Note 2. Significant accounting policies (continued)

Lease liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The carrying amounts are remeasured if there is a change in the following: future lease payments arising from a change in an index or a rate used; residual guarantee; lease term; certainty of a purchase option and termination penalties. When a lease liability is remeasured, an adjustment is made to the corresponding right-of use asset, or to profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is fully written down.

# Finance costs

Finance costs attributable to qualifying assets are capitalised as part of the asset. All other finance costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.

# Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present (legal or constructive) obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable the Group will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. If the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate specific to the liability. The increase in the provision resulting from the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.

# Employee benefits

# Short-term employee benefits

Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits, annual leave and long service leave expected to be settled wholly within 12 months of the reporting date are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled.

# Other long-term employee benefits

The liability for annual leave and long service leave not expected to be settled within 12 months of the reporting date are measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service. Expected future payments are discounted using market yields at the reporting date on high quality corporate bonds with terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows.

# Defined contribution superannuation expense

Contributions to defined contribution superannuation plans are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.

# Share-based payments

Equity-settled and cash-settled share-based compensation benefits are provided to employees.

Equity-settled transactions are awards of shares, or options over shares, that are provided to employees in exchange for the rendering of services.

The cost of equity-settled transactions are measured at fair value on grant date. Fair value is independently determined using either the Binomial or Black-Scholes option pricing model that takes into account the exercise price, the term of the option, the impact of dilution, the share price at grant date and expected price volatility of the underlying share, the expected dividend yield and the risk free interest rate for the term of the option, together with non-vesting conditions that do not determine whether the Group receives the services that entitle the employees to receive payment. No account is taken of any other vesting conditions.

The cost of equity-settled transactions are recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity over the vesting period. The cumulative charge to profit or loss is calculated based on the grant date fair value of the award, the best estimate of the number of awards that are likely to vest and the expired portion of the vesting period. The amount recognised in profit or loss for the period is the cumulative amount calculated at each reporting date less amounts already recognised in previous periods.

Market conditions are taken into consideration in determining fair value. Therefore, any awards subject to market conditions are considered to vest irrespective of whether or not that market condition has been met, provided all other conditions are satisfied.

# Ai-Media Technologies Limited Notes to the consolidated financial statements 30 June 2023

# Note 2. Significant accounting policies (continued)

If equity-settled awards are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the modification has not been made. An additional expense is recognised, over the remaining vesting period, for any modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based compensation benefit as at the date of modification.

If the non-vesting condition is within the control of the Group or employee, the failure to satisfy the condition is treated as a cancellation. If the condition is not within the control of the Group or employee and is not satisfied during the vesting period, any remaining expense for the award is recognised over the remaining vesting period, unless the award is forfeited.

If equity-settled awards are cancelled, they are treated as if they had vested on the date of cancellation, and any remaining expense is recognised immediately. If a new replacement award is substituted for the cancelled award, the cancelled and new award is treated as if they were a modification.

# Fair value measurement

When an asset or liability, financial or non-financial, is measured at fair value for recognition or disclosure purposes, the fair value is based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date; and assumes that the transaction will take place either: in the principal market; or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market.

Fair value is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming they act in their economic best interests. For non-financial assets, the fair value measurement is based on its highest and best use. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value are those that are appropriate in the circumstances and which maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs.

# Issued capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity.

Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

# Business combinations

The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations regardless of whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired.

The consideration transferred is the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred, equity instruments issued or liabilities incurred by the acquirer to former owners of the acquiree and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. For each business combination, the non-controlling interest in the acquiree is measured at either fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. All acquisition costs are expensed as incurred to profit or loss.

On the acquisition of a business, the Group assesses the financial assets acquired and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic conditions, the Group's operating or accounting policies and other pertinent conditions in existence at the acquisition-date.

Where the business combination is achieved in stages, the Group remeasures its previously held equity interest in the acquiree at the acquisition-date fair value and the difference between the fair value and the previous carrying amount is recognised in profit or loss.

Contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognised at the acquisition-date fair value. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability is recognised in profit or loss. Contingent consideration classified as equity is not remeasured and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.

The difference between the acquisition-date fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the consideration transferred and the fair value of any pre-existing investment in the acquiree is recognised as goodwill. If the consideration transferred and the pre-existing fair value is less than the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired, being a bargain purchase to the acquirer, the difference is recognised as a gain directly in profit or loss by the acquirer on the acquisition-date, but only after a reassessment of the identification and measurement of the net assets acquired, the non-controlling interest in the acquiree, if any, the consideration transferred and the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquirer.

# Notes to the consolidated financial statements

# 30 June 2023

# Note 2. Significant accounting policies (continued)

# Earnings per share

# Basic earnings per share

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the owners of Ai-Media Technologies Limited, excluding any costs of servicing equity other than ordinary shares, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year, adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary shares issued during the financial year.

# Diluted earnings per share

Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account the after income tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares and the weighted average number of additional ordinary shares that would have been outstanding assuming conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.

# Goods and Services Tax (GST) and other similar taxes

Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of associated GST, unless the GST incurred is not recoverable from the tax authority. In this case it is recognised as part of the cost of the acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense.

Receivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST receivable or payable. The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the tax authority is included in other receivables or other payables in the statement of financial position.

Cash flows are presented on a gross basis. The GST components of cash flows arising from investing or financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to the tax authority, are presented as operating cash flows.

Commitments and contingencies are disclosed net of the amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the tax authority.

# New Accounting Standards and Interpretations not yet mandatory or early adopted

Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations that have recently been issued or amended but are not yet mandatory, have not been early adopted by the Group for the annual reporting period ended 30 June 2023. The Group has assessed that there will be no significant impact on adoption of these new or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations. The new or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations, most relevant to the Group, are set out below.

# AASB 2020-1 Amendments to AASs – Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current

These amendments are applicable for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. These amendments to AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements clarify the requirements for classifying liabilities as current or non-current. The amendments specify that the conditions which exist at the end of the reporting period are those which will be used to determine if a right to defer settlement of a liability exists. These amendments are applied retrospectively. Earlier application is permitted.

# AASB 2021-2 Amendments to AASB 108 – Definition of Accounting Estimates

These amendments are applicable for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. These amendments to AASB 108 clarify the definition of an accounting estimate, making it easier to differentiate it from an accounting policy. The distinction is necessary as their treatment and disclosure requirements are different. Critically, a change in an accounting estimate is applied prospectively whereas a change in an accounting policy is generally applied retrospectively. The new definition states that 'Accounting estimates are monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty. The amendments are applied prospectively. Earlier application is permitted.

# Note 3. Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions

The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements. Management continually evaluates its judgements and estimates in relation to assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities, revenue and expenses. Management bases its judgements, estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on other various factors, including expectations of future events, management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.

# Ai-Media Technologies Limited Notes to the consolidated financial statements 30 June 2023

# Note 3. Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions (continued)

Judgement has been exercised in considering the impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic has had, or may have, on the Group based on known information. This consideration extends to the nature of the products and services offered, customers, supply chain, staffing and geographic regions in which the Group operates. Other than as addressed in specific notes, there does not currently appear to be either any significant impact upon the financial statements or any significant uncertainties with respect to events or conditions which may impact the Group unfavourably as at the reporting date or subsequently as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic

The resulting accounting judgements and estimates will seldom equal the related actual results. The judgements, estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities (refer to the respective notes) within the next financial year are discussed below.

# Best estimate judgements on present obligations

The amount recognised as a provision shall be the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period. Management take into account the probability weighting of the most likely outcome when recognising provisions which involves key judgements.

# Estimation of useful lives of assets

The Group determines the estimated useful lives and related depreciation and amortisation charges for its property, plant and equipment and finite life intangible assets. The useful lives could change significantly as a result of technical innovations or some other event. The depreciation and amortisation charge will increase where the useful lives are less than previously estimated lives, or technically obsolete or non-strategic assets that have been abandoned or sold will be written off or written down.

# Goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets

The Group tests annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment, whether goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets have suffered any impairment in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note 2.

# Recovery of deferred tax assets

Deferred tax assets are recognised when the Group believes it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available for utilizing tax losses and deductible temporary differences. Currently, the group holds notable tax losses and Research and Development credit balances in Australia and its overseas entities. The projected sustained profitability in Australia over the forthcoming years is expected to facilitate the utilisation of these Deferred Tax Assets (DTA), attributed in part to recent modifications in corporate recharge strategies and the inclusion of intercompany loan interest.

# Note 4. Operating segments

# Identification of reportable operating segments

The Group is organised into 3 operating segments based on geographical locations: Australia and New Zealand (ANZ), North America (which includes Canada and United States of America), and Rest of the world (ROW) (which includes United Kingdom, Singapore and Malaysia). These operating segments are based on the internal reports that are reviewed and used by the Board of Directors (who are identified as the Chief Operating Decision Makers (CODM) in assessing performance and in determining the allocation of resources. There is no aggregation of operating segments.

The CODM reviews EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation). The accounting policies adopted for internal reporting to the CODM are consistent with those adopted in the financial statements.

The information reported to the CODM is on a monthly basis.

The CODM does not regularly review segment assets and segment liabilities. Refer to statement of financial position for assets and liabilities.

# Major customers

During the year 30 June 2023 and 30 June 2022, there were no customers exceeding  $10\%$  of the Group's revenue.

* Group has reassessed the ability of its foreign subsidiaries to generate taxable income and has derecognised the carried forward tax losses in the current year.  
** The Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset on unused tax losses (revenue in nature) as deductible temporary differences in jurisdictions where the group does not expect to have taxable income.

As the Group's aggregated turnover is above $50 million at the end of the 2021-22 income year, it is no longer a base rate entity. Therefore, the applicable corporate tax rate for the 2021-2022 income year is  $30\%$ . The Company has remeasured its deferred tax balances, and any unrecognised potential tax benefits arising from carried forward tax losses, based on the effective tax rate that is expected to apply in the year the temporary differences are expected to reverse or benefits from tax losses realised. The impact of the change in tax rate on deferred tax balances has been recognised as tax expense in profit or loss or as an adjustment to equity to the extent to which the deferred tax relates to items previously recognised outside profit or loss.

# Impairment test for goodwill

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group's cash generating units (CGU), or groups of CGUs, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combinations. Each unit or groups of units to which goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level at which assets are monitored for internal management purposes.

# Ai-Media Technologies Limited

# Notes to the consolidated financial statements

30 June 2023

# Note 16. Intangibles (continued)

The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to the CGUs as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan="3"></td><td colspan="2">Consolidated</td></tr><tr><td>2023</td><td>2022</td></tr><tr><td>$</td><td>$</td></tr><tr><td>North America</td><td>45,089,767</td><td>42,889,320</td></tr><tr><td>ROW</td><td>447,619</td><td>389,434</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>45,537,386</td><td>43,278,754</td></tr></table>

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. Based on the growth experienced in the ROW CGU and impairment test conducted in EMEA, no impairment of goodwill has been identified. The goodwill associated with the North America CGU, arose through the ACS, CaptionAccess, Caption IT and EEG acquisitions. Subsequent to the acquisition, the subsidiaries continued to operate ahead of expectations and the Group is benefiting from the synergies of the combination in the North America CGU.

The directors have assessed the recoverable amount of the North America CGU, using discount cash flow model, is in excess of the carrying amount. The model used a discount rate of  $12\%$  (2022:  $8\%$ ), an average growth rate of  $9\%$  (2022:  $27\%$ ) for the next 5 years and a terminal growth rate of  $3\%$  (2022:  $3\%$ ).

Despite the absence of goodwill in the Australia CGU, the management proceeded to assess the recoverable amount of the Australia CGU, ensuring that it exceeded the carrying amount of its assets. The model used a discount rate of  $12\%$  (2022:  $8\%$ ), an average growth rate of  $3\%$  (2022:  $13\%$ ) for the next 5 years and a terminal growth rate of  $3\%$  (2022:  $3\%$ ). The evaluation of the recoverable amount, conducted using a discounted cash flow model, revealed a headroom over the carrying amount of the assets.

# Sensitivity analysis

The Group has conducted an analysis of the sensitivity of the impairment test to changes in the key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for each of the group of CGUs to which goodwill is allocated.

On management assumptions, sensitivities are applied to the value-in-use calculations with the associated headroom as set out below. Further sensitivities are applied to the value-in-use calculations with the associated headroom as set out below. These are considered to be reasonably possible, but not likely.

- Increase in the discount rate by  $1\% - 2\%$  on FY24 budgets; and  
- Reduction in revenue growth rates on FY24 budgets by 2-4% (US) / 1-2% (AU) / 5-10% (ROW); and  
- Terminal value growth rate of  $2\%$ .

The directors believe that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would not cause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed the aggregate recoverable amount of the related CGUs.

The provision represents the present value of the estimated costs to make good the premises leased by the Group at the end of the respective lease terms.

# Other payables from acquisitions

A USD 4,968,000 (AUD 7,493,213) earn-out payment for the purchase of EEG is due on 29 September 2023 (this includes an additional USD 92,000 not accrued as at 30 June 2023) and a deferred liability of USD 280,000 (AUD 422,323) will be settled in cash instead of the FY23 Restricted Stock Unit plan as part of the ACS acquisition. The other payables from acquisitions is considered as a contractual liability and is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

# Other provisions

Other provisions represent the best estimate of a tax provision associated with the share based payment plan of  $550,000 and for other indirect taxes in a foreign subsidiary amounting to$ 40,941.

# Note 21. Provisions (continued)

# Annual leave and long service leave

The current portion of provision for employee benefits includes the total amount accrued for annual leave entitlements and the amounts accrued for long service leave entitlements that have vested due to employees having completed the required year of service. Based on past experience, the company does not expect the full amount of annual leave balances classified as current provisions to be settled within the next 12 months. However, these amounts must be classified as current, since the company does not have an unconditional right to defer the settlement of these amounts in the event employees wish to use their leave entitlement.

# Ordinary shares

Ordinary shares entitle the holder to participate in any dividends declared and any proceeds attributable to shareholders should the Company be wound up in proportions that consider both the number of shares held and the extent to which those shares are paid up. The fully paid ordinary shares have no par value and the Company does not have a limited amount of authorised capital.

On a show of hands every member present at a meeting in person or by proxy shall have one vote and upon a poll each share shall have one vote.

# Share buy-back

There is no current on-market share buy-back.

# Capital risk management

The Group's objectives when managing capital is to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimum capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

Capital is regarded as total equity, as recognised in the statement of financial position, plus net debt. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.

The Group would look to raise capital when an opportunity to invest in a business or company was seen as value adding relative to the current Company's share price at the time of the investment. The Group is not actively pursuing additional investments in the short term as it continues to integrate and grow its existing businesses in order to maximise synergies.

The capital risk management policy remains unchanged from the 30 June 2022 Annual Report.

# Notes to the consolidated financial statements

# Note 25. Financial instruments

# Financial risk management objectives

The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign currency risk, price risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group's overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group.

Risk management is carried out by senior finance executives (Finance) under frameworks approved by the Board of Directors (the Board). These frameworks include identification and analysis of the risk exposure of the Group and appropriate procedures, controls and risk limits.

# Market risk

# Foreign currency risk

The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currency and is exposed to foreign currency risk through foreign exchange rate fluctuations.

Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions and recognised financial assets and financial liabilities denominated in a currency that is not the entity's functional currency. The risk is measured using sensitivity analysis and cash flow forecasting.

The carrying amount of the Group's foreign currency denominated financial assets and financial liabilities before intercompany eliminations at the reporting date were as follows:

<table><tr><td></td><td colspan="2">Assets</td><td colspan="2">Liabilities</td></tr><tr><td>Consolidated</td><td>2023$</td><td>2022$</td><td>2023$</td><td>2022$</td></tr><tr><td>Pound sterling</td><td>5,355,708</td><td>7,143,152</td><td>10,465,055</td><td>9,802,482</td></tr><tr><td>Canadian dollars</td><td>9,653,252</td><td>6,411,621</td><td>5,643,594</td><td>12,848,365</td></tr><tr><td>Singapore dollars</td><td>1,528,894</td><td>1,749,490</td><td>2,674,505</td><td>2,208,223</td></tr><tr><td>US dollars</td><td>63,357,546</td><td>43,870,696</td><td>120,712,524</td><td>90,832,727</td></tr><tr><td>Malaysian ringgit</td><td>729,326</td><td>64,926</td><td>774,615</td><td>482,596</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>80,624,726</td><td>59,239,885</td><td>140,270,293</td><td>116,174,393</td></tr></table>

The Group had net liabilities denominated in foreign currencies of $59,645,567 (assets of $80,624,726 less liabilities of $140,270,293) as at 30 June 2023 (2022: $56,934,508 (assets of $59,239,885 less liabilities of $116,174,393)). Based on this exposure, had the Australian dollars weakened by 5%/strengthened by 5% (2022: weakened by 5%/strengthened by 5%) against these foreign currencies with all other variables held constant, the Group's profit before tax for the year would have been $306,287 lower/$306,287 higher (2022: $286,037 lower/$286,037 higher) and equity would have been $214,401 lower/$214,401 higher (2022: $200,226 lower/$200,226 higher). The percentage change is the expected overall volatility of the significant currencies, which is based on management's assessment of reasonable possible fluctuations taking into consideration movements over the last 12 months each year and the spot rate at each reporting date. The actual foreign exchange gain for the year ended 30 June 2023 was $149,314 (2022: loss of $50,223).

# Price risk

The Group is not exposed to any significant price risk.

# Interest rate risk

The Group's financial performance can be impacted by current and future economic conditions which it cannot control, such as increases in interest rates and inflation. The Group has no short or long-term borrowings thus, the Group is not exposed to any significant interest rate risk.

# Credit risk

Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. The Group has a strict code of credit, confirming references and setting appropriate credit limits. The Group obtains guarantees where appropriate to mitigate credit risk. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date to recognised financial assets is the carrying amount, net of any provisions for impairment of those assets, as disclosed in the statement of financial position and notes to the financial statements. The Group does not hold any collateral.

# Ai-Media Technologies Limited Notes to the consolidated financial statements 30 June 2023

# Note 25. Financial instruments (continued)

The Group has adopted a lifetime expected loss allowance in estimating expected credit losses to trade receivables through the use of a provisions matrix using fixed rates of credit loss provisioning. These provisions are considered representative across all customers of the Group based on recent sales experience, historical collection rates and forward-looking information that is available.

Trade receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Indicators of this include the failure of a debtor to engage in a repayment plan, no active enforcement activity and a failure to make contractual payments for a period greater than 1 year.

# Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk requires the Group to maintain sufficient liquid assets (mainly cash and cash equivalents) to be able to pay debts as and when they become due and payable.

The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves by continuously monitoring actual and forecast cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.

# Remaining contractual maturities

The following tables detail the Group's remaining contractual maturity for its financial instrument liabilities. The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the financial liabilities are required to be paid. The tables include both interest and principal cash flows disclosed as remaining contractual maturities (except as noted below) and therefore these totals may differ from their carrying amount in the statement of financial position.

# Note 35. Share-based payments

# Restricted Share Units (RSUs)

The Company agreed to grant each Non-Executive Directors RSUs to the value of $25,000 per annum for each of the first 3 financial years following the IPO. The first tranche of the 60,705 RSUs was vested and convertible into fully paid ordinary shares of the Company at 30 June 2021 based on the Offer Price under the IPO. The second tranche of 70,391 RSUs was vested as at 30 June 2022 and converted into fully paid ordinary shares of the Company on 7 July 2022. The third tranche of 293,916 RSUs was vested and not yet converted into fully paid ordinary shares of the Company as at 30 June 2023.

In determining the fair value at grant date of restricted share units, reference was made to the value of the share-based payment entitlement of  $25,000. A valuation model was not required and no further inputs were considered necessary since the entitlement at grant date has been fixed at$ 25,000.

On 20 December 2021, the Company granted RSUs to ex-ACS employees as part of the acquisition of ACS. 125,061 RSUs were vested and converted into fully paid ordinary shares of the company on 1 February 2022 based on the offer price under the IPO to the value of $153,824. The second tranche of 252,968 RSUs vested and converted into fully paid ordinary shares of the company on 20 December 2022 amounted to $72,485. The third tranche of $75,091 worth of RSUs were not issued as at 30 June 2023.

On 17 December 2021, 6,766,136 RSUs were granted. These RSUs did not meet the vesting conditions, performance and RTSR hurdles and have therefore lapsed. No expenses in relation to the RSUs have been recorded in the financial year ended 30 June 2022.

The share-based payment expense in relation to RSUs for 2023 is  $125,803 (2022:$ 307,994).

# Independent Auditor's Report to the members of Ai-Media Technologies Limited

Report on the Audit of the Financial Report

# Opinion

We have audited the financial report of Ai-Media Technologies Limited (the "Company") and its subsidiaries (the "Group") which comprises the consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2023, the consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including material accounting policy information and other explanatory information, and the directors' declaration.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial report of the Group is in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, including:

- Giving a true and fair view of the Group's financial position as at 30 June 2023 and of its financial performance for the year then ended; and  
- Complying with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Regulations 2001.

# Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional & Ethical Standards Board's APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the Code) that are relevant to our audit of the financial report in Australia. We have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.

We confirm that the independence declaration required by the Corporations Act 2001, which has been given to the directors of the Company, would be in the same terms if given to the directors as at the time of this auditor's report.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

# Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial report for the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Liability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation.

Member of Deloitte Asia Pacific Limited and the Deloitte organisation.

# Deloitte.

<table><tr><td>Key Audit Matter</td><td>How the scope of our audit responded to the Key Audit Matter</td></tr><tr><td>Recoverability of deferred tax asset
As at 30 June 2023, the Australian tax consolidated group has recognised a net deferred tax asset of $6m (30 June 2022: $7.26m). The Group has significant carry forward tax losses and unutilised tax credits in Australia and some other jurisdictions incurred in prior years.
The Group can only recognise a deferred tax asset arising from unused tax losses or tax credits to the extent that the Group has taxable temporary differences or there is convincing other evidence that sufficient future taxable income will be derived. Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of the deferred tax asset that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the amount of future taxable profits.
Accordingly, the recognition and recoverability of the deferred tax asset is a key audit matter for the year ended 30 June 2023.</td><td>In consultation with our tax specialists, our procedures included, but were not limited to:
• Understood and tested the design and implementation of key controls over the models used to assess the recoverability of the deferred tax asset;
• Assessed the accuracy of the deferred tax calculation prepared by management and reviewed applicable tax regulation;
• Evaluated the reasonableness of the operating budgets approved by the Directors where applicable, including an assessment of forecasting accuracy and assessed the reasonableness of assumptions used in management&#x27;s estimate;
• Recalculated the accuracy of the deferred tax calculation; and
• Assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures included in Note 8 of the financial statements.</td></tr><tr><td>Recoverability of goodwill
As at 30 June 2023, the Group has goodwill a mounting to $45.54m reflected in the balance sheet.
Where a cash generating unit (&quot;CGU&quot;) contains goodwill, management conducts annual impairment tests (or more frequently if impairment indicators exist) to assess the recoverable amount of goodwill. This assessment is performed through the preparation of discounted cash flow model.
The evaluation of the recoverable amount requires significant judgement by management in determining the key assumptions supporting the forecast cash flows of each CGU including:
• Forecast EBITDA;
• Long term growth rate; and
• Appropriate discount rate.</td><td>In consultation with our valuation specialists, our audit procedures included, but were not limited to the following:
• Evaluated management&#x27;s identification of each CGU to which goodwill is allocated;
• Reviewed and critically challenged management&#x27;s assessment of impairment indicators;
• Understood and tested the design and implementation of key controls over the determination of recoverable amounts of each CGU and comparing this to the carrying value of the CGU&#x27;s assets;
• Assessed the appropriateness of management&#x27;s recoverable amount calculations using a discounted cashflow model for each CGU;
• Challenged the key assumptions and estimates used by management, including analysing growth rates and performing an independent calculation of the discount rates;
• Agreed inputs used in the model to forecasts approved by the Directors, where applicable;</td></tr></table>

# Other Information

The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Group's annual report for the year ended 30 June 2023, but does not include the financial report and our auditor's report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial report, or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Report

The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

# Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.

# Deloitte.

As part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.  
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.  
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.  
- Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.  
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the disclosures, and whether the financial report represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.  
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group's audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial report of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# Report on the Remuneration Report

Opinion on the Remuneration Report
