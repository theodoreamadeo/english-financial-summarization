Welcome to this year's Annual Report, my first as Metcash Chairman. It is very pleasing to report that the Group has delivered another record year, and one that represents continued progress on the outstanding results in the prior two years.

Underlying earnings per share increased  $6.4\%$  to 31.8 cents

$\trianglesim 46 \%$  over 3 years

Dividends increased ~5% to 22.5 cps fully franked

$\triangle 80 \%$  over 3 years

Growth momentum continued in our Food, Hardware and Liquor pillars driven by strong demand, the success of our strategic initiatives and the contribution from acquisitions.

# FINANCIAL RESULTS

Group reported revenue, which excludes charge-through sales, increased \(6.2\%\) to \(15.8bn. Including charge- through sales, Group revenue increased \(5.7\%\) to exceed \(\$ 18\)bn for the first time, and underlying profit after tax was up \(4.6\%\) to a record \(\$ 308\)m. The last three years have seen extraordinary growth for Metcash, with Group revenue up \(29\%\) and earnings growing more than \(50\%\).

The continued strong performance is testament to the improved competitiveness of our retail networks and their dedication to serving their local communities, as well as the passion and commitment of our Metcash teams who are truly living our purpose of Championing Successful Independents.

Underlying earnings per share increased  $6.4\%$  to 31.8 cents per share, an increase of  $45.9\%$  over the three years. The lift in earnings and strong financial position of Metcash led to dividends for FY23 increasing  $\sim 5\%$  to 22.5 cents per share fully franked, which is an increase of  $80\%$  over the three years. Total distributions to shareholders are a substantial  $\$ 800$ m over the same period. Group CEO, Doug Jones will discuss the Company’s performance in more detail in his Report.

# STRATEGY

At the core of our strategy is to further improve the competitiveness of our independent retail networks. This includes continuing to improve the quality and value of the offer to shoppers, and in strengthening and growing our own, and our network's, capabilities to deliver value to our retailers and suppliers. Our focus on both the shopper and retailer helps grow sales volumes, which is the key driver of Metcash's flywheel and underpins our competitive advantages and performance.

We remain committed to investing in growth and have a significant and expanding pipeline of opportunities across our pillars, and particularly in Hardware. The acquisition of Total Tools and expansion of our network of joint venture and Company-owned stores have been a real success and present further opportunities. All capital investments are assessed though a disciplined process that includes consideration of the investment's strategic fit and ability to meet our financial return hurdles.

# REMUNERATION AND CULTURE

Following the outcome of our annual benchmarking study by remuneration specialists Aon, modest fixed pay increases were awarded to the Hardware and Liquor pillar CEOs to maintain their position at the market medians. There was no change to fixed pay for the Group CEO.

Short-Term Incentive (STI) outcomes for Key Management Personnel (KMP) continued to be based on pool and scorecard results and ranged from  $65\%$  to  $84\%$  of the maximum potential reward. This reflects the delivery of outstanding results in FY23.

The year included a review of our STI deferral practices and, commencing in FY24, we are increasing the STI deferral component for the Group CEO from  $33\%$  to  $40\%$ , with a further increase to  $50\%$  in FY25. The Group CFO's deferral component lifts from  $25\%$  to  $33\%$  in FY24, then to  $40\%$  in FY25 and  $50\%$  in FY26. These changes are to align with market best practice and to align the interests of our most senior executives with those of our shareholders.

Our FY21 Long-Term Incentive (LTI) vested this year at  $100\%$ . The Return on Funds Employed outcome was  $\sim 30\%$ , and the Absolute Total Shareholder Return outcome was  $21\%$  which reflects growth of  $\sim 75\%$  in our share price and dividends over the three-year performance period.

We continued to focus on maintaining our excellent record of paying equitably across the Metcash Group. Our gender pay gap was maintained at  $\sim 1\%$  and we were again awarded a citation as Employer of Choice by the Workplace Gender Equality Agency, recognising our commitment to gender pay parity and equality.

Workplace engagement and culture continues to be a key focus for us, and it was pleasing to see a further improvement in our engagement survey results. This year we were placed in the 71st percentile of internationally benchmarked companies (FY22: 62nd percentile) for salaried employees.

Further details on our remuneration framework and FY23 outcomes can be found in the Remuneration Report commencing on page 51.

# ENVIRONMENT, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (ESG)

Metcash has an ambitious agenda for lifting its ESG credentials and it was pleasing to see the Company's efforts recognised by Dow Jones in its Sustainability Index assessment. This year Metcash was placed in the 87th percentile of its designated international sector, compared with the 56th percentile two years ago.

Significant progress was made against our ESG plans, including in the key areas of Environment and Climate, Our People and Community and Products.

Our emissions reduced by a further  $5 \%$ , in line with the trajectory of our Paris Agreement-aligned 2030 science-based target for Scope 1 and 2 emissions. From a people perspective, our key safety measure (Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate) improved  $34 \%$ to 19.9; we achieved our 40/40/20 gender diversity target at Board and Senior Management level; and our engagement and culture score improved as I have noted. Donations through the Community Chest program increased  $30 \%$ to $3.1m and over 600,000 meals and 22 tonnes of essential groceries were donated for those in need.

From a reporting perspective, our 2023 Sustainability Report will be aligned to standards in the internationally accepted Global Reporting Index (GRI), and the Taskforce for Climate Change Financial Disclosures (TCFD). This has been made possible through the completion of three years of preparatory work.

A summary of the 2023 Sustainability Report can be found on page 30 of the Annual Report, with the full Sustainability Report available on our website in August.

# The last three years have seen extraordinary growth for Metcash, with Group revenue up  $29\%$  and earnings growth more than  $50\%$ .

# SAFETY AND SUSTAINABILITY COMMITTEE

Recognising the importance of safety and ESG at Metcash, the Board established a separate Safety and Sustainability Committee on 1 May 2023. The Committee is chaired by Christine Holman, with Murray Jordan and me as members. The Committee oversees Metcash's strategy and reporting in these very important areas.

# LEADERSHIP CHANGES (KMP)

In March we announced that Grant Ramage would succeed Scott Marshall as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Food pillar effective 1 May 2023. Scott had been with Metcash for more than 30 years; and with the Food pillar positioned well for the future, believed it was the right time to pursue another career opportunity. Grant was most recently the Food pillar's Executive General Manager Merchandise and, as a member of the Food leadership group, has been a key contributor to the very strong performance of both the Food pillar and IGA network in recent years.

Last month we announced the appointment of Deepa Sita as our new Group Chief Financial Officer (CFO) to succeed Alistair Bell, who had earlier advised of his intention to retire from the role. Deepa is an experienced executive with an extensive career in finance and industry that spans more than 20 years. She is currently CFO of the largest FMCG company in Africa, Tiger Consumer Brands Limited, and was named South Africa's 2022 CFO of the year in the Finance and Technology, and Compliance and Governance categories. Deepa will join Metcash in January 2024.

We have healthy and supportive retail networks and a significant and increasing pipeline of growth opportunities. Our financial position is strong, and we have an experienced management team to continue progressing our growth plans and focus on superior returns for shareholders through the cycle.

# LOOKING FORWARD

While demand continues to be solid in all pillars, the impact of higher interest rates and cost of living has started to impact consumer confidence and the behaviour of some customers and shoppers in our retail networks.

Importantly, Metcash is now much larger, more diversified and stronger than it was three years ago, and our management team and retail networks are experienced at managing well through challenges, including changes to the external environment.

The fundamentals for our businesses remain sound, supported by high employment, increasing population and immigration and continued government investment in infrastructure and housing.

We have healthy and supportive retail networks and a significant and increasing pipeline of growth opportunities. Our financial position is strong, and we have an experienced management team to continue progressing our growth plans and focus on superior returns for shareholders through the cycle.

# THANKS

I would like to thank my fellow Directors for their support to me in my first year as Metcash Chairman, and for their commitment and contribution over the year.

To the Metcash leadership team and all our people, our independent retailers and suppliers, I would like to express my thanks and that of the entire Board for your ongoing support.

# LOCAL STORY

# SUPPORTING

# LOCAL SUPPLIERS

# Mt Evelyn, Victoria

Mt Evelyn IGA is a family run supermarket that has been proudly part of the local community since 1972. Their primary focus is on fulfilling the community's needs and supporting locals wherever possible.

Tony Ingpen has been stocking Melbourne local Chris Barlotta's That's Alotta Donuts in his store for the last couple of years. Chris started the business at 23, after a career-ending basketball injury, with some help from his parents. The business nearly failed during COVID but working with Tony and selling his products through the Mt Evelyn IGA helped not only keep the business afloat but to grow to where it is today. He started selling 100 donuts to the Mt Evelyn IGA every two days, growing quickly to 200 per day. It wasn't long before That's Alotta Donuts were being stocked in multiple IGA stores and Chris was selling 2,000 donuts a day through the network. He now sells 8,000 donuts a day – through the family's own two shops, online, and through the IGA network in Victoria.

This year has been an outstanding one for Metcash and I am pleased to present a very strong set of results for FY23.

Food EBIT $\triangle$ $\sim 4\%$

$\trianglesim 12 \%$ $3 \mathrm{yr}$

Hardware EBIT  $\trianglesim$  17%

$\trianglesim 160 \%$ $3 \mathrm{yr}$

Liquor EBIT  $\trianglesim 9 \%$

43% 3yr

I continue to be both amazed and proud of the passion and enthusiasm shown by our independent retailers in serving their local communities. Our retail networks are predominantly made up of family-owned small businesses, with many of them multi- generational. They provide a differentiated value and unique shopping proposition for their customers and are enormous contributors to local communities and the national economy.

We recently commissioned an independent report to quantify their contribution across the IGA and Foodland retail networks and found they support more than 34,000 local organisations, around 100,000 jobs directly and indirectly and contribute over $8bn annually to the national economy. This enormous contribution would be even greater when adding the impact of our Hardware and Liquor networks.

We believe our independent retailers are a national treasure that should be encouraged and supported. Championing Successful Independents is both our purpose and our strategy; it guides what we do every day. Our team members have done an excellent job in executing our strategies and working with retailers and suppliers to further strengthen and grow our independent retail networks this year.

The ongoing dedication and enthusiasm of our people towards this cause has been a real highlight for me since I joined Metcash just over 18 months ago. I sincerely thank them for the key role they have played and continue to play in delivering our purpose of Championing Successful Independents. Through the combined efforts of our people, retailers and suppliers, our independent retail networks are a competitive and differentiated alternative to larger market players, valued by communities across Australia.

The Metcash strategy has as its primary objectives to be the wholesale and brand partner of choice to independent retailers, and to be the route-to-market partner of choice to suppliers in the food, hardware and liquor sectors. We achieve our strategy through our flywheel, which captures the key competitive advantages that set us apart; at its heart is logistics to support the end-to-end supply chain, next is our strategy to nurture brands and formats that shoppers love to shop in, and independent entrepreneurs want to invest in and run; and finally our support and services to help independents compete with the larger chain stores.

On the strength of our purpose, strategy and flywheel, the year has been an outstanding one for Metcash and I am pleased to present a very strong set of results for FY23. Sales and earnings were both at record levels, our pillar initiatives continued to improve the competitiveness of our retail networks and our strategic acquisitions delivered valuable contributions to performance and drove our growth.

This year's results represent further growth on the exceptional performance in the prior two years. Our three-year growth is substantial with Underlying Profit After Tax up  $\sim 55\%$  and dividends up  $80\%$ . Importantly, the strong performance has been in all pillars and across all retail networks.

# GROUP FINANCIALS

Group reported revenue, which excludes charge-through sales, increased  $6.2\%$  to  $15.8bn (FY22:$ 14.9bn). Including charge-through sales, Group revenue increased  $5.7\%$  to $18.1bn (FY22: $17.1bn), with growth in each pillar building on the strong sales performance over the prior two years.

Group underlying EBIT increased  $8.1\%$  to a record  $\$ 500.8\mathrm{m}$ , with earnings growth in all pillars reflecting continued strong demand, good operating discipline and the success of strategic acquisitions and initiatives. On a three-year basis, Group underlying EBIT increased  $49.5\%$ .

Group underlying profit after tax increased  $4.6\%$  to  $\$ 307.5\text{m}$ , and statutory profit after tax increased  $7.6\%$  to  $\$ 259.0\text{m}$ . Underlying earnings per share increased  $6.4\%$  to 31.8 cents reflecting the increase in profit after tax.

Group operating cashflow was  $372.7m (FY22:$ 432.3m) with a cash realisation ratio of  $\sim 77\%$ . This is below our historical average reflecting additional tax payments, an increase in working capital from a strategic investment in inventory, growth in the Hardware pillar and the adverse impact of 'significant items'. The cash realisation ratio was higher in the second half of the year at  $120\%$ .

Net debt at the end of the financial year was  $349.6m (FY22:$ 189.0m), and the Group has significant undrawn facilities which include $525m of new Sustainability Linked Finance facilities.

The Group's lift in earnings and strong financial position led to a  $\sim 5\%$  increase in total dividends for FY23 to 22.5 cents per share, fully franked. This represents an  $80\%$  increase in total dividends on a three-year basis as noted earlier.

# PILLAR FINANCIALS

# Food

Total Food sales (including charge-through) increased \(2.8\%\) to \(9.6bn on a normalised basis (+16.6\% 3yr normalised) despite cycling elevated sales in the second half of FY22 due to strong in-stock positions during floods and rail disruptions. Supermarkets sales increased \(2.1\%\) \((+16.1\% 3yr\) normalised) and sales in the Convenience business increased \(9.7\%\) \((+20.4\% 3yr\) normalised) driven by the addition of new customers, strong food service demand and the normalisation of customer activity post COVID restrictions.

Tobacco sales declined  $6.8\%$  reflecting the acceleration of illicit trade and continuation of the decline in smoking. On an ex-tobacco basis, total Food sales increased  $7.0\%$ $(+19.7\%$  3yr normalised) with Supermarkets wholesale sales  $+6.4\%$ $(+19.2\%$  3yr normalised) and Convenience  $+12.8\%$ $(+22.5\%$  3yr normalised).

Underpinning the strong performance is the continued successful execution of our strategic initiatives to further improve the competitiveness of the IGA network, with particular focus on prices, ranges, store quality and standards to drive value for shoppers. Sales have also been buoyed by wholesale inflation which averaged  $7.6\%$  for the year.

From early calendar 2023 we have seen a noticeable change in the behaviour of some shoppers to focus more on 'value' items. The network continued to retain the majority of shoppers gained in recent years with 'foot traffic' increasing. The impact of cost-of-living pressures and increased focus on value was seen in a flat average 'basket size'.

Retail like for like sales growth in the IGA network was  $0.9\%$  and  $+3.0\%$  ex-tobacco (3yr:  $21.4\%$ ). A record of 39 new stores were opened in the year.

Food EBIT increased  $3.8\%$  on a normalised basis to  $\$ 204.0$ m and the EBIT margin was  $2.1\%$ .

# Hardware

Hardware sales (including charge-through) increased  $10.6\%$  on a normalised basis to  $3.4\mathrm{bn}$  ( $+63.1\%$  3yr) reflecting continued growth in both IHG and Total Tools and the impact of acquisitions.

Combined sales in the IHG and Total Tools retail networks increased  $4.5\%$  to  $\$ 4.5bn (+$ 40% 3yr LfL basis).

Demand remained robust in DIY and Trade, with Trade continuing to be underpinned by a strong pipeline of construction activity and an improvement in supply availability. Inflation was again elevated in both DIY and Trade.

IHG sales (including charge-through) increased  $3.7\%$  normalised to $2.8bn (+35.0% 3yr) underpinned by solid underlying demand and inflation. Sales in the year were impacted by adverse building conditions in the second and third quarters, and by the impact in the second half of the retail network actively managing working capital in response to more challenging external conditions, particularly the decline in affordability and consumer confidence.

The IHG retail network continued to perform well with like for like retail network sales increasing  $2.7\%$ $(+34.7\%$  3yr), with Trade  $+3.8\%$ $(+25.8\%$  3yr) and DIY  $+0.6\%$ $(+53.9\%$  3yr).

Total Tools sales increased  $61.9\%$  to  $\$ 583.5$ m reflecting strong Trade activity and the impact of additional majority- owned joint venture stores. Total network sales increased  $11.6\%$  to  $\$ 1.085$ bn (FY22:  $\$ 972$ m) with like for like sales up  $4.8\%$  ( $+56.2\%$  3yr). The network continued to expand in line with its growth strategy adding a further 10 stores, bringing total network stores to 110 at year end.

Hardware EBIT increased \(16.8\%\) to \(219.2m on a normalised basis, and was up \(6.7\%\) or \(\$ 12.5m\)excluding the impact of acquisitions. IHG normalised EBIT increased \(10.3m or 8.2\%\) to \(\$ 135.7m\)and Total Tools normalised EBIT increased \(21.2m\)or \(34.0\%\) to \(\$ 83.5m\) (\(+6.9\%\) excluding acquisitions).

The Hardware EBIT margin was  $6.5\%$  (FY22:  $6.1\%$ ) which includes the positive impact of Total Tools and the retail margin from joint venture and Company-owned stores.

# Liquor

Total Liquor sales (including charge-through) increased \(8.3\%\) on a normalised basis to \(5.1bn (+37.7\% 3yr basis) with continued growth in sales to retail and on-premise customers.

The retail network again performed well with strong demand buoyed by improved competitiveness, a preference for local shopping and continuation of the at-home consumption trend. While sales increased to both the IBA network and contract customers, the rate of growth tapered in the fourth quarter reflecting the impact of higher cost of living pressures with some shoppers switching to lower-priced value choices.

Wholesale sales to the IBA banner group and contract customers increased  $5.6\%$ . Average basket size and spend were both up for the year driven by growth in the RTD and spirit categories.

Sales to on-premise customers increased a significant  $31.3\%$  reflecting expansion of the customer base through the successful execution of the on-premise growth strategy, as well as the impact of cycling COVID lockdowns in the prior financial year.

Liquor EBIT increased  $8.9\%$  to  $\$ 104.1\mathrm{m}$  on a normalised basis and the EBIT margin was  $2.1\%$ .

# PILLAR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES

We continued to see good progress and strong results with our pillar strategic initiatives. These focus on further improving the quality and value of our retailers' offer to shoppers, and in strengthening and growing our own and our network's capabilities so we can deliver value to both our retailers and suppliers.

Our key initiatives in Food focus on improving the quality of the store network through the Diamond Store Accelerator program, and ensuring the network has brand standards that deliver a consistent offer by each store format. In Hardware we are focused on growing our positions in the Trade and DIY segments, as well as expansion of both the Total Tools store network and our network of joint venture and Company-owned stores. In Liquor, we are continuing to improve value for shoppers through expansion of our owned and exclusive product range and by progressing the store upgrade program.

Further information on these initiatives can be found in the Pillar sections of the Annual Report.

# DIGITAL AND HORIZON

Our B2C digital initiatives are delivering value for shoppers and retailers at modest levels of investment, made possible through our use of partnerships. In Food, the rollout of IGA Shop Online and the IGA Rewards loyalty platforms have continued to progress well, and sales through our 'on-demand' solution, which includes partnerships with Uber Eats and DoorDash, are growing strongly. In Hardware, online sales have remained strong and we expanded the range of products to  $\sim 46,000$  in IHG and  $\sim 35,000$  in Total Tools. In Liquor, the branded online platforms for Cellarbrations, The Bottle- O and Porters are being rolled out, as are branded loyalty programs.

Take-up of our B2B eCommerce marketplaces for retailers and suppliers is continuing to grow. In Food, sales through the 'Sorted' platform broke through the one million transaction milestone in the year, and in Liquor, the new 'ALM Connect' platform has been well received since its launch late in the financial year. We are also continuing to see good growth through our leading Trade technology in Hardware, which is highly valued by IHG's Trade customers.

We have made steady progress with Project Horizon, most recently launching our new inventory forecasting and replenishment system in the Food pillar. The new system is already delivering benefits through a material lift in inventory forecasting accuracy.

We have brought the remainder of the systems build and deployment phases in-house, and extended our deployment timeline to support a phased, lower risk rollout to ensure we maximise the quality of outcomes from our investment. This action protects our own intellectual property and capability so that once we go live with the remaining systems we are positioned to better support and leverage our investment. We do not anticipate that this will increase the total capital cost of the program.

# GOING FORWARD

We are now much larger with a more diversified portfolio of businesses following the expansion of our Hardware business; we have healthy and aligned retail networks, and an experienced and passionate management team.

While we remain the largest wholesaler in our chosen sectors, our networks are well positioned in our markets as the leading supplier of hardware to small/medium size builders and the largest supplier of professional tools in Australia, the largest supplier to independent supermarkets in Australia and the second-largest player in the Australian Liquor market.

We have a strong financial position and a significant and increasing pipeline of growth opportunities to support our growth aspirations.

Despite a more challenging external environment the fundamentals of our businesses remain sound, and I am excited about how well we are positioned to address the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead of us.

# THANKS

I would like to extend my sincere thanks to our independent retailers, suppliers and the Metcash Board and management team for your encouragement and support throughout the year. I would also like to repeat my earlier thanks to all our people at Metcash who live our purpose of Championing Successful Independents every day. It has been a year of significant achievement for us, and I believe we have the right plans, support and encouragement to drive further success in FY24.

# LOCAL COMMUNITIES

# Swanbourne, Western Australia

Swanbourne IGA's mission is to support local. Since taking over the store 15 years ago, Steve and Kirsty Carre have focused on providing quality fresh produce, sourced locally from WA producers where possible, delivering exceptional customer service and giving back to the community.

Not only has the store more than doubled in size over the past decade, it has played a significant role in the community. Stock that would otherwise have gone to waste is donated to St Patrick's Catholic Church to feed the homeless, and through the Community Chest program the store provides financial support to local community and sporting groups, events, not-for-profit organisations and schools. The store also supports new and emerging businesses to commercialise their products for sale throughout the country. Steve was awarded an OAM for his service to the community in 2022.

The store won IGA's Award of Excellence in 2022, and has previously received IGA's small format innovation award in recognition of outstanding customer service, operational excellence, pride in its community and the value it places on its brands. Swanbourne is recognised as one of IGA's most awarded stores in Australia and it's a place where locals matter.

We are the largest supplier to independent supermarkets in Australia and support a network of over 1,600 stores, which include the well-known IGA and Foodland banners. We also service thousands of convenience stores, institutions, and other small businesses, through our Campbells and Convenience business.

Each store in our network strives to be the 'Best Store in their Town', from the products they sell to the charities and organisations they support, to the local people who work there. Our retailers mix local relevance, knowledge and convenience of a neighbourhood store with the quality and competitive prices of a national brand.

With a particular focus on providing value to shoppers through a broad and locally tailored range, competitive pricing, unique store experience, and exceptional customer service ... it is these attributes that create a point of difference for our retailers that local communities value.

Sales growth continued in FY23 with total Food sales up \(2.8\%\) to \(9.6bn normalised, or \(16.6\%\) on a three-year basis. Excluding tobacco sales, the increase was \(7.0\%\) and \(19.7\%\) respectively.

Underpinning the strong sales momentum has been the successful execution of initiatives to further improve the network's competitiveness. Despite shoppers facing new cost of living and interest rate challenges this year, they have continued to include our retailers in their shopping repertoire.

# With a particular focus on providing value to shoppers through a broad and locally tailored range, competitive pricing, unique store experience, and exceptional customer service ... it is these attributes that create a point of difference for our retailers that local communities value.

Our retail network is healthy and confident and there was a record number of 39 new stores opened in the year, with more stores planned for FY24.

# NETWORK OF THE FUTURE INITIATIVES

# Store upgrades

A key part of helping our stores remain competitive is improving the store experience. The network has continued to co-invest in upgrading their stores under the Diamond Store Accelerator program, with  $\sim 55\%$  of the store network now upgraded. Our target is to have  $90\%$  of the network refreshed by FY26.

# Brand standards

We have also improved the shopper experience through driving consistent IGA store standards, and now have 420 stores fully compliant and a further 555 stores nearing compliance. This phase of our Network of the Future transformation is expected to be complete by 2024.

# Range, price and private label

The IGA price gap to the major chains has narrowed to our most competitive position ever, and we are committed to helping our retailers deliver great value to local shoppers as household budgets continue to come under pressure.

Our Price Match program matches the lowest regular shelf price of essential comparable products at the chains, and was extended to all IGA stores in late 2022. Our small stores match the prices of around 200 products, our medium stores match the prices of around 600 items and our bigger stores match prices on over 1,200 items. This means shoppers will not pay more to shop at their local IGA on any item with a blue Price Match ticket. With the program now in all stores, we are able to more effectively communicate this key value program through targeted marketing campaigns.

Our Low Prices Every Day program is another way we are helping shoppers combat the recent increases in cost of living. Expanded to over 3,000 essential, competitively priced products, customers can shop at IGA with confidence, knowing that these products will be at the same low price every week.

We are also helping our retailers deliver excellent value to customers through our range of private label products under our Black & Gold and Community Co brands. We continually benchmark the quality of these products and monitor the market to ensure that the prices of these items remain competitive.

# DISTRIBUTION CAPACITY AND CAPABILITY EXPANSION

We are continuing to invest in Distribution Centres (DC) to expand our capacity and capability. We are also investing in supply chain systems to support our growth and deliver further efficiency improvements.

Despite challenges associated with supply, labour and pallet availability, we were able to maintain our customer service levels above supplier inbound service levels. This ensured our retailers were able to keep their shelves well stocked for serving their local communities.

Construction of our new DC in Truganina, Victoria started during the year and, once completed, will be the size of 16 football fields, span almost 115,000 square metres, and incorporate new automation technology and sustainability features. The new DC will house a wider range of products and deliver greater efficiencies for more than 4,000 stores and premises in Victoria. We expect the new DC to be operational in mid 2024.

We are also upgrading our DC in Western Australian and expect this to be complete in early 2024.

# ACCELERATING DIGITAL

We expanded both our IGA Shop Online and IGA Rewards loyalty programs in the year. IGA Shop Online is now live in over 330 stores, with further expansion in FY24. The IGA Rewards loyalty program is continuing to be rolled out with the program currently in \~430 stores.

On demand rapid delivery is also performing well with partnerships currently with Uber Eats and DoorDash.

We also improved the digital experience for our retailers and suppliers with R.O.S.S (Retailer One Stop Shop) now live in all States, and integrated with our new Sorted platform (online retailer/supplier marketplace). Sorted is growing rapidly, with transactions in FY23 exceeding one million.

MIGHTY HELPFUL  
MITRE 10

Our Hardware pillar comprises the Independent Hardware Group (IHG) and an  $85 \%$ stake in Total Tools Holdings. The combined IHG and Total Tools network recorded retail sales of more than $4.5bn in FY23 from over 730 stores located in metro and regional areas across the country.

The Pillar achieved strong sales growth in the year of  $10.6\%$  normalised, to  $\$ 3.4$ bn, with growth in both IHG and Total Tools. On a three- year basis, sales increased a substantial  $63.1\%$  driven by strong activity levels and the contribution from strategic acquisitions. Demand remained robust in Trade and DIY, with Trade continuing to be underpinned by a strong pipeline of construction activity and an improvement in the availability of supply.

# IHG

IHG is Australia's largest home improvement wholesaler and the second-largest player in the Australian Hardware market. It is home to the well-known Mitre 10 and Home Hardware brands and supplies more than 1,500 hardware stores nationwide.

The network caters to Trade and DIY customers serviced from a broad range of store formats, including large warehouses to convenience operations and trade centres, as well as frame and truss sites.

The culture of IHG is built on being a low cost and transparent business partner to our retailer members, with an unwavering commitment to protect and grow a sustainable independent hardware sector for the long term.

The business continued to make good progress with its strategic initiatives, focused on expanding its store network and growing sales in both the Trade and DIY segments.

# Store network

There were 10 new sites completed during the year. Three new stores were opened by independents, and there were seven acquisitions (including two frame and truss sites), reflecting further consolidation of the fragmented Trade market and our focus on securing independent businesses.

There are now five co-located Mitre 10 and Total Tools sites, with two in New South Wales, two in Victoria and one in South Australia. More co-located stores are expected to open in FY24.

# Build Trade

Key to increasing our share of the supply component of a house build is the successful execution of our 'Whole of House' strategy. With CRM insights now across 500 builders, we can identify opportunities by build stage. We also now have six Design 10 showrooms open which offer a differentiated experience for builders and consumers.

Our network of Sapphire standard stand-alone Trade Centres has grown to 42, and we are well on track to reach our target of 50 Trade Centre stores by 2024. We also now have 20 frame and truss facilities within the network.

# Grow DIY

Our DIY customer base continued to grow, with sales in this segment representing  $37 \%$ of total Pillar sales in FY23. A key driver of growth in DIY is our highly effective Sapphire store upgrade strategy which continued to attract more DIY shoppers to IHG. It has also delivered great results for our retailers, with average sales growth of  $\sim 28 \%$ for the period following completion of the Sapphire upgrade.

The Sapphire strategy aims to ensure stores across the IHG network are leading edge and tailored to each store's unique location in the community it serves. This includes having the right DIY product categories and service offer to engage and support local shoppers. We have continued to make good progress against our target of 300 upgraded stores by 2025, with 190 stores now through the program.

Total Tools provides significant growth opportunities for the Hardware pillar. In addition to strong demand for professional tools, the Pillar continues to grow through expansion of its store footprint, and through the acquisition of retail stores.

Another way we are attracting DIY shoppers to our stores is by strengthening our Mitre 10 and Home Hardware brands. We have moved to a 'two-brand' strategy with Mitre 10 being IHG's primary brand, and Home Hardware positioned as a strong local brand, ensuring that each market has the most relevant and appropriate brand and format.

There were 364 Mitre 10 and 150 Home Hardware stores at the end of FY23. A further 30 Thrifty Link and True Value stores were converted to Home Hardware stores in the year. Our aim is to build a network of ~400 Mitre 10 and ~200 Home Hardware Stores, with smaller brands encouraged to move to these stronger brands.

# TOTAL TOOLS HOLDINGS

Total Tools Holdings is the franchisor to the largest professional tools network in Australia. It is a complementary business to IHG, targeting tradespeople that use professional tools for a living with an unrivalled range of the best professional brands in the world, together with professional service solutions and advice.

Total Tools provides significant growth opportunities for the Hardware pillar. In addition to strong demand for professional tools, the Pillar continues to grow through expansion of its store footprint, and through the acquisition of retail stores, usually via a joint venture with the existing independent owner.

# Network expansion

A further 10 stores were added to the network in the year, increasing its size to 110 stores at the end of FY23. We are on track to build a network of  $\sim 140$  stores by 2026, with significant opportunities in New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia and Victoria. We also continued to upgrade stores and now have the majority of the network (98 stores) refreshed under the Sapphire store upgrade program.

# Joint venture/Company-owned stores

Our strategy of having a mix of independents and Metcash majority-owned joint venture (JV) stores has continued to prove successful. A further eight JV stores were acquired and three new JV stores were opened during the year to bring the total number of majority-owned JV and Company-owned stores to 46. Our target is to have  $\sim 50\%$  of the store network as joint venture/Company-owned stores.

# DIGITAL

We continue to invest in accelerating our digital solutions, offering a strong omni-channel shopping experience for consumers in-store, online and via app. Online sales represent  $6 \%$ of Hardware pillar sales in FY23, and the digital offer now includes over 80,000 SKUs.

We also saw continued growth in loyalty members, with 1.4m customers now part of the Mitre 10 and Home Hardware loyalty programs. Total Tools also has a very loyal customer base with its market-leading Insider Loyalty program having over 1.8 members, representing  $90\%$  of its sales base (excluding commercial).

In Trade, we saw growth in the uptake of our Trade technology suite amongst the network and builders. The use of Tradetechnology allows IHG to focus on providing the builder with the tools they need to get in, get out and get on with the job at hand, reducing costs for the builder and driving loyalty.

Our Liquor pillar supplies  $\sim 90\%$  of independent liquor stores in Australia, making us the second-largest player in the Australian liquor market. We are also home to nationally recognised liquor store brands such as Cellarbrations, The Bottle-O, Porters and IGA Liquor.

The Liquor pillar has a balanced mix of retail, on-premise and contract customers that stands us in good stead when it comes to dealing with external challenges.

Our independent retail network includes great retail stores that are conveniently located where customers want to shop with product ranges tailored for each store's local community. We also have an evolving digital business and a growing owned and exclusive range of products.

The Liquor pillar continued to outperform in FY23, with total sales (including charge-through) up \(8.3\%\) on a normalised basis, to \(\$ 5.1bn. There was continued growth in sales to retail and on-premise customers, with on-premise sales particularly strong driven by the addition of new customers and a return to out-of-home consumption post COVID-related restrictions. The Pillar has delivered substantial sales growth over the past three years of \(37.7\%\).

# AUSTRALIAN LIQUOR MARKETERS (ALM)

Our ALM division is the centre of the liquor pillar's flywheel. We have a network of 14 DCs located across Australia and New Zealand, with five of these being 'mega' DCs which are shared with the Food pillar, delivering efficiencies and scale advantages that help support the competitiveness of our customers.

We supply over 14,000 licensed venues in Australia, servicing IBA (Independent Brands Australia) retail banner stores, large and small contract banner groups, unbannered liquor stores as well as licensed premises and eCommerce retailers.

# DRIVING GREATER EFFICIENCIES

The year included launching ALM Connect, a new charge-through service endorsed by both retailers and suppliers which helps drive greater sales and efficiencies. ALM Connect includes an 'extended aisle' that grants access to an expanding range of non-warehouse products, all through the one ALM ordering portal. This provides greater choice to retailers and more sales opportunities for suppliers. It also streamlines the charge-through sales process through automation.

Scheduled for launch in FY24 is ALM's Retailer One Stop Shop (R.O.S.S) platform. The new platform provides one location from which all ALM customers can access end-to-end information, online ordering and all their wholesale needs.

As an additional service to customers, we are rolling out our new Truck Tracker technology in all States of Australia. The technology enables delivery notifications to be provided to customers to help them keep track of their orders through our multiple delivery partners.

# IBA STORE NETWORK

Our IBA network consists of over 3,000 stores across Australia and includes the well-known brands of Cellarbrations, The Bottle-O, IGA Liquor and Porters Liquor. State-based brands in our portfolio include Thirsty Camel Bottleshop and Duncans along with un-bannered Liquor@ stores. We also support an additional ~370 stores in New Zealand under The Bottle-O and Liquor Centre brands.

The network includes \~1,430 tier one retailers that are supported through a full array of retail services including receiving benefits from our national buying capacity, marketing support, promotional programs, network investment and through access to our growing portfolio of owned and exclusive brands.

The retail network again performed well during the year with strong demand buoyed by the success of our initiatives to improve the competitiveness of the network, a preference for local shopping and continuation of the at-home consumption trend.

# The Liquor pillar has continued to outperform with substantial sales growth of  $\sim 38\%$  over the past three years.

In addition to our continued focus on product range, competitive prices and service, customers include the quality of stores in their assessment of value. The network continues to invest in improving the store experience for shoppers with a further  $90+$  stores and 70 cool rooms refreshed in the year.

# OWNED AND EXCLUSIVE BRANDS

Sales of our owned and exclusive products continued to grow in FY23. Our investment to expand this range not only benefits Metcash, but also improves margins for our retailers while delivering excellent value to our shoppers.

Value is becoming increasingly important for some shoppers due to cost of living pressures and we are confident we have a wide range of brands and products that cater for all shoppers, whether they are looking for value or higher quality.

POETS beer was introduced in the year and gained significant support across the IBA network, as did the Cougar brand of bourbon which is exclusive to IBA and was relaunched during the year.

# BUILDING BRANDS THROUGH VALUE AND LOYALTY

The year included the roll out of successful brand campaigns for Cellarbrations, The Bottle-O, IGA Liquor and Porters Liquor. Our focus is on further building brand awareness and appeal, which is being used as a platform for expanding the customer base for our retailers. We are also gaining new shoppers to the network through our loyalty program and value product offer.

Both the Cellarbrations Top Drop Rewards and The Bottle-O Rewards loyalty programs were launched in the year following the success of earlier pilot programs. These programs are designed to drive foot traffic, increase the retention of retailers, derive consumer insights and data and deliver a personalised offer for the shopper. Loyalty members receive access to exclusive member pricing and promotions based on their drinking preferences and behaviours.

# LOCAL STORY

# SUPPORTING LOCAL ECONOMIES

# Blue Mountains, New South Wales

Murray Croft and Charlotte Burns own three Porters Liquor stores in the Blue Mountains, New South Wales at Glenbrook, Blaxland East and Warrimoo. Their entry, and then rapid expansion, in the region has made a positive impact on the local economy, as an employer and distributor for local suppliers, as well as the ripple effect on surrounding stores who have benefitted from the increase in foot traffic.

Murray's stores specialise in craft beer, including local brewer Mountain Culture, voted Best Beer in Australia in the 2022 GABS (Great Australasian Beer SpecTAPular) Hottest 100, premium spirits and boutique wines. Porters Glenbrook won the NSW Porters Liquor Store of the Year award in 2021.

Sustainability continued

This year's highlights showcase our significant progress and ongoing commitment to environmental stewardship, social responsibility and governance.

FY23 marks a very important milestone for Metcash from a reporting perspective. The full Sustainability Report has been prepared for the first time with reference to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), and our climate-related disclosures are aligned to the Taskforce for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). This ensures we are well positioned to adopt the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) reporting framework when it becomes applicable for Metcash in FY25.

A significant highlight this year was acknowledgement by Dow Jones of the substantial improvements made in our ESG credentials, positioning us in the 87th percentile of their Sustainability Index, up from the 69th percentile in FY22, reflecting our ongoing efforts to enhance sustainability practices across our operations.

We also received a 'B' assessment from the Carbon Disclosure Project, affirming our transparency and accountability in managing and reporting climate risks, as well as recognising the progress made to further improve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The year also included establishing a sustainability-linked finance facility of \(525m which creates a strong link between the cost of doing business and our sustainability credentials. We have performance requirements linked to the facility that include achieving our emissions and renewables targets, reducing waste to landfill and measures related to improving the wellbeing of our people.

We believe our achievements help reinforce our dedication to sustainability and progress towards creating a more sustainable future, which is a key component of our corporate vision.

Battery recycling is now available in over 450 hardware stores

# OUR PLANET

We made good progress towards achieving our stated long-term sustainability goals and targets, including our commitment to the 1.5-degree 2030 Science Based Target (aligned to the Paris Agreement). Achievement of this target is equal to a  $42\%$  reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our 2020 baseline, and from here we are targeting to reach Net Zero by 2040 for Scope 1 and 2. This year our emissions reduced a further  $5.2\%$  to  $\sim 74k$  tonnes, in line with the trend required to reach the 2030 and 2040 targets.

Our estimate of Scope 3 emissions was reassessed in FY23 to be 1.158m tonnes, up from our estimate of  $\sim 860\mathrm{k}$  tonnes during our baseline year of FY20. This means that  $\sim 94\%$  of Metcash's total carbon footprint is derived from upstream and downstream activity. We are currently assessing opportunities to help reduce Scope 3 emissions.

Our plans to minimise our environmental impact and foster a circular economy include the development and implementation of innovative waste management practices and increased recycling efforts. Reflecting our aim is the establishment this year of a new waste target of diverting  $80 \%$ of waste to landfill by 2028, which encompasses all controlled sites across the Metcash organisation.

From a product perspective, we continue to ensure our private label brand standards are met. This includes our private label fresh pork, chicken, beef, lamb, milk and eggs all being  $100\%$  Australian raised or grown. We also ensure that we source  $100\%$  RSPO certified sustainable palm oil and continue to work towards our 2025 goals of sustainably sourced tea, coffee, cocoa, paper-based products and seafood.

# OUR PEOPLE

We are committed to creating an inclusive and equitable workplace that harnesses the diverse talents of our employees. We have achieved our 40/40/20 gender diversity target for the Board and Group Leadership, with  $50\%$  representation of women on the Metcash Board and  $44\%$  at Group Leadership level. This year we were again listed as an Employer of Choice by the Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA), the fifth consecutive year, reflecting our commitment and progress in this area.

Employee satisfaction, commitment to our organisation and alignment with our purpose of Championing Successful Independents is key to our success. Our continued focus on making Metcash 'a favourite place to work' led to our employee engagement results placing us at the 71st percentile of internationally benchmarked companies for salaried (TEC) employees.

Ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our employees is our highest priority. This year we revised our Safety, Health and Environment (SHE) Strategy and established both short- and long-term initiatives aimed at preventing work-related injuries and illnesses to team members, contractors and visitors at our sites, as well as in our supply chain. Pleasingly, there was a reduction in recordable injuries in the year of over  $34\%$ , compared to the prior year. Our focus is broad and includes supporting our independent retailers to also improve their safety.

# OUR COMMUNITY AND CUSTOMERS

We believe in supporting and giving back to the communities in which we operate. Through our IGA Community Chest program we donated \(3.1 m to community groups in the year, an increase of 30% on last year. We also donated over 606,000 meals and 22 tonnes of essential grocery items via Foodbank and other charities.

We continued to make progress in protecting the rights of people in our supply chain. This included tailoring and updating our modern slavery awareness training for procurement teams, closing-out findings from SEDEX (Supplier Ethical Data Exchange) social audits, and further expanding the use of supplier surveys to help identify areas of concern. We are also in the process of rolling out a pilot program that provides a worker voice platform to improve our ability to hear directly from potentially vulnerable workers in our supply chain.

We have commenced implementing the Health Star Rating (HSR) on all eligible private label products, with completion expected by the end of FY25. We are also active participants in the Australian Government's Healthy Food Partnership, with reformulation targets set for reducing the use of salt, sugar and saturated fat.

For further detail, please refer to the full Sustainability Report published on our website: www.metcash.com/sustainability in August 2023.

# DIRECTORS' REPORT

Your Directors submit their report of Metcash Limited (the 'Company') and its controlled entities (together the 'Group' or 'Metcash') for the financial year ended 30 April 2023 ('FY23').

# OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW

# 1. METCASH'S BUSINESS MODEL

Metcash is Australia's leading wholesaler and distributor, supplying and supporting an extensive network of independent retailers which form part of our banned network and several other unbannered businesses across the Food, Hardware and Liquor pillars. Metcash's retail customers operate some of Australia's leading independent brands including: IGA, Foodland, Mitre 10, Home Hardware, Total Tools, Cellarbrations, IGA Liquor and the Bottle-O. We help them to be the 'Best Store in their Town' by providing merchandising, operational and marketing support.

Metcash operates a low-cost distribution model that enables independent retailers to compete against the vertically integrated retail chains and other competitors. The Group's core competencies include: procurement, logistics, marketing, retail development and retail operational support. Metcash operates major distribution centres in all the mainland states of Australia which are complemented by a number of smaller warehouses and a portfolio of corporate and joint venture stores.

The Group employs over 8,000 people and indirectly supports employment in the independent retail network.

# 2. STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES

Metcash's purpose is 'Championing successful independents'. Metcash's vision includes:

supporting independent retailers to be the best store in their town;  
- being passionate about independents;  
- being a favourite place to work;  
- being a business partner of choice for suppliers and independents;  
supporting thriving communities; and  
- creating a sustainable future.

The strategic vision is underpinned by a number of programs and initiatives across the three pillars (Food, Hardware and Liquor) aimed at supporting our independent retailers. These include store upgrade programs, new store formats and brand clarity, expanding private label brands, core ranging and pricing, marketing support, accelerating eCommerce and system enhancements as well as training and development programs for independent retailers.

The Group commenced the MFuture program at the beginning of FY20. This five-year program spans all pillars and support functions and adopts a balanced approach to revenue growth and cost savings. The program has a strong focus on accelerating successful current initiatives, following the shopper into new growth areas, improving the Group's infrastructure to enable simpler and cheaper processes and ensuring a sustainable cost base into the future. The program aims to deliver competitive and successful independent retail networks across all pillars and match store formats to customers shopping missions.

# 3. KEY DEVELOPMENTS

# Acquisition of Total Tools independent retail stores ('JV Stores')

The Total Tools acquisition has been very successful, with the business continuing to grow strongly since the acquisition of our  $70 \%$ majority stake in FY21 and a further  $15 \%$ ownership interest in FY22. Put and call option arrangements exist which enable Metcash to acquire the remaining  $15 \%$ ownership interest in the franchisor, exercisable between 1 November 2023 and 31 January 2024. It is a complementary business to our Hardware pillar, targeting tradespeople that use professional tools for a living with an unrivalled range of the best professional brands in the world, together with professional service solutions and advice. During the year, the Total Tools store footprint has continued to expand with the further acquisition of ownership interests of between  $51 \%$ and  $60 \%$ in eight Total Tools independent retail stores for $31.7 million, together with the establishment of three greenfield JV stores. Put and call option arrangements exist which enable Metcash to acquire  $100 \%$ of all 38 Total Tools JV Stores across FY25, FY26, FY27 and FY31. Further details are set out in notes 5.3 and 6.1 of the financial report.

# Project Horizon implementation costs

Project Horizon is a critical group technical infrastructure consolidation and replacement program aimed at repositioning Metcash to be a modern, technology-led wholesaler. The program provides the platform to drive simplification and efficiency across the business, as well as making it easier for customers and suppliers to do business with Metcash. The first deployments have been the finance and inventory forecasting and replenishment components, with the inventory forecasting and replenishment system delivering early benefits and significantly improving forecasting accuracy. The remaining components of the first stage are focused on accessing benefits within the Food and Liquor pillars.

The program is subject to continual assessment in relation to program governance, independent assurance, Board oversight and program risks. To further minimise risks to our customers and business and help ensure project outcomes are maximised, the expected completion date for stage 1 has been extended from the end of 2023 to the end of FY2025. The change in timeline has been supported by Metcash's ability to maintain its current systems longer than anticipated and does not result in a change to the expected capital expenditure of the project and a limited increase in operating project office expenses for the longer time frame.

In FY23, the Group incurred  $62.8 million (FY22:$ 46.9 million) of capital expenditure which comprised $60.2 million in relation to software assets and $2.6 million in relation to prepaid assets and $34.6 million (FY22: $31.4 million) of expenses on the project. The project expenses included resource costs, accelerated amortisation of legacy software assets and incremental software licence and maintenance costs. These costs are separately disclosed within significant items in the Statement of Comprehensive Income to enable a better understanding of the Group's results.

# Changes in key management personnel (KMP)

Peter Birtles was appointed as Chair of the Board effective 1 August 2022.

Mark Johnson joined the Metcash Board as an Independent Non-executive Director on 1 August 2022.

Robert Murray retired from the Board on 31 August 2022.

Details of Directors' experience and qualifications are included within this report.

# Dividend declaration

The Board has determined to pay a fully franked final FY23 dividend of 11.0 cents per share, which brings total dividends for the year to 22.5 cents per share fully franked, which represents a dividend payout ratio of  $70.6\%$  of underlying profit after tax.

# 4. KEY FINANCIAL MEASURES

# Warehouse earnings

Metcash's operations are designed to allow significant volumes to be distributed through its warehouse infrastructure at a relatively fixed cost base. The ability to leverage volumes through the warehouse is a key driver of profitability for both Metcash and the independent retail network.

In addition to warehouse revenue, earnings are impacted by product category mix and the proportion of the Group's products bought by the network. Warehouse revenue and related margins are driven by competitive pricing, promotional activities and the level of supplier support through volumetric and other rebates.

Metcash also operates a portfolio of corporate and joint venture retail stores, predominantly in the Hardware pillar.

Metcash has a number of key programs in place to drive sales and margins, including through pricing and promotion, product range, retail operational standards and consumer alignment.

# Cost of doing business

The Group's profitability depends on the efficiency and effectiveness of its operating model. This is achieved by optimising the Group's cost of doing business ('CODB') which comprises the various costs of operating the distribution centres, retail stores and the administrative support functions. During FY23, the efficiency of the supply chain was impacted by the continuation of global supply chain challenges.

The MFuture program includes initiatives aimed at both revenue growth and ensuring the Group has a sustainable cost base.

# Funds employed and return on capital

The Group's funds employed is primarily influenced by the seasonal working capital cycle. The Group has longer term capital investments predominantly in relation to its supply chain capabilities, including warehouse automation technologies and software development. In Hardware, the Group has acquired a network of corporate and JV retail stores. The Group also invests alongside the independent retail network, mainly in the form of equity participation or short-term loans.

The Board's intention is to continue to invest in the business for future growth while maintaining a strong financial position and otherwise to assess returning surplus capital to shareholders.

# Impact of the 53rd trading week in FY22

The current financial year represents a 52-week trading period (from 2 May 2022 to 30 April 2023) as compared to a 53-week trading period in the previous financial year (from 26 April 2021 to 1 May 2022). Section 5 of this report provides an overview of the Group's financial performance.

# DIRECTORS' REPORT CONTINUED

# Climate change and sustainability disclosure

Metcash aligns with the Task Force for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures and full information on our climate response can be obtained in the Our Planet section of Metcash's Sustainability Report. The management of climate-related risks and opportunities at Metcash is overseen by its ESG Council through the Climate Change Risk Register. These various risks are combined and represented in an overall Climate Risk category in the Group Risk Profile. At the time of writing, the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) latest Exposure Draft is undergoing industry consultation, and is therefore yet to be finalised. However, Metcash already discloses information related to greenhouse gas emissions and targets, transition risks, physical risks, climate-related opportunities and climate metrics tied to management performance and remuneration.

# Non-IFRS Information

(b) Underlying earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing UPAT by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.

The FY22 results included a  $53^{\text{rd}}$  trading week. Comparisons with FY22 within this section are based on a 52-week basis (using 52/53 calculation method i.e. normalised basis).

Group reported revenue, which excludes charge-through sales<sup>1</sup>, increased 6.2% to  $15.8 billion (FY22:$ 14.9 billion). Including charge-through sales<sup>1</sup>, Group revenue increased 5.7% to $18.1 billion (FY22: $17.1 billion), with growth in each pillar building on the strong sales performance over the prior two years.

Group underlying EBIT increased  $8.1\%$  to a record $500.8 million, with earnings growth in all pillars reflecting continued strong demand, good operating discipline and the success of strategic acquisitions and initiatives. On a three-year basis, Group underlying EBIT increased  $49.5\%$ .

The Food pillar continued to perform well delivering EBIT growth of  $3.8\%$  (3-year:  $+11.7\%$ ) reflecting the strong trading performance and improved leverage, supported by an improved retail network that is more relevant and competitive than ever before.

Hardware continued to build on the exceptional earnings growth over the past two years, delivering a further  $16.8\%$  increase in EBIT (3-year:  $+160.3\%$ ). The strong growth reflects robust underlying demand and the increased contribution from majority-owned company and joint venture stores in IHG and Total Tools. This strategy of investing in our own stores, often with independent partners, has proved to be a very effective growth driver.

The Liquor pillar continued to outperform, delivering a further  $8.9\%$  increase in EBIT (3-year:  $+43.0\%$ ) buoyed by ongoing strong sales to retail customers and continuation of the recovery in on-premise sales which were cycling the adverse impact of COVID-related trading restrictions.

Group underlying profit after tax $^2$  increased  $4.6\%$  to  $307.5$  million, and statutory profit after tax increased  $7.6\%$  to  $\$259.0$  million. Underlying earnings per share increased  $6.4\%$  to 31.8 cents reflecting the increase in profit after tax.

The FY22 results included a  $53^{\mathrm{rd}}$  trading week. Comparisons with FY22 within this section are based on a 52-week basis (using 52/53 calculation method i.e. normalised basis).

# Food

Total Food sales (including charge-through<sup>1</sup>) increased 2.8% to $9.6 billion on a normalised basis (+16.6% 3-year normalised<sup>3</sup>) despite cycling elevated sales in the second half of FY22 due to strong in-stock positions during floods and rail disruptions. Supermarkets sales increased 2.1% (+16.1% 3-year normalised<sup>3</sup>) and Convenience increased 9.7% (+20.4% 3-year normalised<sup>3</sup>) driven by the addition of new customers, strong food service demand and the normalisation of customer activity post COVID restrictions.

Tobacco sales declined  $6.8\%$  reflecting the acceleration of illicit trade and continuation of the decline in smoking. On an ex-tobacco basis, total Food sales increased  $7.0\%$ $(+19.7\%)$  3-year normalised<sup>3)</sup> with Supermarkets wholesale sales  $+6.4\%$ $(+19.2\%)$  3-year normalised<sup>3)</sup> and Convenience  $+12.8\%$ $(+22.5\%)$  3-year normalised<sup>3)</sup>.

Underpinning the strong performance is the continued successful execution of our strategic initiatives to further improve the competitiveness of the IGA network, with particular focus on prices, ranges, store quality and standards to drive value for shoppers. Sales have also been buoyed by wholesale inflation which averaged  $7.6\%$  for the year, and reached a peak of  $9.1\%$  in the third quarter.

There has been a noticeable change in some shoppers behaviour from early calendar 2023, to focus more on 'value' items. The network continued to retain the majority of shoppers gained in recent years with 'foot traffic' increasing. The impact of cost of living pressures and increased focus on value was seen in a flat average 'basket size'.

Retail like for like⁴ sales growth in the IGA network was 0.9% and +3.0% ex-tobacco (3-year: 21.4%). The network remains healthy, confident and continues to reinvest. A record number of 39 new stores were opened in the year.

Food EBIT increased  $3.8\%$  on a normalised basis to  $\$204.0$  million reflecting the strong trading performance, which more than offset the impact of additional costs, particularly labour and freight.

The Food EBIT margin<sup>5</sup> was maintained at  $2.1\%$  despite these additional costs.

# Hardware

Hardware sales (including charge-through) increased \(10.6\%\) on a normalised basis to \\(3.4 billion (+63.1% 3-year) reflecting continued growth in both IHG and Total Tools and the impact of acquisitions (\)173.2 million). Combined sales in the IHG and Total Tools retail networks increased \(4.5\%\) to \(\sim\) \\)4.5 billion (+~40% 3-year LfL basis).

Demand remained robust in DIY and Trade, with Trade continuing to be underpinned by a strong pipeline of construction activity and an improvement in supply availability. Inflation continued to be elevated in both DIY and Trade.

IHG sales (including charge-through<sup>1</sup>) increased  $3.7\%$  normalised to $2.8 billion (+35.0% 3-year) underpinned by solid underlying demand and inflation. Sales in the year were impacted by adverse building conditions in the second and third quarters, and from the impact in the second half of the retail network actively managing working capital in response to more challenging external conditions, particularly the decline in affordability and consumer confidence.

The IHG retail network continued to perform well with like for like retail network sales increasing  $2.7\%^6$  ( $+34.7\%$  3-year), with Trade  $+3.8\%$  ( $+25.8\%$  3-year) and DIY  $+0.6\%$  ( $+53.9\%$  3-year).

Total Tools sales  $^7$ increased  $61.9 \%$ to  $5 8 3 . 5$ million reflecting strong Trade activity and the impact of additional majority- owned joint venture stores. Total network sales increased  $11.6 \%$ to  $\$ 1.085$ billion (FY22:  $\$ 972$  million) with like for like sales up  $4.8 \% ^ {8}$  ( $+56.2 \%$ 3- year). The network continued to expand in line with its growth strategy adding a further 10 stores, bringing total network stores to 110 at year end.

Hardware online sales increased by  $0.6\%$  to represent  $\sim 6\%$  of total Hardware sales.

# DIRECTORS' REPORT CONTINUED

Hardware EBIT increased  $16.8\%$  to  $219.2$  million on a normalised basis reflecting strong trading, particularly in retail and the impact of acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, the increase was  $\$ 12.5$  million or  $6.7\%$  on a normalised basis. IHG normalised EBIT increased  $\$ 10.3$  million or  $8.2\%$  to  $\$ 135.7$  million reflecting the strong sales performance and the contribution from acquisitions, which was partly offset by additional fuel, freight and labour costs. The IHG wholesale margin was  $2.9\%$ . Total Tools normalised EBIT increased  $\$ 21.2$  million or  $34.0\%$  to  $\$ 83.5$  million reflecting the strong sales performance and the impact of majority-owned joint venture stores acquired during the current and prior years. Excluding acquisitions the increase was  $6.9\%$ .

The Hardware EBIT margin was  $6.5\%$  (FY22: 6.1%) which includes the positive impact of Total Tools and the retail margin from joint venture and company-owned stores.

# Liquor

Total Liquor sales (including charge-through) increased  $8.3\%$  on a normalised basis to  $\$ 5.1$  billion (+37.7% 3- year basis) with continued growth in sales to retail and on- premise customers.

The retail network again performed well with strong demand buoyed by improved competitiveness, a preference for local shopping and continuation of the at-home consumption trend. While sales increased to both the IBA network and contract customers, the rate of growth tapered in the fourth quarter reflecting the impact of higher cost of living pressures with some switching to lower priced value choices. Sales of Owned and Exclusive brands increased  $17\%$  in the year.

Wholesale sales to the IBA banner group and contract customers increased  $5.6\%$ . Average basket size and spend were both up for the year driven by growth in the RTD and spirit categories.

Sales to on-premise customers increased a significant  $31.3\%$  reflecting expansion of the customer base through the successful execution of the on-premise growth strategy, as well as the impact of cycling COVID lockdowns in the prior financial year.

Liquor EBIT increased \(8.9\%\) to \\(104.1 million on a normalised basis reflecting the contribution from the strong trading performance, partly offset by additional fuel, freight and labour costs. The EBIT margin for Liquor increased to \(2.1\%\) (FY22: \(2.0\%\)).

# Finance costs and tax

Net finance costs increased during the year driven by higher interest rates and higher debt. Tax expense of $127.3 million on underlying profit represents an effective tax rate of 29.2% (FY22: 28.9%).

# Significant items

Significant items categories were consistent with the half-year and included Project Horizon implementation costs of  $34.6 million (FY22:$ 31.4 million), put option valuation and business acquisition costs of  $30.0 million (FY22:$ 27.6 million), Mega Distribution Centre transition costs of $4.3 million (FY22: $3.6 million) and impairment reversals of $9.3 million (net benefit) (FY22: impairment expense of $3.0 million).

Group operating cash flows were  $372.7 million (FY22:$ 432.3 million), reflecting a strong cash realisation ratio of 77% (FY22: 91%), which was achieved notwithstanding the increase in working capital, spend associated with significant items such as Project Horizon and additional tax payments.

The Group had net investing outflows of  $199.6 million, including capital expenditure of$ 152.1 million (including $60.2 million on Project Horizon), acquisitions of businesses of  $55.9 million and acquisition of additional interest in associate of$ 4.5 million. The acquisitions of businesses were predominantly in the Hardware pillar and included an investment in eight Total Tools 'JV Stores'. The Group also increased its ownership interests in two Total Tools JV stores and one Hardware retail store by acquisition of non-controlling interests of $12.8 million (FY22: $59.4 million for 15% step up acquisition of Total Tools Holdings).

The Group paid $217.2 million (FY22: $198.5 million) in dividends during the current financial year. Total dividends paid in FY23 was 22.5 cents per share (FY22: 20.0 cents per share).

Net working capital increased by  $79.8 million to$ 488.0 million reflecting the higher level of Group sales including inflation; the increased weighting of Hardware in the Group sales portfolio which has higher outstanding days and inventory in stores; and growth from the acquisition of businesses.

Put option liabilities of $282.2 million, predominantly relate to the Total Tools Group (refer note 5.3 of the financial report).

The Group was in a net debt position as at 30 April 2023 of \(349.6 million (FY22: \)189.0 million) of which \)150.0 million was hedged via interest rate swaps, with a weighted average hedge maturity of 1.2 years and a weighted average interest rate of \(3.7\%\). The increase in the Group's net debt position reflects our continued investment in capital expenditure to drive growth and the maintenance of our \(\sim 70\%\) dividend payout ratio. Metcash had $653.7 million in unused debt facilities and $89.5 million of cash and cash equivalents available at the reporting date for immediate use.

# Commitments, contingencies and other financial exposures

Put options, including in relation to Ritchies Stores Pty Ltd, are detailed along with other contingent liabilities in note 5.3 and note 7.3 of the financial statements.

Metcash has a modest exposure to interest rate risk and minimal foreign exchange exposures. Further details are set out in note 5.6 of the financial statements.

# 6. OUTLOOK

Solid sales growth has continued in the first seven weeks of FY24 with all pillars continuing to perform well. Group sales increased  $2.3\%$ , with the rate of growth in Food similar, and Hardware up, compared to 2H23.

While demand continues to be solid in all pillars, the impact of higher interest rates and cost of living has started to impact consumer confidence and the behaviour of some customers and shoppers in our retail networks.

The business is actively managing increased cost pressures, particularly labour, as well as an increased tax burden in Victoria due to recently announced changes in workers compensation, payroll and land tax. The estimated increase in Victorian tax is  $\sim$ 10.0 million in FY24.

We are well positioned to continue delivering growth and superior returns for shareholders through the cycle. The fundamentals for our businesses remain sound, supported by high employment, increasing population and immigration and continued government investment in infrastructure and housing.

Our Group is much larger, more diversified and stronger than it was three years ago, and our management team and retail networks are experienced at managing well through challenges, including changes in the external environment.

Importantly, we have healthy and supportive retail networks and an increasing pipeline of growth opportunities. Our financial position is strong and we have an experienced management team to continue progressing our growth plans.

# DIRECTORS' REPORT CONTINUED

# 7. MATERIAL BUSINESS RISKS

The following section outlines the material business risks that may impact on the Group achieving its strategic objectives and business operations, including the mitigating factors put in place to address those risks. The material risks are not set out in any particular order and exclude many general risks that could have a material effect on most businesses in Australia under normal operating conditions.

# Strategy and disruption risks

Consumer behaviour and preferences continue to change and are influenced by factors such as economic conditions, digital and technological development and disruption, healthy living trends, sustainability preferences and increasing choices in both online and in-store retail options. These changes may impact Metcash's sales mix and earnings. Metcash's strategy puts customers and consumers first, with ongoing focus on our shopper-led range, e-commerce and loyalty, store quality and overall perception of value at checkout.

Metcash is accelerating its investment in digital, expanding our capability and improving our delivery of digital solutions to our retailers and shoppers. This is being achieved through investment in our online stores, such as the upgraded IGA Online Shop, new and enhanced IBA banned online stores, and the continued success of the Mitre 10 and Total Tools online platforms.

In executing its strategy, there is a risk that Metcash may experience project execution issues or may not realise the full benefits of projects that underpin its strategic plan. There is also a risk that projects may experience scope, time or cost variability or overruns. We seek to manage this risk through our Program Management Office and approach to project governance, including oversight by the Group Leadership Team and the Board.

Metcash's business operations and strategic priorities are subject to ongoing review and development. Management regularly reviews plans against market changes and, where necessary, modifies its approach.

# COVID-19 and pandemic risks

The World Health Organisation has declared an end to the COVID-19 public health emergency of international concern. Throughout FY23, Metcash continued to experience some challenges influenced by COVID-19, including absenteeism, low to moderate levels of supply chain disruption, and workforce labour shortages. Whilst there were some challenges, we continued to serve our independent retailers across all of our Pillars, and importantly ensured continuity of supply of critical food and grocery products to our retailers, supporting local communities across Australia.

Whilst the pandemic has ended, the Group's operations and those of our customers and suppliers could be impacted by COVID-19 through any continuation of restrictions such as social distancing, quarantines, travel or migration restrictions, work stoppages, health authority actions, lockdowns or other related measures. Any of these factors may impact our operational and financial performance.

# Competition risks

Any increase in competitive activity from new or existing competitors (including in the form of acquisitions by competitors of independent stores in our network, a new market entrant with a wholesale or other disruptive business model, where suppliers sell directly to the Group's customers, where customers form their own buying groups to collectively negotiate and purchase directly from suppliers or where indirect competitors change their business models to compete directly with the Group) may have a detrimental effect on the Group's operations, particularly if Metcash fails to respond effectively to that competitive activity or its response is delayed (for example, as a result of the time required to engage with the Group's independent retail network in order to implement an initiative). Increased competition may also adversely impact Metcash's long-term performance and profitability. We seek to manage this risk through the delivery of our strategic plan and execution of initiatives.

# Key brands risk

Metcash's success in generating profits and increasing its market share is based on the success of the key brands it owns or licences. Reliance on key brands makes Metcash vulnerable to brand damage from negative publicity, product tampering or recalls, unauthorised use of its brands or ineffective brand management by Metcash or its licensees, increasing the risk of asset write downs. We seek to manage this risk through contractual arrangements with licensees, trademark monitoring, and implementation of controls to manage private label product quality and safety.

# Macroeconomic and geopolitical risk

General macroeconomic conditions and factors including inflation, low levels of unemployment, monetary policy and variability in interest rates, changes in governments and their approach to fiscal policy, variability in energy and input costs, cyclicality in building and construction markets, and changes in consumer purchasing behaviour may adversely impact our customers as well as Metcash's earnings, cost of doing business and profitability. We seek to manage these risks through maintaining vigilance over our cost structure and delivering on our strategy to grow earnings and profitability.

Further, geopolitical tensions and actions of nation states, including trade wars, territorial disputes, incursions, and war may adversely impact Metcash's operations and supply chain, resulting in delay or unavailability of certain products or inputs, increased cost of doing business and subsequent impact on profitability. We seek to manage these risks through forecasting and planning to maintain adequate levels of supply, as well as understanding alternative avenues of supply.

# Operational risks

As Australia's leading wholesaler, Metcash is reliant upon the success of its suppliers and retailers. Metcash continues to invest in programs to improve the health of the independent retail network and improving Metcash's infrastructure to make it simpler to do business. These programs aim to strengthen Metcash as the business partner of choice for both its suppliers and retailers. As with any significant change, there is a risk that these transformation programs fail to deliver the expected benefits. Metcash has strengthened its governance frameworks to manage these change programs through the establishment of dedicated project teams to ensure projects are delivered and risks are addressed in a timely manner.

Disruption to, or inefficiency or failure within Metcash's supply chain, product sourcing ability, or of key support systems could impact the Group's ability to deliver on its objectives, its operational capability and financial performance. We seek to manage this risk through the ongoing monitoring of our operations to ensure our supply chain and support systems are able to scale appropriately to respond to business needs.

# Regulation and compliance risks

Metcash's operations require compliance with various legal and regulatory requirements including work health and safety, food and product safety, environmental regulations, workplace industrial relations, public liability, privacy and security, financial regulations and disclosure and reporting. Any regulatory breach could have a material negative impact on the reputation or financial results of Metcash or its stakeholders. Non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations could expose Metcash to fines, penalties, investigations, liabilities and reputation impacts. The Group's internal processes are periodically assessed and tested as part of risk and assurance programs.

The introduction of new laws and regulations, or reform to existing structures, or increases in levies to fund government schemes and regulations, could materially impact Metcash's operational and financial performance, through increased expenditure on compliance and controls and any required adjustments to how we conduct business.

# Property and facilities risk

Metcash leases facilities for the wholesale distribution of grocery, fresh produce, liquor, hardware and other fast-moving consumer goods. Damage to or destruction of these facilities could result in the loss or reduction of distribution capability and hence adversely impact Metcash's financial results. While Metcash has in place insurances that it considers are sufficient for a business of its type and size, Metcash will be required to pay for the loss on any event up to the deductible and self-insurance retention.

# Financial risks

Metcash's ability to reduce its cost of doing business is critical to support independent retailers in remaining competitive in the continued challenging environment. Competitive trading conditions and broader adverse economic conditions can increase the credit risk associated with the Group's activities. Metcash's strategy is to support successful independents through appropriate credit management processes.

Funding and liquidity risk continue to be relevant to the Group due to the need to adequately fund business operations, growth initiatives and absorb potential loss events that may arise. Inability to adequately fund the Group's business operations and growth plans may lead to difficulty in executing the Group's strategy. Metcash maintains a prudent approach towards capital management, which includes optimising working capital, targeted capital expenditure, capital and asset recycling and careful consideration of its dividend policy.

In an economic environment of high inflation and higher interest rates, Metcash may be impacted by increases in the cost of debt and potential instability in international banking markets. This could lead to a risk that the Group may be unable to refinance or renew its banking and debt facilities following expiry, or will only be able to refinance or renew those facilities on terms that are less favourable to the Group than existing terms. Further, if Metcash failed to meet any of the covenants on its debt facilities there is a risk that the Group may be required to repay outstanding debt on notice or take other actions to remedy the breach. Any requirement to repay outstanding debt on notice, or inability to refinance banking facilities or obtain capital or financing generally, on favourable terms or at all, may have a material adverse effect on the Group's financial performance and position. We seek to manage these risks through maintaining diversity in our banking partners, the value and tenor of debt facilities we hold, including maintaining sufficient headroom, and managing our financial and operational performance to ensure ongoing compliance with debt covenants.

The Group's financial risk management framework is discussed in further detail in note 5.6 of the financial statements.

# DIRECTORS' REPORT CONTINUED

# Trading and customer risks

Metcash's ability to operate efficiently is critical to support independent retailers in remaining competitive. A disruption to the business could result in an increased cost to serve retailers and inability to meet customers' requirements.

Tobacco sales represent a significant proportion of the products Metcash supplies to its independent retailers, however healthy living trends, cost of living pressures and supply of illicit tobacco in the Australian market may impact sales. Metcash continues to achieve gains from price increases on tobacco stock sales, which are commonly linked to the consumer price index.

In our Food pillar, Metcash services a number of large customers known as Multiple Store Owners (MSOs). These customers own and/or operate more than one independent retail store, and in some cases can own and/or operate a sizeable number of stores (examples of larger MSOs include Ritchies Stores Pty Ltd (Ritchies), Romeo Retail Group and Drakes Supermarkets). In addition, Metcash Food is a supplier to a number of contract customers, one of which is Australian United Retailers (AUR), which operates the Foodworks Bannered network. In 2022, Metcash entered into an agreement to supply AUR for a further five years commencing 1 July 2022. Metcash also extended the term of its agreement to supply Drakes Supermarkets stores in Queensland for a further five years, to 3 June 2029. If any one or more MSOs or AUR were to materially reduce or cease to source their inventory from Metcash for any reason (including vertically integrating their supply chain, establishing an alternative buying group, purchasing from another source, entering into a supply agreement with a competitor or closure of stores due to insolvency or poor performance), this would adversely impact Metcash's long-term performance and profitability.

In addition, there are certain large contract customers in the Liquor business whose contracts are renewed on a regular basis. If one or more of these contract customers decided not to renew their supply contract this too could adversely impact Metcash's long-term performance and profitability. Further, the Liquor business also has a number of large suppliers and if one or more of these suppliers decided to no longer conduct business with Metcash, this too could adversely impact Metcash's long-term performance and profitability.

We seek to manage these risks by building and maintaining strong relationships with our retailers, helping our retailers be the best store in their town, and striving to be our retailer's and supplier's business partner of choice; underpinned by an effective and efficient wholesale and logistics supply chain.

# Technology and cyber security risks

Metcash relies on a number of complex information technology systems to support its warehousing and distribution, supply chain, customer service, marketing and finance operations. A severe disruption to the information technology systems may significantly impact the operations and value of Metcash. Metcash is embarking on a business transformation program called Project Horizon which will replace older technology, reducing operational risk and onerous maintenance costs.

With expanding information privacy and security regulations, and an increasingly hostile cyber environment, Metcash recognises information privacy and cyber security as an increasing risk. Any impact on the availability, integrity or confidentiality of data could result in a breach of privacy and security regulations and/or impact Metcash's commercially sensitive information, which could expose Metcash to penalties (including financial penalties) and could adversely affect Metcash's operating and financial position or cause reputational harm. We seek to manage this risk through a suite of cyber and information security controls, including preventative and detective measures to manage exposure to cyber threats.

# Social responsibility, environment and climate change risks

Metcash is committed to ‘Championing successful independents’ and a key element of this is underpinned by ensuring its operations are conducted in a socially responsible manner.

Metcash has a moderate exposure to environmental risks. Metcash's operations could be impacted by natural disasters, extreme weather events or other catastrophic events which could materially disrupt its operations and supply chain. There is also a risk that, with time, the frequency and intensity of natural disasters and extreme weather events may increase if anthropogenic climate change accelerates or worsens.

Metcash is conscious of the impact its operations may have on the environment given the breadth of our operations across Australia. Although Metcash is only a moderate emitter of carbon emissions relative to its peers, we have set a science-based target to reduce our carbon emissions by  $42\%$  by 2030. In addition, Metcash seeks to reduce its environmental impact through programs and initiatives that manage its energy consumption and waste.

Metcash conducted a climate change risk assessment in line with guidelines from the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which considered the physical and transitional risks of climate change on the Group's operations. The main drivers of physical climate change risk for Metcash are the potential increase in frequency and severity of acute climate change events, such as bushfires, drought, floods, extreme storms and cyclones. The assessment concluded that the highest inherent rated risk is likely to be an increase in insurance premiums year on year. Other lower rated inherent rated risks include: damage to facilities and equipment, a temporary increase in costs to service our retailers during these events, a temporary disruption to our supply chain and distribution network, reduced availability and quality of fresh products, a decrease in the availability of timber products due to the impact of bushfires. Regarding transitional risks, the assessment found there are medium level transition risks, including potential reputational damage should Metcash not meet stakeholder expectations on climate management, and additional compliance costs should government introduce new greenhouse gas emission regulations or laws. For further information on how we manage environmental risks please refer to our most recent Sustainability Report available on our website.

Metcash has a low to moderate exposure to social risks. Our business and our people are driven by our purpose of ‘Championing successful independents’, and Metcash is proud to support independent retailers who are at the heart of local communities across Australia. At the core of our Purpose and Vision are our Values – we believe that independence is worth fighting for; in treating our people, retailers and suppliers the way we like to be treated; and in giving back to the communities where we live and work.

Metcash contributes to our local communities through the IGA Community Chest Program, disaster relief, and through our partnership with Foodbank. In addition, Metcash maintains an unwavering commitment to supporting remote communities through its partnership with The Arnhem Land Progress Aboriginal Corporation (ALPA) and the Outback Stores in the Northern Territory, to deliver improved affordability of food supply and the best possible outcomes for those communities.

Metcash meets the threshold for reporting under the Modern Slavery Act 2018 (Cth) with our most recent statement available at modernslaveryregister.gov.au and our Anti-Slavery Policy is available on our website. Metcash is taking steps to continually improve its exposure to modern slavery risks in its supply chain. Further, under recent amendments to the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018 (Cth), Metcash has been declared a ‘critical food and grocery asset’, which will require it to implement certain measures to meet compliance with the Act. For further information on how we manage social risks please refer to our Sustainability Report.

# Work health and safety risk

Metcash is focused on the safety of its staff and customers. While a strong emphasis is placed on the implementation of work health and safety standards, the risk of injury, including psychosocial harm, or fatality remains possible. The occurrence of such events may have an adverse effect on the safety and wellbeing of our people and the productivity, operations and reputation of Metcash. We seek to manage this risk through our Safety Health and Environment strategy and execution of initiatives to improve the safety and wellbeing of our people.

# People and culture risks

The increasing competitive landscape and low levels of unemployment continues to place pressure on the competition for talent and labour capacity and the ability to efficiently operate our business. The ability to attract and retain talent with the necessary skills and capabilities to operate in a challenging market whilst being able to effect transformation is critical to Metcash's success. Similarly, the ability to attract and retain employees to meet our labour capacity needs is crucial for our operational capability and efficiency. Metcash competes in labour markets to attract and retain its employees and management team. The competitive nature of these labour markets may result in the loss of key employees and/or labour capacity which may make it more difficult and costly to attract or retain employees. If Metcash is unable to attract and retain employees, this may adversely affect the Group's operations and overall financial performance.

Interruptions at Metcash's workplaces arising from industrial disputes, work stoppages and accidents may result in production losses and delays. Renegotiation of collective agreements may increase Metcash's operating costs and may involve disputes. We seek to manage these risks through ongoing engagement with our people and unions and implementing safety measures to minimise the likelihood and impact of accidents.

Metcash is committed to being a favourite place to work by unlocking the potential of its people through empowerment and ensuring the Group's cultural values align with their values. Integrity is the foundation of the ethical values and standards of behaviour set for all employees through the Group's Code of Conduct.

Metcash invests in its people through training and development opportunities, by promoting diversity and workplace flexibility and maintaining succession planning. The short and long-term incentive schemes align the Group's remuneration structure to shareholders' interests.

# REMUNERATION REPORT

On behalf of the Board and the People and Culture Committee, I am pleased to present our Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 April 2023

It is pleasing to report that, after a number of years of outstanding performance, sales have continued to grow over the year in a volatile market, leading to another strong uplift in underlying earnings and returns to shareholders. Continued growth over this financial year could not have been possible without the ongoing dedication and commitment of our people. We remain proud of how our leaders, team members, and members of our network have maintained momentum in uncertain economic times. Our people have worked exceptionally hard over the past year to deliver the best possible support for our retailers and their communities.

The health and wellbeing of our people has continued to be a critical priority for us. We have continued the active support of team members over the last year, not only through ongoing recognition, but also by investing in strong preventative health and safety measures and wellbeing programs.

# Our remuneration framework

At Metcash, we are passionate about Championing Successful Independents, attracting, motivating, and retaining key talent who drive sustainable company performance while embodying our Purpose, Vision, and Values. Our executive pay comprises Fixed Pay, Short-Term Incentive ('STI') and Long-Term Incentive ('LTI') components and is designed to ensure that executives have a significant proportion of remuneration at risk, which is payable on the delivery of positive outcomes for shareholders. No significant changes were made to our executive remuneration structure in FY23.

We continue our practice of undertaking an annual, detailed market benchmarking review for our director fees and executive pay, comparing fixed and variable rewards with data sourced through Aon in their capacity as an independent specialist remuneration data provider. Each Metcash position is benchmarked against similar roles in our peer group, which includes ASX listed organisations in a similar industry, both larger and smaller than Metcash, and across measures of market capitalisation, revenue, assets, and complexity. Our target position against our peer group remains the 50th percentile, however our framework also enables the recognition of deeply experienced, high performing individuals.

As a reminder, we commissioned in FY20 independent reviews of our benchmarking methodology and our remuneration practices and remain confident that our approach is sound, with strong researched correlations between the selected metrics for identifying our benchmarking peer group and the benchmark data we use for the annual review of fees and salaries.

Metcash aims to position itself at the mid-point of the benchmarking peer group, but due to the Group's outstanding performance over the past few years, the position to peer group has shifted above the 55th percentile. As a result, Aon recommended for FY24 the benchmarking

peer group be adjusted so that Metcash could maintain a mid-point position. This adjustment will apply to fees and salary benchmarks for use in the FY24 reviews and we anticipate that actual fees and salaries may require adjustment in FY24 to ensure remuneration rewards remain market competitive.

This year, we have taken the opportunity to review our Short-Term Incentive ('STI') deferral practices. From FY24, we will increase the Group Chief Executive Officer's ('Group CEO') STI deferral from  $33\%$  to  $40\%$ , with a further increase to  $50\%$  in FY25. For the Group Chief Financial Officer ('Group CFO'), we will increase the STI deferral from  $25\%$  to  $33\%$  in FY24, with further increases to  $40\%$  and  $50\%$  in FY25 and FY26 respectively.

# Our performance and outcomes

Our FY23 results are again outstanding, with another record year, representing continued progress on the exceptional performance in FY21 and FY22. Our Pillars continued to respond proactively to the significant challenges from COVID-19 and the uncertainty created by global economic trends that have impacted our local markets, including the challenges presented by price inflation and consumer sentiment. We have maintained focus on executing our  $\text{MFuture}$  plans to further improve the competitiveness of our independent retail networks.

We have worked hard to attract new, and retain returning shoppers, and are delighted at our record sales performance again this year. Group revenue (excluding charge-through sales) increased \(6.2\%\) to \(15.8 billion on a 52-week normalised basis. Including charge-through sales, Group revenue increased \(5.7\%\) to \(\$18.1\) billion on a 52-week normalised basis with strong sales growth in all Pillars. The uplift in sales, together with our strong focus on costs led to EBIT increasing a solid \(8.1\%\) to \(\$500.8\) million normalised. Underlying net profit after tax increased \(4.6\%\) to \(\$307.5\) million normalised and was \(\$259.0\) million on a statutory basis. Underlying earnings per share increased \(6.4\%\) to 31.8 cents normalised. Furthermore, we will distribute \(\$217.2\) million to shareholders in dividends in relation to the FY23 year.

In addition to the standout financial performance, there was ongoing improvement in the Company's ESG credentials as outlined in the Company's FY23 results presentation, with further detail to be provided in this year's Sustainability Report.

As part of the annual Aon pay benchmarking review, some changes to KMP Fixed Pay occurred in FY23 in line with market movement and individual performance and accountability.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/8c196416-8957-4912-88a8-22a94300c5af/d1d68e2b10733fd26a52d5648ab487795e9c5a1860272cb585d713bea50900de.jpg)

With the appointment of Mr Jones in late FY22, there were no changes to the Group CEO remuneration in FY23 as the Total Remuneration package was well balanced to the market median. We foreshadow salary adjustments in subsequent years, and we are working to increase pay at risk through incentive plans and align with market best practice with deferrals.

Based on strong performance in his first year in the role, the first tranche of the Group CEO's buy-out grant vested and ordinary shares were issued in March 2023. As a reminder, the buy-out grant (issued as performance rights, with performance hurdles for testing in 2023 and 2024) covered a portion of his forfeited entitlements when he joined Metcash.

Based on continued exceptional performance, business outcomes and deepening experience, the CEO Food's remuneration increased by  $10\%$  to take his package towards the  $75^{\text{th}}$  percentile of the market. In recognition of the criticality of the CEO Food during a period of transition between Group CEOs, a retention and performance plan was put in place in October 2021, with performance testing periods after year one, two and three. The smallest tranche at  $20\%$  of the total value of the incentive was performance tested in October 2022 and vested as ordinary shares. Regrettably, the CEO Food resigned from Metcash in January 2023 and the remainder of his retention and performance incentive will lapse. We recently announced the internal appointment of a new CEO Food who commenced in the role on 1 May 2023, and the remuneration target for this team member has been set appropriately for a first Group Executive role.

A modest increase was awarded to each of the Group CFO and the CEOs of Liquor and Hardware, maintaining their pay position to market medians.

Most Metcash Board fees remained below peer group medians and a modest increase of  $3\%$  took some slightly closer to and others slightly above the FY23 market medians. With his retirement pending, the Chair of the Board did not receive an increase to his fees in FY23. On appointment, the incoming Chair's fees were set at the market median and were subsequently lower than those of his predecessor.

STI outcomes for KMP are based on pool and scorecard results and ranged from  $65\%$  to  $84\%$  of maximum, reflecting another outstanding performance.

In FY22, our frontline teams were operating under the significant pressures of COVID-19 and the decision was taken not to put further strain on our operational teams by distracting them with a widespread and full engagement survey. Consequently, in FY23, we were only able to secure comparable engagement results for our monthly-paid team members, as is reported above. This year's engagement survey was a comprehensive one and gives us a new baseline for comparative results across our entire workforce in FY24.

Our FY21 LTI vested at  $100\%$  reflecting an excellent Return on Funds Employed (ROFE) outcome of  $29.8\%$ , representing an average of the ROFE in each of the three financial years in the performance period and an absolute total shareholder return (aTSR) of  $21.0\%$ , representing growth of  $74.8\%$  in our share price and dividends over the three-year performance period ended 30 April 2023.

For non-KMP team members, we have also rewarded performance in keeping with our 'pay for performance' principles, with our exceptional performers consistently receiving higher merit increases and incentive payments. To maintain our outstanding record of paying equitably, we again ensured those sitting lower in our salary bands, our more junior team members, and those whose pay was lower than their colleagues of a different gender received higher increases.

I am very pleased to advise that Metcash has received awards this year for its flexible working practices.

Overall, I believe our remuneration framework and outcomes for the year deliver a balanced and equitable outcome for all stakeholders.

Following positive feedback about the changes we previously made to this Report, we have again retained its structure and high level of disclosure. I trust you continue to find the Report informative.

# DIRECTORS' REPORT CONTINUED

# 2. REMUNERATION GOVERNANCE

The following diagram illustrates Metcash's remuneration governance framework.

# BOARD

The Board is responsible for overseeing and approving recommendations from the People and Culture Committee and Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee. The Board ultimately approve the remuneration outcomes for the Group CEO and other KMP.

# AUDIT, RISK AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE (‘ARCC’)

The ARCC support the P&CC by reviewing the Group's financial results which form the basis for STI and LTI awards and providing advice relating to material risk and accounting issues that may affect the Board's deliberations in determining STI and LTI award outcomes.

# PEOPLE AND CULTURE COMMITTEE (P&CC)

The P&CC is the key governing body in respect of remuneration matters. In addition to Non-executive Director and executive remuneration, the P&CC oversee major people-related programs such as culture and diversity, equity, and inclusion. The P&CC make recommendations to the Board based on its review of proposals received from management.

# MANAGEMENT

Provides information relevant to people and remuneration decisions and makes recommendations to the P&CC. Undertakes work as directed by the P&CC including obtaining information from external advisers to assist the Committee with decision making.

# EXTERNAL ADVISERS

The Committee may commission external advisers to provide information and/or recommendations on remuneration. If recommendations are sought in respect of KMP remuneration, interaction with external advisers is governed by protocol, which ensures the Committee can obtain independent advice. The Committee Chair appoints and engages directly with external advisers on KMP remuneration matters. Further, remuneration recommendations obtained from external advisers are used as a guide, rather than as a substitute for the Committee's thorough consideration of the relevant matters. The Committee consider the recommendations, along with other relevant factors, in making remuneration decisions. Both the Committee and the Board are satisfied that the existing protocols ensure that remuneration recommendations obtained from external advisers are free from undue influence from the KMP to whom the remuneration recommendations apply.

The People & Culture Committee engage and consider advice from independent remuneration consultants where appropriate in relation to remuneration matters and Non-executive Director fees. During the year, no remuneration recommendations as defined in section 9B of the Corporations Act 2001 were provided.

# 4. INCENTIVE PLAN OPERATION

# 4.1 'At-risk' STI plan

The 'at-risk' STI plan provides executives the opportunity to earn an incentive that is contingent upon performance against a combination of agreed financial and non-financial performance targets, which are set by the Board in consultation with the Group CEO at the start of each financial year.

The maximum reward is only paid on achievement of 'stretch' outcomes, which include:

Maximum achievement against Group and/or pillar EBIT financial performance hurdles, as applicable ('STI pool');  
Maximum achievement in overall individual performance results against all financial and all non-financial measures contained in the individual's Balanced Scorecard; and  
- An exceptional or successful rating against Metcash's behaviours framework.

Target setting  

<table><tr><td>Challenging performance targets are set against each performance measure following a rigorous budget setting process that considers many factors including market conditions. This process includes draft budgets being initially prepared by leadership teams, followed by Pillar CEO and CFO reviews. Once these reviews are complete, including the Pillar CEO and CFO being confident in them, these draft budgets are thoroughly reviewed and challenged by the Group CEO and Group CFO. Following satisfaction at this level, each Pillar presents the draft budgets to the Board over a two-day process during which they are challenged on all matters to ensure the Board is comfortable that the budgets are sufficiently challenging and achievable.</td></tr></table>

Following an exceptional year in FY22, the Group and the pillars have continued to deliver strong EBIT results in FY23. The pillars have delivered EBIT results at 'maximum'/'above target' vesting level with Group EBIT increasing  $6.0\%$  on FY22 outcomes. Accordingly, the STI outcomes awarded to KMP ranged from  $65\%$  to  $84\%$  of maximum.

In FY22, the Group and the pillars delivered exceptional EBIT results. All pillars delivered EBIT results above the 'maximum' vesting level with Group EBIT increasing  $17.7\%$  on FY21 outcomes. Accordingly, the STI outcomes awarded to KMP ranged from  $73\%$  to  $85\%$  of maximum.

In FY21, the Group and the pillars performed exceptionally well, delivering EBIT results against already stretching targets at a  $19.9\%$  increase on FY20 outcomes in extremely challenging circumstances.

In FY20, whilst the Group and the Food pillar delivered strong EBIT results, the Board exercised its discretion to reduce the overall STI award to the 'on target' level. The Liquor pillar was determined to have performed 'on target' and the Hardware pillar 'below target'.

In FY19, the Group delivered EBIT results that were marginally above target level. The Food and Hardware pillars performed marginally above target level and the Liquor pillar performed at target.

# FY23 STI outcomes

Metcash's performance in FY23 exceeded expectations, driven by a strong performance by our executive team.

The overall Group including the Food and Liquor pillars delivered strong results, resulting in a stretch performance against their respective STI measures. The Hardware pillar delivered a solid above target result. This resulted in the STI pools being funded at those levels.

As outlined on the following page, these financial results combined with KMP meeting or exceeding expectations against their overall individual objectives resulted in STI outcomes ranging from  $65\%$  to  $84\%$  of maximum. Across the KMP, performance against a number of targets, mainly non-financial targets, while being solid, were below target in the balanced scorecard which adversely affected their overall STI reward.

The Board view these FY23 STI outcomes as an appropriate recognition of the KMP's performance. This outcome also recognises that FY23 performance was reflected in strong outcomes for shareholders, customers, and the broader workforce (who were also eligible for comparable bonus payments in FY23).

The number of performance rights were calculated by dividing  $33\%$  (Group CEO) and  $25\%$  (other KMP) of the FY22 STI award dollar value by the VWAP of Metcash ordinary shares over the 20 trading days ended 30 April 2022 of $4.65 per share. The FY22 STI deferred equity component subsequently vested on 15 April 2023 following the KMP's completion of the service condition. These performance rights have now been released as shares and are restricted for trading until the close of 26 June 2023.

<table><tr><td>Performance condition</td><td>Weighting</td><td>Performance result</td><td>Vesting result (%)</td></tr><tr><td>ROFE</td><td>50%</td><td>ROFE performance over the three-year plan period was 29.8%</td><td>100%</td></tr><tr><td>ATSR</td><td>50%</td><td>ATSR CAGR performance over the three-year plan period was 21.0%</td><td>100%</td></tr></table>

3 Mr Marshall resigned as CEO Food effective 27 January 2023 and ceased employment on 23 June 2023. In FY23, Mr Marshall was issued 129,032 performance rights in relation to the FY23-FY25 grant, which will be forfeited upon cessation of his employment.

The ROFE vesting scale ranged from  $23.2\%$  (threshold  $25\%$  vesting) to  $26\%$  (maximum  $100\%$  vesting). The TSR vesting scale ranged from  $6\%$  CAGR (threshold  $25\%$  vesting) to  $10\%$  CAGR (maximum  $100\%$  vesting). Vesting occurs on a straight-line basis between each hurdle, with nil vesting below threshold. Full vesting only occurs if Metcash achieves a ROFE of greater than  $26\%$  and TSR CAGR of greater than  $10\%$  over the performance period.

The Board applied their customary diligence when performance testing this LTI grant and ensured that all significant items were prudently considered, before determining  $100\%$  vesting outcomes. Significant items primarily comprised valuation adjustments related to the Total Tools put options, Mega Distribution Centre transition costs and non-capitalisable Project Horizon implementation costs which included resource costs, accelerated amortisation of legacy software assets and incremental software licence and maintenance costs.

# DIRECTORS' REPORT CONTINUED

# 8. NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR REMUNERATION

# Remuneration policy

The objectives of Metcash's policy regarding Non-executive Director fees are:

- To preserve the independence of Non-executive Directors by not including any performance-related element; and  
- To be market competitive with regard to Non-executive Director fees in comparable ASX-listed companies and to the time and professional commitment in discharging the responsibilities of the role.

All Non-executive Directors are paid a fixed annual fee. In addition, Committee fees are paid to recognise the additional responsibilities associated with participating on a Board Committee. The fixed fee to the Board Chair is to remunerate the Chair for all responsibilities, including participating on any Board Committees.

To align individual interests with shareholders' interests, Non-executive Directors are encouraged to hold Metcash shares. Non-executive Directors fund their own share purchases and must comply with Metcash's share trading policy.

# Aggregate fee limit

Non-executive Director fees are limited to a maximum aggregate amount approved by shareholders. The current limit of $2,000,000 was approved in 2021.

# Minimum shareholding guidelines

Minimum shareholding guidelines have been implemented for all Non-executive Directors of one year's base fees to be accumulated in five years from the effective date of 1 May 2019 or upon their date of appointment as a Non-executive Director, whichever occurs later.

# Non-executive Director fee structure

Consistent with all executive remuneration practices in Metcash, extensive annual independent data benchmarking is undertaken on Board fees. In FY23, an increase in fees of  $3.0\%$  was made, which moves the position to between  $94\%$  and  $110\%$  of the market benchmark.

During the year, a total 1,696,720 shares and 279,808 shares were acquired on market in relation to the vesting of the FY20-FY22 LTI grant and FY22 STI deferred equity component, respectively, and these shares were issued to employees and executives. There were no other shares issued to employees or executives during or since the end of the financial year in respect of the exercise of options or performance rights.

# Indemnification of Auditors

Pursuant to the terms of engagement the Company has with its auditors, EY Australia, the Company has agreed to indemnify EY Australia to the extent permitted by law and professional regulations, against any losses, liabilities, costs or expenses incurred by EY Australia where they arise out of or occur in relation to any negligent, wrongful or wilful act or omission by the Company. No payment has been made to EY Australia by the Company pursuant to this indemnity, either during or since the end of the financial year.

# Non-audit services

Details of the non-audit services undertaken by, and amounts paid to the Company's auditor, EY Australia are detailed in note 7.2 of the financial statements.

The Directors are satisfied that the provision of non-audit services is compatible with the general standard of independence for auditors imposed by the Corporations Act 2001. The nature and scope of each type of non-audit service provided means that auditor independence was not compromised.

The auditor's independence declaration for the year ended 30 April 2023 has been received and is included on page 115.

# Subsequent events

There were no events that have occurred after the end of the financial year that would materially affect the reported results or would require disclosure in this report.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 APRIL 2023 CONTINUED

# 1. CORPORATE INFORMATION

The financial statements of Metcash Limited (the 'Company') and its controlled entities (together the 'Group') for the year ended 30 April 23 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 26 June 2023.

Metcash Limited is a for-profit company limited by ordinary shares incorporated and domiciled in Australia whose shares are publicly traded on the Australian Securities Exchange. The nature of the operations and principal activities of the Group are described in the Directors' Report. The registered office of the Company is 1 Thomas Holt Drive, Macquarie Park NSW 2113.

# 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES

# 2.1 Basis of preparation

The financial statements are a general-purpose financial report that has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and Australian Accounting Standards and other authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board.

The financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments and share-based payments which are measured at fair value.

The financial statements are presented in Australian dollars and all values are rounded to the nearest $100,000 unless otherwise stated under the option available to the Company under ASIC Corporations Instrument 2016/191. The Company is an entity to which the legislative instrument applies.

The financial statements comply with Australian Accounting Standards. The financial statements also comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).

The current financial year comprises a 52-week period that commenced on 2 May 2022 and ended on 30 April 2023. The prior financial year comprised a 53-week period that commenced on 26 April 2021 and ended on 1 May 2022.

Certain comparative information was amended in these financial statements to conform to the current year presentation. These amendments do not impact the Group's financial results and do not have any significant impact on the Group's balance sheet.

# 2.2 Changes in accounting policy

The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous period, other than the revision to the accounting policy choice adopted in relation to the remeasurement of lease receivables. Subsequent to initial recognition, lease receivables are to be remeasured for changes in future cash flows resulting from a change in an index or rate or variable lease payments becoming fixed. The revised accounting policy choice was adopted in order to better reflect the effect of these transactions in back-to-back lease arrangements, such that the accounting for lease receivables is consistent with the treatment of lease liabilities in these circumstances.

The revised accounting policy choice has been applied retrospectively and there was no material impact from a quantitative or qualitative perspective.

There are no accounting pronouncements which have become effective from 1 May 2022 that have a significant impact on the Group's financial report. Refer to Appendix A for new or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations.

# 2.3 Significant accounting policies

# 2.3.1 Basis of consolidation

# Controlled entities

The financial statements comprise the consolidated financial statements of Metcash Limited and its controlled entities for the year ended 30 April 2023. Refer to Appendix B for a list of controlled entities.

Controlled entities are all those entities over which the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.

# Consolidation procedures

Controlled entities are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in full.

Non-controlling interests are allocated their share of total comprehensive income and are presented as a separate category within equity.

The financial statements of controlled entities are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent entity, using consistent accounting policies. For those controlled entities with non-coterminous year-ends, management accounts for the relevant period to the Group's reporting date have been consolidated. In the opinion of the Directors, the expense of providing additional coterminous statutory accounts, together with consequential delay in producing the Group's financial statements, would outweigh any benefit to shareholders.

# Separate financial statements

Investments in entities controlled by Metcash Limited are accounted for at cost in the separate financial statements of the parent entity less any impairment charges. Dividends received from controlled entities are recorded as income in the separate financial statements of the parent entity, and do not impact the recorded cost of the investment unless the dividends effectively represent a return of capital.

# 2.4 Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions

The Group has incorporated judgements, estimates and assumptions in determining the amounts recognised in the financial statements based on conditions existing at balance date.

# 2.4.1 Significant accounting judgements

In the process of applying the Group's accounting policies, the following judgements were made, apart from those involving estimations, which have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.

<table><tr><td>Note</td><td>Areas</td><td>Judgements</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Note 3.2</td><td rowspan="2">Sales revenue</td><td>- Charge-through sales - In addition to warehouse purchases, customers purchase goods through the Group&#x27;s charge-through platform and have these goods delivered directly to them from suppliers. The Group earns a margin on these sales for providing procurement, cross-docking and settlement services. The Group also bears credit risk on the receivables from these sales with limited recourse to suppliers.</td></tr><tr><td>- The Group determined that it is an agent in these contracts as it does not control the goods before they are being transferred to customers.</td></tr><tr><td>Note 4.2</td><td>Leases</td><td>- Determination of lease term of contracts with renewal options.</td></tr><tr><td>Note 4.3</td><td>Inventories</td><td>- Supplier rebate income - The recognition and measurement of supplier rebate income requires the use of judgement, due to a high degree of variability and complexity in arrangements with suppliers, and due to timing differences between stock purchases and the provision of promotional services.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Note 6.1</td><td rowspan="2">Business combinations</td><td>- Determining the existence of control, joint control or significant influence over the Group&#x27;s acquisitions. Where the Group exercises significant influence or joint control, the acquisitions are accounted for as equity accounted investments (note 4.4); and where the Group exercises control, the acquisitions are accounted for as business combinations.</td></tr><tr><td>- Determining the acquisition date fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on acquisition of controlled entities.</td></tr></table>

# 2.4.2 Significant accounting estimates

The carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities are often determined based on estimates and assumptions of future events. The key estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities within the next annual reporting period are:

<table><tr><td>Note</td><td>Areas</td><td>Estimates</td></tr><tr><td>Note 4.1</td><td>Trade receivables and loans</td><td>Allowance for impairment loss</td></tr><tr><td>Note 4.4</td><td>Equity-accounted investments</td><td>Assessment of recoverable amount</td></tr><tr><td>Note 4.7</td><td>Impairment of non-financial assets</td><td>Assessment of recoverable amount</td></tr><tr><td>Note 4.2 and 4.8</td><td>Provisions</td><td>Property provisions, restructuring</td></tr><tr><td>Note 5.3</td><td>Put option liabilities</td><td>Determining put option consideration including Total Tools and Ritchies</td></tr></table>

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 APRIL 2023 CONTINUED

# 3. GROUP PERFORMANCE

# 3.1 Segment information

The Group has identified its operating segments based on the internal reports that are reviewed and used by the Chief Executive Officer (the chief operating decision maker) in assessing performance and in determining the allocation of resources. Discrete financial information about these operating segments is reported on at least a monthly basis.

The information reported to the CEO is aggregated based on product types and the overall economic characteristics of industries in which the Group operates. The Group's reportable segments are therefore as follows:

- Food activities comprise the distribution of a range of products and services to independent supermarket and convenience retail outlets.  
- Hardware activities comprise the distribution of hardware products to independent retail outlets and the operation of company owned and joint venture retail stores.  
- Liquor activities comprise the distribution of liquor products to independent retail outlets and hotels.

The Group operates predominantly in Australia. The Group has operations in New Zealand that represent less than  $5\%$  of revenue, results and assets of the Group. The Group does not have a single customer which represents greater than  $10\%$  of the Group's revenue.

Sales between segments are based on similar terms and conditions to those in place with third party customers and are eliminated from the results below.

Segment results  

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">Segment revenue</td><td colspan="2">Segment results</td></tr><tr><td>FY23$m</td><td>FY22$m</td><td>FY23$m</td><td>FY22$m</td></tr><tr><td>Food</td><td>8,410.1</td><td>8,379.3</td><td>204.0</td><td>200.3</td></tr><tr><td>Hardware</td><td>2,344.1</td><td>2,033.1</td><td>219.2</td><td>191.3</td></tr><tr><td>Liquor</td><td>5,049.2</td><td>4,752.4</td><td>104.1</td><td>97.4</td></tr><tr><td>Segment total</td><td>15,803.4</td><td>15,164.8</td><td>527.3</td><td>489.0</td></tr><tr><td>Corporate</td><td></td><td></td><td>(26.5)</td><td>(16.7)</td></tr><tr><td>Group underlying earnings before interest and tax (&#x27;EBIT&#x27;)</td><td></td><td></td><td>500.8</td><td>472.3</td></tr><tr><td>Finance costs, net (Note 3.3)</td><td></td><td></td><td>(64.7)</td><td>(48.5)</td></tr><tr><td>Significant items (Note 3.3)</td><td></td><td></td><td>(59.6)</td><td>(65.6)</td></tr><tr><td>Profit before income tax</td><td></td><td></td><td>376.5</td><td>358.2</td></tr></table>

# 3.2 Sales revenue

# Sale of goods

The Group's revenue principally arises from the sale of goods within its wholesale distribution and retail operations. Sales revenue is recognised when the Group has delivered goods to its customers, and it is probable that consideration will be collected in exchange. Revenue is measured based on the consideration expected to be received, net of trade rebates.

# Charge-through sales

The Group operates a charge-through platform whereby goods are delivered directly to the Group's customers by suppliers. The Group retains the credit risk associated with these transactions; however, the Group does not bear any material inventory risk or exercise any material discretion in establishing prices. Charge-through transactions are therefore reported on an agency or net 'commission' basis with the gross sale value included in trade receivables and the gross purchase cost included in trade payables. Gross charge-through sales to customers during the year were  $2.249 billion (FY22:$ 2.241 billion).

# SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

# Finance costs

Finance costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset. All other finance costs are expensed in the period they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.

Certain provisions are measured at their discounted value. During each period the provision is increased by an amount that is equal to the provision multiplied by the discount rate. This increment, including any change in the value of the provision as a result of a change in discount rate, is treated as a finance cost.

# Project Horizon implementation costs

Project Horizon is a critical group technical infrastructure consolidation and replacement program aimed at repositioning Metcash to be a modern, technology-led wholesaler. The program provides the platform to drive simplification and efficiency across the business, as well as making it easier for customers and suppliers to do business with Metcash. The first deployments have been the finance and inventory forecasting and replenishment components, with the inventory forecasting and replenishment system delivering early benefits and significantly improving forecasting accuracy. The remaining components of the first stage are focused on accessing benefits within the Food and Liquor pillars.

The program is subject to continual assessment in relation to program governance, independent assurance, Board oversight and program risks. To further minimise risks to our customers and business and help ensure project outcomes are maximised, the expected completion date for stage 1 has been extended from the end of 2023 to the end of FY2025. The change in timeline has been supported by Metcash's ability to maintain its current systems longer than anticipated and does not result in a change to the expected capital expenditure of the project and a limited increase in operating project office expenses for the longer time frame.

In FY23, the Group incurred  $62.8 million (FY22:$ 46.9 million) of capital expenditure which comprised $60.2 million in relation to software assets and $2.6 million in relation to prepaid assets and $34.6 million (FY22: $31.4 million) of expenses on the project. The project expenses included resource costs, accelerated amortisation of legacy software assets and incremental software licence and maintenance costs. These costs are separately disclosed within significant items in the Statement of Comprehensive Income to enable a better understanding of the Group's results.

# Put option valuation and business acquisition costs

The carrying amounts of the Group's put option liabilities at balance date were remeasured to reflect the estimated put option exercise prices, with the change in value of  $17.5 million (FY22:$ 24.0 million) recorded as a significant item within the Statement of Comprehensive Income, together with the net present value interest unwind on the put option liabilities of $9.5 million (FY22: $5.4 million).

In addition, a loss of  $1.5 million was recognised upon the acquisition of an additional \(20\%$  ownership interest in two Total Tools JV Stores during the period, being the difference between the consideration paid to minority shareholders of \)9.2 million and the carrying amount of the put option held by the minority shareholders of $7.7 million. The Group also incurred transaction costs of $1.5 million in relation to the acquisition of Total Tools JV Stores in FY23. Refer note 6.1 for further details about the acquisitions.

# Mega Distribution Centre (DC) transition costs

The Group continues to invest in its mega DC's capacity, capabilities, footprint & supply chain systems to support current and future business opportunities. During the period, the Group incurred  $4.3 million (FY22:$ 0.9 million) of net costs primarily including lease tail and make good provisions associated with the planned move to the new DC in Truganina, Victoria as disclosed in Metcash's FY22 Financial Report. In FY22, the Group incurred $2.7 million of implementation costs related to the MFuture program.

# Impairment, net of reversals

In FY23, the Group recognised a $7.3 million (FY22: nil) reversal of impairment previously recognised in relation to its joint venture entity, Adcome Pty Ltd (Cornets) reflecting an increase in the estimated recoverable amount of the investment since the date the impairment loss was originally recognised in FY12.

In addition, an impairment reversal of  $2.0 million (FY22:$ 3.0 million impairment charge) was recognised reflecting a decrease in the expected credit losses previously recognised in relation to specific groups of trade receivables impacted by COVID-19 restrictions.

The Group has unrecognised gross capital losses of  $28.7 million (FY22:$ 19.5 million) that are available indefinitely for offset against future capital gains. During the year, the Group paid $151.7 million of income tax (FY22: $117.0 million). The income tax paid exceeded the level of income tax expense of $116.2 million (FY22: $111.1 million) largely as a result of balancing payments made during the current year arising from prior increases in deferred tax assets, as well as the subsequent associated increase in the income tax instalment rate.

# Tax consolidation

Metcash Limited and its  $100\%$  owned Australian resident subsidiaries formed a tax consolidated group with effect from 1 July 2005. Metcash Limited is the head entity of the tax consolidated group. Members of the group have entered into a tax sharing arrangement in order to allocate income tax expense to the wholly owned subsidiaries on a modified standalone basis. In addition, the agreement provides for the allocation of income tax liabilities between the entities should the head entity default on its tax payment obligations.

# Tax effect accounting by members of the tax consolidated group

Members of the tax consolidated group have entered into a tax funding agreement. The tax funding agreement provides for the allocation of current taxes to members of the tax consolidated group in accordance with a group allocation method using modified standalone tax calculations as the basis for allocation. Deferred taxes of members of the tax consolidated group are measured and recognised in accordance with the principles of AASB 112 Income Taxes.

Under the tax funding agreement, funding is based upon the amounts allocated and recognised by the member entities. Accordingly, funding results in an increase/decrease in the subsidiaries' intercompany accounts with the tax consolidated group head entity, Metcash Limited.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 APRIL 2023 CONTINUED

# SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authority. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the relevant reporting date.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward unused tax assets and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carryforward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised:

- except where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting nor taxable profit or loss; and  
- in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.

# SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basic earnings per share is calculated as net profit attributable to members of the parent, adjusted to exclude any costs of servicing equity (other than dividends) divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares, adjusted for any bonus element.

Diluted earnings per share are calculated as net profit attributable to members of the parent, adjusted for:

costs of servicing equity (other than dividends);  
- the after-tax effect of dividends and interest associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares that have been recognised as expenses; and  
- other non-discretionary changes in revenues or expenses during the period that would result from the dilution of potential ordinary shares, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares and dilutive potential ordinary shares, adjusted for any bonus element.

# Weighted average interest

Trade and other receivables are non-interest-bearing and repayment terms vary by pillar. As at 30 April 2023,  $5.5 million (FY22: nil) of customer loans are non-interest-bearing and$ 10.6 million (FY22: $21.4 million) of customer loans have a weighted average annual interest rate of 7.2% (FY22: 6.1%).

# Maturity of trade receivables

At 30 April 2023,  $89.2\%$  (FY22:  $90.3\%$ ) of trade receivables are either due or required to be settled within 30 days,  $9.7\%$  (FY22:  $8.7\%$ ) have terms extending from 30 to 60 days and  $1.1\%$  (FY22:  $1.0\%$ ) have terms greater than 60 days.

# Customer charge cards agreement

Under an agreement between Metcash and American Express (Amex), eligible retail customers make trade purchases from Metcash using their Amex customer charge cards. Metcash's trade receivable is settled in full by Amex. Amex subsequently collects the amounts outstanding on the customer charge cards directly from the retailers.

Under the agreement, in the event a customer defaults on their payment obligation to Amex, Metcash must reacquire the trade receivable from Amex. The maximum amount payable by Metcash to Amex is limited to the actual face value of the outstanding trade receivable and does not include any interest or any other costs incurred by Amex. Once reacquired, Metcash would seek to collect the trade receivable from the retail customer through its normal credit processes.

The agreement was renewed during the prior year and operates on an evergreen basis until either Metcash or Amex provides a 12-month notice of cancellation. The earliest date on which the agreement could be cancelled is 30 June 2025.

The customer charge cards agreement is presented as part of current trade and other receivables and a matching current liability of  $232.5 million (FY22:$ 235.9 million) is included within trade and other payables, with no impact to the Group's net asset position.

# Customer loan security

The Group has access to security against most customer loans in the event of default. Security held may include bank and personal guarantees, fixed and floating charges and security over property and other assets. Due to the large number and the varied nature of security held, their fair value cannot be practicably estimated. The fair value of the security against a loan is determined when the loan is not deemed to be recoverable and an allowance for impairment loss is raised to cover any deficit in recoverability.

# SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

# Trade receivables

Trade receivables are measured at the transaction price determined under the 'Sales Revenue' significant accounting policy (Note 3.2).

# Allowance for impairment loss

The Group recognises an allowance for impairment loss based on expected credit losses (ECL) for its trade and other receivables. The Group has established a provision rate matrix, under the simplified approach in calculating ECL, that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to a group of debtors and the economic environment.

# SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

# Allowance for impairment loss

The Group uses a provision rate matrix to calculate ECLs for receivables. The provision rates are initially based on the Group's historical observed default rates. The Group will calibrate the matrix to adjust the historical credit loss experience with forward-looking information (e.g., any known changes in market conditions with reference to the most recent gross domestic product data). At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.

The assessment of the correlation between historical observed default rates, forecast economic conditions and ECLs is a significant estimate. The amount of ECLs is sensitive to changes in circumstances and of forecast economic conditions. The Group's historical credit loss experience and forecast of economic conditions may also not be representative of customer's actual default in the future.

(f) In FY23, the Group recognised rent expense of  $13.4 million (FY22:$ 11.2 million) from short-term leases and variable lease payments.  
(g) Extension options are included in a number of lease contracts across the Group. These options are negotiated by management to provide flexibility in managing the leased-asset portfolio and align with the Group's business needs. The extension options are exercisable only by the Group and not by the lessors. The present value of lease payments to be made under these options that are considered reasonably certain to be exercised have been included in the lease liability balance at 30 April 2023. The undiscounted potential future payments at current rental rates under options that are not considered reasonably certain to be exercised is approximately $1.8 billion, which includes potential lease payments within the next five years of approximately $201.6 million.

# Group as a lessee

Right-of-use assets

The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement of a lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). The initial measurement of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are subsequently measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities.

Unless the Group is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term. Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment assessments under AASB 136 Impairment of Assets.

Depreciation

Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis on all right-of-use assets. Major depreciation periods are:

<table><tr><td></td><td>FY23</td><td>FY22</td></tr><tr><td>Leasehold properties</td><td>1-30 years</td><td>1-30 years</td></tr><tr><td>Motor vehicles and equipment</td><td>4-5 years</td><td>4-5 years</td></tr></table>

Useful lives are reassessed on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis.

# Lease liabilities

At the commencement of a lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include renewal periods where the Group is reasonably certain to exercise the renewal option. Outgoings and other variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as incurred.

In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset.

# Group as a lessor

Lease receivables

The Group enters into back-to-back lease agreements with independent retailers where the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the subslessee and these are classified as a finance lease.

Amounts due from finance leases are recognised as lease receivables at the amount of the Group's net investment in the lease. Lease receivables are subsequently remeasured if there is a change in the lease term and for changes in future cash flows resulting from a change in an index or rate or variable lease payments becoming fixed. Finance lease income is allocated to reporting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the Group's net investment outstanding in respect of the leases.

All other leases are classified as operating leases. Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.

# Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets

The Group applies a recognition exemption to leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option. It also applies a recognition exemption to leases that are considered of low value. Lease payments and rental income from short-term and low-value leases are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

# SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENT

# Determination of lease term of contracts with renewal options

The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.

After initial recognition, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise (or not to exercise) the option to renew.

# SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

# Property provisions

The Group recognises provisions for rental agreements on acquisition. In measuring these provisions, assumptions are made about future retail sales, rental costs and in determining the appropriate discount rate to be used in the cash flow calculations.

The Group has recognised a provision in accordance with the accounting policy described above. The Group assesses obligations on property make-good, restructuring and other costs. These estimates are determined using assumptions on property-related costs, redundancy and other closure or restructure costs.

# SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Inventory cost is measured at purchase price, net of trade rebates and discounts received, and including costs incurred in bringing the inventory to its present location and condition. Trade rebates include supplier rebate income, which is systematically allocated against inventory cost using estimates based on expected purchase patterns and earn rates.

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, net of estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

2. The Group has a direct ownership of  $26.0\%$  in LA United Pty Ltd, an indirect ownership of  $49.3\%$  via its interest in Liquor Alliance Pty Ltd. While the Group has beneficial ownership of more than  $50\%$  of the entity, key operating and financial decisions require the unanimous consent of other joint venture partners. Accordingly, LA United Pty Ltd and Liquor Alliance Pty Ltd are accounted for as joint arrangements.  
The principal place of business for all of the Group's equity-accounted investments is Australia, with the exception of Metcash Export Services Pty Ltd, which primarily deals with customers in China.

Refer note 7.3 for details of the Group's contingent liabilities in relation to equity-accounted investments.

# SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Equity-accounted investments of the Group represent both associates and joint ventures and are structured through equity participation in separate legal entities. Metcash invests capital to support the independent retail network, strengthen relationships and fund growth. Relationships with co-investors are governed by contractual agreements which allow the Group to exercise either significant influence or joint control over these entities. Where the Group exercises joint control, key operating decisions are agreed unanimously, regardless of ownership interest.

The Group's investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method. Associates are those entities over which the Group exercises significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies. A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.

Equity-accounted investments are carried in the statement of financial position at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group's share of net assets of the investee, less any impairment in value.

For those associates and joint ventures with non-coterminous year ends, management accounts for the relevant period to the Group's reporting date have been equity-accounted. In the opinion of the Directors, the expense of providing additional coterminous statutory accounts, together with consequential delay in producing the Group's financial statements, would outweigh any benefit to shareholders.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Impairment of equity-accounted investments

After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an impairment loss on its investment in its associate or joint venture. At each reporting date, the Group determines whether there is objective evidence that the investment in the associate or joint venture is impaired. If there is such evidence, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate or joint venture and its carrying value.

In assessing the recoverable amount, assumptions are made about the growth prospects of the investment and in determining the discount rate used to calculate the net present value of future cash flows when a discounted cash flow model is used.

An impairment loss recognised in prior periods is reversed if there has been a change in estimates used to determine the equity-accounted investments recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If this is the case, the carrying amount of the investment is increased to its recoverable amount, with the increase being recognised as a reversal of an impairment loss in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 APRIL 2023 CONTINUED

# SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

# Recognition and measurement

Intangible assets acquired separately or in a business combination are initially measured at cost. Following initial recognition, the cost model is applied to the class of intangible assets.

Intangible assets (excluding software development costs) created within the business are not capitalised and expenditure is charged against profits in the period in which the expenditure is incurred.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is initially measured at cost; being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group's interest in the net fair value of the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities.

Trade names are acquired either through business combinations or through direct acquisition. Trade names are recognised as intangible assets where a registered trademark is acquired with attributable value. Trade names are valued on a relief from royalty method. Trade names are considered to be indefinite life intangibles and are not amortised, unless there is an intention to discontinue use of the name in which case it is amortised over its estimated remaining useful life.

Customer contracts are acquired through business combinations. Customer contacts are recognised as intangible assets when the criteria specified in AASB 138 Intangible Assets have been met. Customer contracts are valued by applying a discounted cash flow valuation methodology with consideration given to customer retention and projected future cash flows to the end of the contract period. The amortisation has been recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.

Software development costs incurred on an individual project are capitalised at cost when future recoverability can reasonably be assured and where the Group has an intention and ability to use the asset. Following the initial recognition of software development costs, the asset is carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Any costs carried forward are amortised over the assets' useful economic lives.

Configuration and customisation costs incurred in implementing cloud-based arrangements are only capitalised if the implementation activities create an intangible asset that the Group controls in accordance with the requirements of AASB 138 Intangible Assets. Costs that do not result in intangible assets should be expensed as incurred. The exception is where they are paid to the suppliers of the cloud-based arrangement to significantly customise the cloud-based software for the Group. In this case, the costs are recorded as a prepayment for services and amortised over the expected renewable term of the arrangement.

# Derecognition

Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income when the asset is derecognised.

When goodwill forms part of a group of cash generating units and an operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the groups of cash-generating units retained.

# Useful lives

The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to either be finite or indefinite. Where amortisation is charged on assets with finite lives, this expense is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis.

The estimated useful lives of existing finite life intangible assets are as follows:

<table><tr><td></td><td>FY23</td><td>FY22</td></tr><tr><td>Customer contracts</td><td>15 years</td><td>15 years</td></tr><tr><td>Software development costs</td><td>5-10 years</td><td>5-10 years</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>10 years</td><td>10 years</td></tr></table>

Useful lives are reassessed on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis.

# 4.7 Impairment of non-financial assets

# Impairment tests for goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives

# Description of cash generating units

Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored, being the three cash generating units (or 'CGU's) - Food, Hardware and Liquor. Indefinite life intangibles primarily comprise trade names and licences.

# Allocation to CGUs

The carrying amounts of goodwill and indefinite life intangibles are allocated to the Group's CGUs as follows:

<table><tr><td></td><td colspan="2">Allocated goodwill</td><td colspan="2">Trade names and other intangibles</td><td colspan="2">Post-tax discount rates</td></tr><tr><td>Cash-generating units</td><td>FY23$m</td><td>FY22$m</td><td>FY23$m</td><td>FY22$m</td><td>FY23%</td><td>FY22%</td></tr><tr><td>Food</td><td>214.3</td><td>214.3</td><td>1.5</td><td>2.1</td><td>9.4%</td><td>10.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Hardware</td><td>248.5</td><td>210.3</td><td>58.6</td><td>58.6</td><td>9.4%</td><td>9.4%</td></tr><tr><td>Liquor</td><td>147.3</td><td>142.7</td><td>13.0</td><td>13.0</td><td>9.4%</td><td>9.4%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>610.1</td><td>567.3</td><td>73.1</td><td>73.7</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>

# Assessment of recoverable amounts

The recoverable amounts were determined based on value in use calculations using cash flow projections covering a five-year period, which are based on approved strategic plans or forecasts. Estimates beyond the five-year period are calculated using terminal growth rates that are applicable to the trading environment in which the CGU operates.

# Key assumptions used in assessment

The valuations used to support the carrying amounts of intangible assets are based on forward looking key assumptions that are, by nature, uncertain. The nature and basis of the key assumptions used to estimate future cash flows and the discount rates used in the projections, when determining the recoverable amount of each CGU, are set out below and in the table above:

- Operating cash flows - Operating cash flow projections are extracted from the most recent approved strategic plans or forecasts that relate to the existing asset base. For each CGU, the cash flow projections for a five-year period have been determined based on expectations of future performance. Key assumptions in the cash flows include sales volume growth, costs of sales and costs of doing business. These assumptions are based on expectations of market demand and operational performance.

Cash flow projections are based on risk-adjusted forecasts allowing for estimated changes in the business, the competitive trading environment, legislation and economic growth whilst noting that uncertainties remain over the potential impact of changes to consumer behaviour and other uncertainties surrounding macroeconomic indicators such as unemployment and GDP growth create future uncertainty over the Group's operating cash flows.

Discount rates - Discount rates are based on the weighted average cost of capital ('WACC') for the Group adjusted for an asset-specific risk premium assigned to each CGU. The asset-specific risk premium is determined based on risk embedded within the cash flow projections and other factors specific to the industries in which the CGUs operate.

The calculation of WACC is market-driven and key inputs include target capital structure, equity beta, market risk premium, risk-free rate of return and debt risk premium. Pre-tax equivalents of the adopted discount rates are derived iteratively and differ based on the timing and extent of tax cash flows. Pre-tax rates were  $13.4\%$  across all CGUs (FY22:  $15.1\%$  for Food and  $13.4\%$  for Hardware and Liquor).

- Terminal growth rates - Cash flows beyond the projection period are extrapolated indefinitely using estimated long-term growth rates applicable to the trading environment in which the CGUs operate. A terminal growth rate of  $2.5\%$  was applied to all CGUs.

# Results of assessment

Based on the FY23 assessment, no impairment of goodwill was identified in any of the Group's CGUs.

# Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions

At the assessment date, no reasonably likely change in key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of any CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 APRIL 2023 CONTINUED

# SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that the value of a non-financial asset may be impaired. Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.

Where an indicator of impairment exists, the Group makes a formal estimate of recoverable amount. Where the carrying amount of a non-financial asset exceeds its recoverable amount the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.

Recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. It is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset's value in use cannot be estimated to be close to its fair value less costs to sell and it does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. In this case, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU to which the asset belongs.

When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated pre-tax future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.

Impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

# SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

# Employee entitlements

Wages, salaries, incentives, annual leave and sick leave

Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits, incentives, annual leave and accumulating sick leave, are recognised in provisions in respect of employees' services up to the reporting date. They are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. Liabilities due to be settled within 12 months of the reporting date are classified as current liabilities. Liabilities for non-accumulating sick leave are recognised when the leave is taken and are measured at the rates paid or payable.

Long service leave

The liability for long service leave is recognised in the provision for employee benefits and measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures, and periods of service. Expected future payments at the reporting date are discounted using market yields on high-quality corporate bonds with terms to maturity that match as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows.

# Property provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

Property provisions include the value of certain retail store lease obligations recognised as part of the acquisition of Franklin in FY12. The provision is initially recognised at the acquisition date fair value and subsequently utilised to settle lease obligations. The provision related to an individual lease is derecognised when the Group has met or otherwise extinguished its obligations in full under that lease.

Provisions are also recognised for obligations such as guarantees, property make-good and other costs. Depending on the nature of these obligations, they are expected to be settled over the term of the lease, at the conclusion of the lease or otherwise when the obligation vests.

If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are measured at the net present value of the expected future cash outflows using a current pre-tax rate that reflects the risks specific to the liability. During each period the provision is increased by an amount that is equal to the provision multiplied by the discount rate. This increment, including any change in the value of the provision as a result of a change in discount rate, is treated as a finance cost.

# SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

# Property provisions

The Group recognises provisions for rental agreements on acquisition. In measuring these provisions, assumptions are made about future retail sales, rental costs and in determining the appropriate discount rate to be used in the cash flow calculations.

The Group assesses obligations on property make-good, restructuring and other costs. These estimates are determined using assumptions on property-related costs, redundancy and other closure or restructure costs.

# Financial covenants

Refer to note 5.6 for details of the Group's core borrowing facilities. The core borrowings of the Group must comply with two primary covenants which apply to the syndicated, bilateral and working capital bank facilities. They include a Fixed Charges Cover Ratio and a Senior Leverage Ratio. There were no defaults or breaches on the Group's core borrowings in FY23 and FY22.

# Weighted average interest

The weighted average effective interest rate on the syndicated, bilateral and working capital loans was  $3.7\%$  (FY22:  $1.7\%$ ), reflecting an average BBSY of  $2.55\%$  (FY22:  $0.17\%$ ) over the year. These rates exclude line fees on unutilised facility balances.

# Statement of Cashflows - Proceeds from and repayment of borrowings

The Statement of Cash Flows sets out the Group's proceeds from borrowings of  $4.50 billion (FY22:$ 1.43 billion), which includes gross proceeds from syndicated and bilateral loans of  $4.38 billion (FY22:$ 1.34 billion) and net proceeds from working capital loans of $123.4 million (FY22: $95.0 million). The increased volume of proceeds and repayments during the current year typically reflected a monthly rollover of the syndicated and bilateral loans that was implemented to reduce finance costs by taking greater advantage of the yield curve and lower margins available on shorter dated loans.

# SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the borrowing.

After initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised.

# Total Tools Group put options

Metcash has an  $85\%$  ownership interest in Total Tools Holdings Pty Ltd (Total Tools), which is the parent entity in the Total Tools Group, comprising the franchisor operations, 8 company-owned stores and ownership interests in 38 Total Tools independent retail stores (JV stores).

The remaining shareholders in Total Tools have the right to put their  $15 \%$ ownership interest to Metcash, via a put option, exercisable between 1 November 2023 and 31 January 2024. Metcash has the right to acquire the remaining  $15 \%$ equity interest via a call option, exercisable at any time from 1 November 2023. The exercise price of the put and call options are based on a multiple of the Total Tools Group EBITDA over the 12- month period ending on 29 October 2023, adjusted for a number of items, including net debt and working capital and was valued at $95.8 million at balance date.

In addition, Total Tools has ownership of between  $51\%$  and  $80\%$  in 38 Total Tools JV stores, including three greenfield JV stores established during FY23 and 8 JV stores acquired in FY23 from franchise owners (refer note 6.1). Accordingly, at balance date, Metcash holds an effective ownership interest of between  $43\%$  and  $68\%$  in these JV Stores.

The Total Tools JV Store put option agreements allow individual minority shareholders to sell their remaining equity interests in the 38 JV Stores to Total Tools. Metcash has the right to acquire the remaining equity interests via call options, generally exercisable at any time. The exercise price of the put options are based on a multiple of the respective store's EBITDA over a 12-month period immediately prior to the respective exercise dates, adjusted for a number of items, including net debt and working capital.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 APRIL 2023 CONTINUED

In accordance with AASB 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, the Group has recognised financial liabilities for the Total Tools put option and the JV Store put options, has derecognised the non-controlling interests in Total Tools and the JV Stores and has ceased accounting for the non-controlling interests. Accordingly, the Statement of Comprehensive Income includes  $100\%$  of the net profit of Total Tools and includes  $100\%$  of the net profits of the JV Stores.

The above put option liabilities are remeasured at each reporting date at the estimated put option exercise price, with any change in value recorded as a significant item within the Statement of Comprehensive Income, together with the net present value interest unwind on the put option liability.

At balance date, the carrying amount of the Total Tools Group put option liabilities is  $268.6 million (FY22:$ 210.6 million). Refer note 3.3 of the financial report for details in relation to the put option valuation adjustments recognised during the period.

# Other put options

The Group has also recognised a liability of  $13.6 million (FY22:$ 21.1 million) in respect of an additional three put options written over non-controlling interests in non-wholly owned subsidiaries within the Hardware pillar. These put option arrangements allow minority shareholders to sell their equity interests to Metcash, subject to specific terms and conditions. These put options are measured at the present value of the redemption amount under the option.

# SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Arrangements within certain business combinations entitle the non-controlling interests to require the Group to acquire their shareholding via exercise of a put option, subject to specific terms and conditions. Where such an arrangement is deemed to be part of the business combination, a financial liability is recognised on the acquisition date measured at the present value of the redemption amount under the arrangement. The initial recognition of the put option liability is charged directly to retained earnings and the non-controlling interest is derecognised.

The put option liability is subsequently remeasured at each reporting date at the estimated put option exercise price, with any change in value recorded within the Statement of Comprehensive Income, together with the net present value interest unwind on the put option liability.

# SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE

The valuations used to determine the carrying amount of put option liabilities are based on forward looking key assumptions that are, by nature, uncertain. This requires an estimation of future earnings and cash flows which includes assumptions in relation to sales volume growth, cost of sales and costs of doing business.

# Contingent put option liabilities

# Ritchies Stores Pty Ltd (Ritchies) put option

The Group has a put option with Ritchies Stores Pty Ltd (Ritchies). Metcash has a  $29.9\%$  (FY22:  $28.9\%$ ) ownership interest in Ritchies, which is recognised as an equity-accounted investment on the Group's balance sheet. The remaining shareholders in Ritchies have the right to put their  $70.1\%$  (FY22:  $71.1\%$ ) ownership interests to Metcash, via a put option, subject to a margin related annual financial hurdle ('hurdle') being achieved.

The put option can be exercised collectively by all shareholders during a prescribed period following the approval of Ritchies' annual audited financial report ('group put option' representing the remaining  $70.1\%$  shareholding) or in certain circumstances by individual minority shareholders within a prescribed period ('small shareholder put option').

Should the hurdle be achieved, and the shareholders elect to exercise any put option, the purchase consideration payable by Metcash is based on a multiple of the prior year reported earnings, normalised for certain adjustments.

Whilst the financial hurdle was achieved in respect of Ritches' 2022 financial year, the group put option was not exercised in relation to that year. Metcash estimates that the group put option consideration payable to Ritches shareholders in respect of the 2022 financial year would have been between $345 million and $355 million.

During FY23, a small shareholder holding an aggregate of 5,600 shares (or  $1.0\%$  stake in Ritchies) exercised their option under the 'small shareholder put option' in relation to Ritchies' 2022 financial year, bringing Metcash's share in Ritchies to  $29.9\%$ .

If any put options were to be exercised in future years, the exercise price will be determined with reference to Ritchies' results for that financial year and the consideration payable would reflect those results.

The put option agreement terminates when Metcash ceases to hold shares in Ritchies or if Ritchies lists on the ASX.

The Ritchies put option is recognised at a fair value of nil.

# Share-based payments reserve

The share-based payments reserve is used to record the value of equity benefits provided to executives as part of their remuneration. Once a performance right has lapsed the Group no longer has any obligation to convert these performance rights into share capital. The amount transferred to retained earnings represents the value of share-based payments previously recognised as an expense that have subsequently lapsed.

# Foreign currency translation reserve

The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries.

# Cash flow hedge reserve

The cash flow hedge reserve records the portion of the unrealised gain or loss on a hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge that is determined to be an effective hedge.

# 5.6 Financial risk management

# Objectives and policies

The Group's principal financial instruments comprise bank loans and overdrafts, leases, cash and short-term deposits and derivatives. The main purpose of these instruments is to finance the Group's operations. The Group also has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and payables, which arise directly from its operations.

The main risks arising from the Group's financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign exchange risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are detailed below. The objective of the Group's risk management policy is to support delivery of the Group's financial targets while protecting future financial security.

# Liquidity risk and funding management

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its payment obligations when they fall due under normal and extreme circumstances. To limit this risk, the Group manages assets with liquidity in mind, and monitors future cash flows and liquidity on a daily basis. The Group's primary sources of debt funding are syndicated, bilateral and working capital facilities, of which  $40.6\%$  (FY22:  $33.6\%$ ) has been utilised as at 30 April 2023. The Group monitors forecasts of liquidity reserves on the basis of expected cash flow.

# Available credit facilities

# Syndicated facilities

Syndicated bank loans are senior unsecured revolving facilities. The facilities are due to expire in September 2025 ( $100.0 million), May 2026 ($ 200.0 million), May 2027 ( $300.0 million) and May 2028 ($ 125.0 million). Interest is payable on the facilities based on BBSY plus a margin. The applicable margin is dependent upon an escalation matrix linked to the Senior Leverage Ratio achieved. These bank loans are subject to certain financial undertakings as detailed in note 5.2.

During the year, as part of refinancing the Group's syndicated facilities, $525.0 million of Sustainable Finance facilities were established, with an average tenure of 4.5 years. The establishment of the facility is aligned with Metcash's sustainability targets and includes three key performance indicators (KPIs) centred around emissions reduction, general waste to landfill reduction and mental health first aid accreditations.

# Working capital

Working capital bank loans are represented by four unsecured revolving facilities totalling \(250.0 million. These facilities mature in July 2023 (\)120.0 million), September 2023 (\(25.0 million), November 2023 (\)30.0 million) and February 2024 (\(75.0 million). Interest payable on any loans drawn under these facilities is based on BBSY or the RBA cash rate plus a margin. These bank loans are subject to certain financial undertakings as detailed in note 5.2.

# Bilateral loans

Bilateral bank loans are represented by three unsecured revolving facilities totalling  $125.0 million. These facilities mature in June 2024 ($ 25.0 million), June 2025 ( $50.0 million) and December 2028 ($ 50.0 million). Interest payable on any loans drawn under these facilities is based on BBSY plus a margin. These bank loans are subject to certain financial undertakings as detailed in note 5.2.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 APRIL 2023 CONTINUED

# Interest rate risk

The Group's exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group's bank debt obligations with a floating interest rate.

Metcash manages this risk by entering into interest rate swap contracts with various major Australian banks. At 30 April 2023, the principal hedged was $150.0 million (FY22: nil) with a weighted average hedge maturity of 1.2 years (FY22: nil) and a weighted average fixed interest rate of  $3.7\%$  (FY22: nil). The Group considered these derivatives to be effective hedges in accordance with AASB 9 Financial Instruments and therefore treats them as cash flow hedges. These interest rate swaps are exposed to fair value movements based on changes to the interest rate curve.

The Group's treasury policy provides percentage ranges across yearly periods for the interest rate hedging of net debt. Core debt is defined as the minimum level of drawn debt which is expected to occur over the year. At 30 April 2023, Metcash has $443.3 million (FY22: $296.5 million) bank debt obligations.

At the reporting date, the Group had the following mix of financial assets and liabilities exposed to Australian variable interest rate risk that, except as indicated, are not designated in cash flow hedges:

<table><tr><td></td><td>FY23
$m</td><td>FY22
$m</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">FINANCIAL ASSETS</td></tr><tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents</td><td>89.5</td><td>104.7</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">FINANCIAL LIABILITIES</td></tr><tr><td>Bank loans – syndicated</td><td>(200.0)</td><td>(200.0)</td></tr><tr><td>Bank loans – working capital</td><td>(168.3)</td><td>(45.0)</td></tr><tr><td>Bank loans – bilateral</td><td>(75.0)</td><td>(51.5)</td></tr><tr><td>Less: Interest rate swaps notional principal value – designated as cash flow hedges</td><td>150.0</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Net exposure</td><td>(203.8)</td><td>(191.8)</td></tr></table>

# Sensitivity analysis

Based on the Group's net debt position, after the impact of hedging as at 30 April 2023 and 2022, with all variables held constant, an  $0.5\%$  change in interest rates is estimated to result in a \ $0.7 million (FY22: \$ 0.7 million) change in the Group's net profit after tax. This sensitivity estimate is driven by higher/ lower interest costs from variable rate cash and bank debt, net of interest rate derivatives that hedge core debt.

These movements have been selected as they are considered reasonable, given the current economic climate and the current levels of short term and long-term Australian interest rates.

# Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments.

# Trade receivables and loans

The Group trades with a large number of customers and it is Group policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. In addition, where a loan has been provided, the Group will obtain security over certain assets of the customer wherever possible.

Receivables and loans are monitored on an ongoing basis and a formal review of all balances occurs every six months to measure impairment losses. As identified in note 4.1, the current level of impairment provision represents  $2.9\%$  (FY22:  $3.3\%$ ) of the Group's receivables and loans.

# Lease receivables

The Group is exposed to credit risk on 'back-to-back' arrangements contained within its property leases where Metcash has subleased properties to retailers. The Group regularly reviews material lease arrangements on an ongoing basis and a formal review of all leases occurs every six months to measure impairment losses. Refer note 4.2 for further details.

# Others

There are no other significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.

# Foreign exchange risk

The Group is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations on transactions and balances in respect of its operations in New Zealand.

This operation represents less than  $5\%$  of the Group's total sales revenue and total profit after tax.

In addition, the Group undertakes some foreign currency transactions when purchasing goods and services. The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the risk associated with anticipated purchase commitments denominated in foreign currencies.

The amount of foreign exchange cover is based on anticipated future purchases in light of current conditions in foreign markets, commitments from customers and experience.

# SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date at which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to fair value.

The fair value of derivative contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments. Derivatives are carried as assets when their fair value is positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative. Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives, except for those that qualify as cash flow hedges, are taken directly to the Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year.

Instruments that meet the strict criteria for hedge accounting are classified as:

- fair value hedges, when they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability; or  
- cash flow hedges, when they hedge the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable either to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or to a forecast transaction.

# Fair value hedges

The change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk hedged is recorded as part of the carrying value of the hedged item and is also recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as finance costs. If the hedged item is derecognised, the unamortised fair value is recognised immediately in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

When an unrecognised firm commitment is designated as a hedged item, the subsequent cumulative change in the fair value of the firm commitment attributable to the hedged risk is recognised as an asset or liability with a corresponding gain or loss recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

# Cash flow hedges

The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income and carried forward to the cash flow hedge reserve, while any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as finance costs.

Amounts recognised as other comprehensive income are transferred to profit or loss when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when the hedged financial income or financial expense is recognised or when a forecast sale occurs. When the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the amounts recognised as other comprehensive income are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.

If the forecast transaction or firm commitment is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is transferred to the Statement of Comprehensive Income. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, any cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income remains in other comprehensive income until the forecast transaction or firm commitment affects the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

# Current versus non-current classification

Derivative instruments are classified as current or non-current or separated into current and non-current portions based on an assessment of the facts and circumstances including the underlying contracted cash flows.

# 5.7 Capital management

For the purpose of the Group's capital management, capital includes all accounts classified as equity on the Statement of Financial Position. The Board's intention is to continue to invest in the business for future growth while maintaining a strong financial position and otherwise to assess returning surplus capital to shareholders.

On 26 June 2023, the Board determined to pay a fully franked FY23 final dividend of 11.0 cents per share. The FY23 final dividend represents a full year dividend payout ratio of  $70.6\%$  of underlying profit after tax.

The Board and management set out to maintain appropriate Statement of Financial Position ratios. Certain Statement of Financial Position ratios are also imposed under the Group's banking facilities (refer to note 5.2).

Management monitor capital through the debt leverage ratio (net debt / underlying EBITDA - depreciation of ROU assets). The FY23 debt leverage ratio was 0.62x, which reflects a low gearing position.

No changes were made to the overall objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during the year.

# 6. GROUP STRUCTURE

# 6.1 Business combinations and acquisition of additional interest in associate

# Acquisition of subsidiaries

# Total Tools 'JV stores'

The Total Tools acquisition has been very successful, with the business continuing to grow strongly since the acquisition of our  $70 \%$ majority stake in FY21 and a further  $15 \%$ ownership interest in FY22. It is a complementary business to our Hardware pillar, targeting tradespeople that use professional tools for a living with an unrivalled range of the best professional brands in the world, together with professional service solutions and advice. During the year, the Total Tools store footprint has continued to expand with a further acquisition of ownership interests of between  $51 \%$ and  $60 \%$ in eight Total Tools independent retail stores, together with the establishment of three greenfield JV stores. Accordingly, Metcash holds an effective ownership interest of between  $43 \%$ and  $51 \%$ in these ‘JV Stores’. While the Group has beneficial ownership of less than  $50 \%$ in some of these entities, the Group has control over key operating and financial decisions in these entities. Accordingly, these entities are accounted for as controlled entities.

Details of the purchase consideration and the provisional fair values of the net assets acquired at the date of acquisition are as follows:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Total Tools 
JV Stores 
$m</td></tr><tr><td>Net assets acquired</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents</td><td>2.4</td></tr><tr><td>Trade and other receivables</td><td>5.3</td></tr><tr><td>Inventories</td><td>18.0</td></tr><tr><td>Trade payables and provisions</td><td>(10.3)</td></tr><tr><td>Property, plant and equipment</td><td>1.7</td></tr><tr><td>Other assets – net</td><td>0.2</td></tr><tr><td>Net identifiable assets acquired (a)</td><td>17.3</td></tr><tr><td>Non-controlling interest</td><td>(7.6)</td></tr><tr><td>Goodwill</td><td>22.0</td></tr><tr><td>Total purchase consideration</td><td>31.7</td></tr></table>

(a) Net identifiable assets acquired include \(15.2 million of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.

From their respective dates of acquisition, the Total Tools JV stores contributed  $44.6 million of incremental sales revenue and$ 5.3 million of incremental earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to the Metcash Group, with 4 of the 8 JV stores having been acquired during March and April 2023.

# Put and call options written over non-controlling interests

In accordance with the AASB 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, the Group has recognised financial liabilities for the Total Tools JV Store put options at their provisional fair values totalling  $47.1 million and has derecognised the non-controlling interests of$ 9.1 million related to the acquisitions and the new greenfield JV stores. Details of these put options are set out in note 5.3 of the financial report. As at the date of acquisition, the net amount of $38.0 million has been recognised as an adjustment to retained earnings as shown below:

<table><tr><td></td><td>$m</td></tr><tr><td>Non-controlling interests derecognised1</td><td>9.1</td></tr><tr><td>Adjustment recognised directly in equity (retained earnings)</td><td>38.0</td></tr><tr><td>Fair value of put options recognised as a financial liability</td><td>47.1</td></tr></table>

(a) Non-controlling interests derecognised of  $9.1 million include$ 7.6 million in relation to the eight JV stores acquired and $1.5 million in relation to the three greenfield stores established in FY23.

Any changes in the value of the put option financial liabilities that occur subsequent to initial recognition will be recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and will be disclosed within significant items. Refer note 3.3 for further details.

<table><tr><td></td><td>$m</td></tr><tr><td>Cash consideration</td><td>31.7</td></tr><tr><td>Less: Cash and cash equivalents acquired</td><td>(2.4)</td></tr><tr><td>Net cash outflow – investing activities</td><td>29.3</td></tr></table>

Transaction costs incurred in relation to the acquisition of the above eight Total Tools JV stores of $1.5 million are included in significant items in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and in operating cash flows in the Statement of Cash Flows.

# Other business combinations

During the year, the Group also entered into a number of other business combinations within the Hardware pillar (7 businesses) and Liquor pillar (1 business) that were not material to the Group, individually. The total cash purchase price consideration paid for these businesses was  $26.6 million (net of cash acquired) and$ 2.4 million has been recognised as a liability in relation to deferred purchase consideration. The provisional fair values of net assets acquired included $20.6 million of goodwill, $6.5 million of inventory and $1.9 million of other assets (net).

From their respective dates of acquisition, these businesses contributed $25.6 million of incremental sales revenue to the Metcash Group.

The accounting for the above business combinations is provisional as at 30 April 2023.

# SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

# Business combinations

The acquisition of controlled entities is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method of accounting involves allocating the costs of the business combination to the acquisition date fair value of net assets acquired, including intangible assets, contingent liabilities and contingent consideration.

# Acquisition of additional interest in associate

During the year, the Group acquired an additional  $1.025\%$  interest in the voting shares in Ritchies from a small shareholder, increasing its ownership interest to  $29.9\%$  for a cash consideration of $4.5 million. Refer note 5.3 for further details.

# Measurement of fair values

# FY23 at-risk STI plan - deferred component

The  $33\%$  (Group CEO) and  $25\%$  (other KMP and senior executives) components of the FY23 at-risk STI plan will be deferred and released through the issue of Metcash performance rights conditional upon the executive remaining employed by the Company until 15 April 2024. The number of performance rights will be calculated by dividing  $33\%$  (Group CEO) and  $25\%$  (other KMP and senior executives) of the STI award dollar value by the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of Metcash ordinary shares over the 20 trading days ended 30 April 2023 of  $\$ 3.94$  per share. The FY23 expense for the FY23 at-risk STI plan – deferred component has been based on an estimate of the fair value of the performance rights. The fair value per grant will be determined in accordance with AASB 2 Share-based payments at grant date.

# FY22 at-risk STI plan - deferred component

The 33% (Group CEO) and 25% (other KMP and senior executives) components of the FY22 at-risk STI plan was deferred and released through the issue of Metcash performance rights conditional upon the executive remaining employed by the Company until 15 April 2023. The number of performance rights was calculated by dividing 33% (Group CEO) and 25% (other KMP and senior executives) of the STI award dollar value by the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of Metcash ordinary shares over the 20 trading days ended 30 April 2022 of $4.65 per share. The fair value per grant was determined in accordance with AASB 2 Share-based payments at grant date.

Service and non-market performance conditions attached to the grants were not taken into account in measuring fair value. Market performance conditions associated with the grants have been reflected in the fair value measurement. Expected volatility is based on an evaluation of the historical volatility of Metcash's share price, particularly over the historical period commensurate with the expected term. Performance rights are only exercisable on their vesting date.

# SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

# Share-based payment transactions

The Group provides a portion of senior executive and key employee remuneration as equity-settled share-based payments, in the form of performance rights.

The value of the performance rights issued is determined on the date which both the employee and the Group understand and agree to the share-based payment terms and conditions (grant date). The value at grant date is based upon the fair value of a similar arrangement between the Group and an independent third party and is determined using an appropriate valuation model. The fair value does not consider the impact of service or performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the share price of Metcash Limited (market conditions).

The fair value of performance rights is recognised as an expense, together with a corresponding increase in the share-based payments reserve within equity, over the period between the grant date and the date on which the employee becomes fully entitled to the award (vesting date). This expense is recognised cumulatively by estimating the number of performance rights expected to vest. This estimate is formed based on the best available information at the reporting date. No adjustment is made for the likelihood of market conditions being met as the effect of these conditions is included in the determination of fair value at grant date. Where the performance rights are cancelled, any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.

The dilutive effect, if any, of outstanding performance rights are reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share.

# Reconciliation of outstanding performance rights

The following table illustrates the movement in the number of performance rights during the year:

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 APRIL 2023 CONTINUED

# Key terms and conditions

All performance rights associated with the above schemes are equity-settled performance rights and were issued under the Metcash Executives and Senior Managers Performance Rights Plan (Rights Plan). Fully paid ordinary shares issued under this plan rank equally with all other existing fully paid ordinary shares in respect of voting and dividend rights.

The key terms of the 'LTI' and 'STI plan - deferred component' plans include:

1. Each performance right is an entitlement to receive a fully paid ordinary share in the Company on terms and conditions determined by the Board, including vesting conditions linked to service and performance over the contractual life of the rights;  
2. Performance rights which do not vest are forfeited;  
3. Performance rights are offered at no cost to participants;  
4. Performance rights do not carry voting or dividend rights, however shares allocated upon vesting of performance rights will carry the same rights as other ordinary shares;  
5. Ordinarily, in the event of cessation of employment, unvested performance rights will lapse; however, this is subject to Board discretion, which may be exercised in circumstances including death and disability, retirement, redundancy or special circumstances;  
6. When testing performance conditions, the Board has full discretion in relation to its calculation and to include or exclude items if appropriate, including to better reflect shareholder expectations or management performance;  
7. Some or all of a participant's performance rights may vest even if a performance condition has not been satisfied, if, using its discretion, the Board considers that to do so would be in the interests of the Group; and  
8. If there is a change in control of the Group, the Board retains full discretion to vest or lapse some or all performance rights.

The estimate of the maximum amount payable in respect of the guarantee, if exercised, is $40.0 million (FY22: $40.0 million).

Had the guarantee been exercised at 30 April 2023, the amount payable would have been  $25.2 million (FY22:$ 31.2 million). The fair value of the financial guarantee contract at the reporting date was  $0.9 million (FY22:$ 1.4 million) and is recognised as a financial liability.

Put options, including in relation to Ritchies Stores Pty Ltd, are detailed along with other contingent liabilities in note 5.3 of the financial statements.

# 7.4 Subsequent events

There were no events that have occurred after the end of the financial year that would materially affect the reported results or would require disclosure in this report.

# Independent auditor's report to the members of Metcash Limited

# Report on the audit of the financial report

# Opinion

We have audited the financial report of Metcash Limited (the Company) and its subsidiaries (collectively the Group), which comprises the consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 April 2023, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies, and the directors' declaration.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial report of the Group is in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, including:

a. Giving a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 30 April 2023 and of its consolidated financial performance for the year ended on that date; and  
b. Complying with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Regulations 2001.

# Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial report section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board's APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the Code) that are relevant to our audit of the financial report in Australia. We have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

# Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial report of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, but we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.

We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial report section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying financial report.

# Impairment assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets

# Why significant

At 30 April 2023, the Group's consolidated statement of financial position includes goodwill and other intangible assets with a carrying value  $895.1 million, representing 16.6% of total assets. The Group recognised$ 42.2 million in goodwill and other intangible assets arising from business acquisitions during the year.

The directors have assessed goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment. As disclosed within Note 4.7 to the financial statements, the assessment of the impairment of the Group's goodwill and other intangible assets incorporated significant judgments and estimates, based upon conditions existing as at 30 April 2023, specifically concerning factors such as forecast cashflows, discount rates and terminal growth rates.

The estimates and assumptions relate to the sustainability of future performance, market and economic conditions. Significant assumptions used in the impairment testing referred to above are inherently subjective.

The disclosures in the financial report provide important information about the assumptions made in the impairment testing and the market conditions at 30 April 2023.

Accordingly, we considered the impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets and the related disclosures in the financial report to be a key audit matter.

# 1. How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Our audit procedures included the following:

Assessed the Group's determination of the cash generating units (CGUs) used in the impairment model, based on our understanding of the nature of the Group's business and the economic environment in which the segments operate. We also considered internal reporting of the Group's results to assess how earnings and goodwill are monitored and reported.  
Assessed the Group's allocation of additional goodwill arising from business combinations to CGUs used in the impairment model.  
Assessed the cash flow forecasts, assumptions and estimates used by the Group, as outlined in Note 4.7 to the financial statements, by considering the reliability of the Group's historical cash flow forecasts, our knowledge of the business and corroborating data with external information where possible.  
Considered the impact on the cash flow forecasts related to the group's climate change commitments.  
Evaluated the appropriateness of discount and terminal growth rates applied with involvement from our valuation specialists.  
Tested the mathematical accuracy of the impairment testing models including the consistency of relevant data with latest Board approved forecasts.  
Performed sensitivity analysis on key assumptions including discount rates, terminal growth rates and EBIT forecasts for each of the Group's CGUs.  
Assessed the adequacy of the financial report disclosures contained in Note 4.7.

# Accounting for Rebates

# Why significant

Note 4.3 of the financial report outlines the Group's accounting policy relating to supplier rebates, or supplier income as they are referred to in the financial report.

The Group receives rebates and other similar incentives from suppliers which are determined based upon a number of measures which can include volumes of inventory purchased or sold and the performance of promotional activities.

We considered this to be a key audit matter as supplier rebates contributed significantly to the Group's results. There are a large number of specific agreements in place and some of the arrangements require judgment to be applied in determining the timing of rebate recognition and the appropriate classification within the financial statements, based upon the terms of the agreement.

# 2. How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Our audit procedures included the following:

Evaluated the Group's processes and design of controls relating to the recognition and valuation of rebate amounts recognised and classified within the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.  
Assessed the operating effectiveness of relevant controls in place relating to the recognition and measurement of purchase-volume based and non purchase-volume based rebates.  
Selected a sample of supplier rebates including non purchase-volume based rebates received and recorded as receivables at year-end and assessed whether the income was correctly calculated and recognised in the correct period.  
Considered the Group's assessment of the value of rebates associated with inventory on hand at year end that were deducted from the carrying value of inventory.  
Considered the impact of supplier claims during and subsequent to year end on amounts recognised.  
Inquired of the Group as to the existence of any non-standard agreements or side arrangements.

# Information other than the financial report and auditor's report thereon

The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Group's 2023 Annual Report other than the financial report and our auditor's report thereon. We obtained the directors' report that is to be included in the Annual Report, prior to the date of this auditor's report, and we expect to obtain the remaining sections of the Annual Report after the date of this auditor's report.

Our opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon, with the exception of the Remuneration Report and our related assurance opinion.

In connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial report or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed on the other information obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# EY

# Building a better working world

# Responsibilities of the directors for the financial report

The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters relating to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

# Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial report

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.

As part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

$\triangleright$  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.  
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.  
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.  
Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.  
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the disclosures, and whether the financial report represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.  
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

# EY

# Building a better working world

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

From the matters communicated to the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial report of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
