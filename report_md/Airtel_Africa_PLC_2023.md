# At a glance

# We operate in 14 dynamic, underpenetrated markets where strong demand drives our continued profitable growth.

An underpenetrated telecoms market, a young population and rising smartphone affordability, along with low data penetration, give us growth opportunities in both voice and data. The telecoms market in sub-Saharan Africa is projected to grow by  $4.5\%$  CAGR over the next five years. At the same time, low penetration of traditional banking services provides us with the opportunity to meet the needs of unbanked customers through our dedicated mobile money platform, Airtel Money.

Owing to significant growth in the Group's mobile money business and a corresponding change in the organisation's structure combined with changes in information provided to the chief operating decision-maker (CODM) for the allocation of resources and the assessment of performance, with effect from April 2022 the Group has identified mobile money as a new operating and reportable segment. Thus, the segments for the Group are:

Nigeria mobile services – comprising mobile service operations in Nigeria

East Africa mobile services – comprising mobile service operations in Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania, Malawi and Zambia

Francophone Africa mobile services – comprising mobile service operations in Niger, Gabon, Chad, Republic of the Congo, the DRC, Madagascar and the Seychelles

Mobile money – comprising mobile money services across the Group, including recently launched payment service bank in Nigeria

# Our voice, data and mobile money services are reaching more people than ever, and transforming customers' lives.

By extending our distribution network in both rural and semi-urban areas and providing resilient, far-reaching coverage, we've enabled millions of people to access telecoms and banking services. By leading the way in the rollout of 4G networks and enabling people to progress from 2G to 3G to 4G, we've helped drive digitalisation. Our expanding footprint of retailers, agents and exclusive franchises, supplemented by our unique operations, have helped deliver services across our markets. And we're helping build a new financial ecosystem that's full of opportunity. Our focus on increasing the number of mobile money use cases through international partnerships and product innovation has helped drive the take up of our mobile money services, boosting financial inclusion.

# Transforming lives

Providing essential services, and delivering on our purpose of transforming lives.

# Delivering sustainable growth, and demonstrating our resilience

This year has seen considerable volatility in the global economy, with recessionary pressures that have been keenly felt by people across the markets we serve. With prices of basic commodities on the increase, and instances of severe climate disruptions, reliable, affordable telecoms services that connect people to each other and to the wider economy are more vital than ever. Everyone at Airtel Africa is proud that we have been able to maintain and expand our services to our customers and communities throughout the year.

The fact that we have also been able to deliver a strong financial performance in this economic context is testament to the scale of the untapped demand in sub-Saharan Africa, and to the resilience of our business model. Powerful underlying macroeconomic and demographic trends continue to drive demand and adoption of voice, data and mobile money services, and our 'Win with' strategy continues to deliver growth: our customer base grew to 140 million people this year, and our revenues grew by  $11.5\%$  in reported currency.

This is not growth for its own sake. It is only by pursuing sustainable growth that we are able to fulfil our purpose of transforming lives: playing our part in addressing the challenges faced by millions of people who still lack access to data and financial services, and the wider transformation of economies that will drive sustainable development.

The fact that we have also been able to deliver a strong financial performance in this economic context is testament to the scale of the untapped demand in sub-Saharan Africa, and to the resilience of our business model.

# Playing our part in sustainable development

Publishing our first Sustainability Report in October 2022 was a seminal moment for Airtel Africa, furthering our commitment to corporate governance. It provides stakeholders with a transparent account of our progress in delivering the sustainability ambitions that underpin our business strategy, and our commitment to developing the infrastructure and services that will drive digital and financial inclusion for people across Africa while contributing to six of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). The Board closely oversees this strategy as part of our role in considering environmental, social and governance criteria in our decision-making.

Business has a crucial part to play in Africa's development. This year, as Chair of the newly launched B20 India Action Council on African Economic Integration: An Agenda for Global Business, I have seen positive signs of businesses coming together to work towards common goals and priorities.

Airtel Africa plays a significant role in supporting education, which has long been a priority for me and for everyone in the Group. We have set ourselves the goal of transforming the lives of over one million children on the continent through education by 2027, including through our landmark five-year partnership with UNICEF – which this year rolled out programmes in 6 of the 13 countries where the partnership is in place.

# Investing to create long-term value for all

Our underlying strategy remains unchanged in its fundamentals. We maintain a continuous focus on serving customers' needs so we can deliver sustainable, profitable growth, while mitigating our risks and maintaining our longstanding focus on strengthening our balance sheet. This year, for instance, we continued to localise our debt into our country-level OpCos while reducing HoldCo debt, helping to mitigate the risk of foreign exchange volatility. Our gross OpCo debt of  $3,676m (including lease liabilities) is now higher than our remaining HoldCo debt of$ 550m.

Pursuing sustainable growth enables us to fulfil our purpose of transforming lives: playing our part in addressing the challenges faced by millions of people who still lack access to connectivity, data and financial services. We are committed to contributing towards the wider transformation of economies to drive sustainable growth and development.

# 99

Leverage was at 1.4x in March 2023, broadly flat from the previous year. This was achieved alongside substantial investments: we invested  $748m in capex (excluding spectrum), and$ 500m in spectrum (including 5G) in key markets – ensuring we are ready to meet the continuing opportunity in data. Almost 87% of our capex investment in 2022/23 was directed to growth initiatives that help ensure a sustainably strong and reliable network.

We continue to strengthen the business in other ways. We have made compelling strides in building the standalone capabilities of our Airtel Money business across all markets and begun acting on the opportunity presented by the granting of our super-agent licence and Payment Service Bank (PSB) licence in Nigeria in April 2022. We have also established new holding and subsidiary company structures for our data and fibre businesses.

The Board of directors has recommended a final dividend of 3.27 cents per share, making the total dividend for 2022/23 5.45 cents per share, which is an increase of  $9\%$  in line with our progressive dividend policy.

# Stakeholders at the heart of transforming lives

Everything the business has achieved in this turbulent year is thanks to the support of all our stakeholders. In particular, our people have continued to show great dedication to ensuring the delivery of services and to serving our customers and the communities in which we live and work. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank them for their continuing commitment to transforming lives.

# CEO Q&A

Chief executive officer Olusegun Ogunsanya reflects on a year in which our robust business performance has helped drive our sustainability agenda – and on our opportunity to transform lives in Africa.

# Q. How will you look back at this year?

A. The joy of running this business – and the thing that I see motivating our people – is that we are part of the solution to the challenges around us.

There's no doubt this has been a difficult year for many in our communities. While sub-Saharan Africa is very resilient, it is not immune to global economic shocks. Sharp commodity and fuel inflation really hurts in communities where many people spend  $40\%$  of their income on food. Climate change has a disproportionate impact on Africans. Currency disruptions create serious challenges for businesses and individuals.

But as Airtel Africa people, we are part of our communities – we share their pain as well as their joy. And we can see the difference we're making. Every day, we're connecting customers to each other, to the digital future, and to economic opportunity. The more we serve, the more we succeed. By delivering our strategy and growing our business, we're part of the process of sustainable development. That's what we mean by transforming lives.

# Q. What were the highlights of your financial performance?

A. We've really demonstrated the resilience of our strategy and business model. The economic environment has generated considerable headwinds this year, but we have delivered significant growth in all our key metrics. Our revenues grew by  $11.5\%$  and operating profit by  $14.5\%$  in reported currency.

We have grown revenues in data by  $23.8\%$ , in voice services by  $11.8\%$  and in mobile money by  $29.6\%$  in constant currency. We've continued to provide essential services in all our markets throughout the year, and to serve more customers than ever before, reaching 140 million in total. Underlying EBITDA grew by  $17.3\%$  in constant currency at a stable EBITDA margin of  $49.0\%$  despite all the turbulences.

We know how important affordability is to customers in a cost-of-living crisis – and our philosophy has always been to drive usage, rather than price. Not only are we reaching more customers, but our customers are getting more for their money.

This performance has made us one of the fastest-growing telecoms company in sub-Saharan Africa. And it has come alongside important investment in our future – and in the future of our communities. We invested $748m in expanding and strengthening our network, so we can reach and include more people. We invested in our fibre infrastructure and data centres, where we see opportunities to form mutually beneficial partnerships with other businesses.

And as of 31 March 2023, we invested \(500m in spectrum (which includes 5G), so we can meet the demand for data now, and be ready for an even more digital future. The macroeconomic outlook remains volatile, but we are well positioned to deliver against the growth opportunities these markets offer, with a continued focus on margin resilience.

# Q. How has your 'Win with' strategy created competitive advantage?

A. Our 'Win with' strategy has six pillars – 'technology', 'distribution', 'data', 'mobile money', 'cost' and 'people' – all underpinned by our sustainability strategy.

It is the execution of the strategy that really counts – and I believe we can be proud of the execution of every pillar. I've already mentioned the expansion of our network, and how the talent and determination of our people has driven our success. The  $46.3\%$  increase in data usage demonstrates how that pillar is thriving – and the  $36\%$  increase in home broadband revenues shows what an opportunity there is in that segment.

'Win with cost' has been important this year, as we've had great success maintaining margins despite unprecedented inflation – our underlying EBITDA margin was  $49.0\%$ . We've also localised much of our debt as mitigation against foreign exchange risk, maintaining Group debt at 1.4x of underlying EBITDA while investing significantly in the future.

But some of the strongest examples of us executing the strategy and winning in the market have been in 'Win with distribution' and 'Win with mobile money'. Our distribution network gets us closer to our customers so they can access our services – and this year we increased the number of our customer activating outlets by  $21\%$  bringing the total number of 304,000+ outlets across our 14 markets. Airtel Money, meanwhile, has gone from strength to strength, with  $20.4\%$  more mobile money customers, and transaction value increasing by  $41.3\%$  in constant currency.

# Q. Why is the mobile money opportunity so important?

A. Mobile money is a clear example of an opportunity to benefit communities while driving business growth. Sub-Saharan Africa remains underserved by banks and financial services, excluding millions of people from the financial system, and disproportionately excluding women.

It is a competitive sector, where we need to keep building our ecosystem to stay ahead of new fintech offers, engage with Central Banks to meet growing regulatory requirements, and make sure we have the right IT capabilities. But we've made significant strides through Airtel Money this year, launching mobile money services in Nigeria through our new Payment Services Bank (PSB) licence granted in April 2022, rolling out micro merchant propositions in Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia, and introducing loan products in Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya and Zambia. And as our mobile money business has grown, we've invested in growing Airtel Money's organisational capabilities, skills and technology. This work is underpinned by our sustainability strategy, which sets targets for building our mobile money ecosystem and includes a specific target to reach 20 million women customers by 2025.

# Q. You published your first sustainability report in October 2022 – what were the highlights?

A. Airtel Africa has supported communities in areas including education, health and wellbeing, and disaster relief for decades – but we achieved a real step change in our approach to environment, social and governance (ESG) through our sustainability strategy, launched in 2021. This year we achieved another milestone with our Sustainability Report, which demonstrated progress against all our targets – but also highlighted how much there is still to do in order to achieve the sustainable development goals that we support.

One of the biggest elements of our work this year has been developing our pathway to net zero as we strive to limit the impact of our operations on the environment. Our detailed analysis across 14 OpCos has highlighted significant decarbonisation strategies we can implement to reduce our carbon emissions. We have set a target to reduce our scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity by more than  $60\%$  within ten years of our baseline and achieve net zero by 2050.

Our investment in network expansion, particularly in rural and semi-rural areas, is giving millions of people access to reliable and high-quality digital and financial services, often for the first time. We're making progress on building a diverse and inclusive workforce, where all our people can develop their careers and reach their full potential. And we continued to work on our landmark partnership with UNICEF, providing educational resources, free of charge, to more than 250,000 children this year on our way to reaching one million children by 2027.

Our partnership with UNICEF, for me, stands as a beacon for what our business is all about. Education is a vital engine for social mobility, social equality, and the elimination of poverty – alongside the services we provide, it will unlock opportunity in Africa, and transform lives.

# Our investment proposition

# Our operations in 14 sub-Saharan African countries offer substantial market potential across voice, data and mobile money services.

The countries we operate in have some of the youngest populations in the world, and are projected to grow fast, contributing to sustainable growth in our customer base. Combined with relatively low numbers of unique mobile customers, low minutes of usage, low data consumption and limited traditional banking services, this creates a huge opportunity for the continued growth of Airtel Africa.

Mobile Money

We have the diversity and scale to deliver affordable telecoms and mobile money services to our customers. Our accelerated investment into our asset base, strong brand recognition and effective distribution channels (both direct and indirect) give us sustainable differentiation in the market. We continue to deliver a strong track record of growth and improved operational performance. Our lean and simplified operating model, combined with our effective management team, has delivered double-digit revenue growth, strong profitability and cash flow despite inflationary pressures across many of our markets.

# Our key performance indicators

# Our KPIs give our Board and management a clear sense of where we are and where we need to improve.

# Measuring the success of our strategy

We monitor the success of our strategy through operational, financial and non-financial key performance indicators (KPIs). These KPIs give us a crucial insight into our business performance and the progress being made towards our strategic intent.

Our selected KPIs help us to communicate the Group's strategy across all levels of the organisation, and form part of our governance and performance management process.

# Ensuring our KPIs are meaningful and responsive

We monitor our strategic progress through primary operational KPIs which include sites, data capacity, customer base, net additions, average revenue per user (ARPU), usage per customer and Airtel Money transactions.

Our key financial KPIs are revenue, underlying EBITDA, operating profit, profit after tax, operating free cash flow, net cash generated from operating activities, leverage, basic earnings per share, and return on capital employed.

Further, our non-financial performance KPIs linked to our sustainability strategy are scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions, energy consumption, population covered and gender diversity.

We review our operational, financial and non-financial KPIs regularly to ensure that they are aligned with our strategy and organisational goals.

For more information about our sustainability KPIs, see page 38  
See definition and reconciliation of our alternative performance measures on pages 87-88

# Linkage with remuneration

We review our remuneration-linked KPIs every year to ensure these are relevant to our business strategy. Our remuneration targets are linked with selected financial and non-financial KPIs. As part of our long-term incentive scheme, we also benchmark our total shareholder return performance with a peer group of companies.

# Our market environment

# High demand across sub-Saharan Africa

There is a clear runway for growth in sub-Saharan Africa, where a young and growing population demand data, mobile voice, and mobile money services to connect with each other, do business, and unlock economic opportunity.

People across our markets are 'mobile first', with mobile services the first and often only way they have to access telecoms, internet and banking services. And among a population of more than 1 billion people in sub-Saharan Africa, half of whom will be under 25 years old by  $2050^{*}$ , there is huge scope to increase the reach and penetration of effective voice, data and mobile money services, and to include more people in the digital economy. The need for accessible, affordable services has never been greater – as demand continued to rise in 2022 despite economic turbulence and inflationary shocks across the region.

# Mobile services: often the only way to connect

Millions of people in our markets lack access to landline infrastructure, and broadband penetration levels are far lower than in much of the world. Mobile networks continue to be the primary source of voice and data services for the vast majority of sub-Saharan Africans – which means that our focus on expanding our networks and extending rural coverage plays a vital role in including people in the mobile and digital economy. In 2022/23, we invested $700m in capital expenditure, predominantly in our networks, and there is a great opportunity to expand coverage further. Mobile connectivity in our markets is still low relative to other regions – though people's appetite for connection means it is growing fast. By the end of 2021, 515 million people subscribed to mobile services in sub-Saharan Africa, representing 46% of the population – almost 20 million more than in 2020. It is projected that there will be nearly 100 million new subscribers by 2025, taking the total number of subscribers to 613 million (50% of the region's population)(i).

Accessibility will continue to underpin this growth: we added 2,700+ sites to our network in the past year and grew our customer base by  $9.0\%$ .

# Harnessing digitalisation as the engine of growth

Africa's future economic growth will be driven by digitalisation – which places it high on the agenda of many governments in our markets. Businesses and service providers need reliable, competitively priced data in order to flourish and generate economic value. Mobile technology enables digital solutions and supports the growing use

of online channels by consumers, while effective broadband can help businesses thrive.

The GSMA estimated that in 2022,  $40\%$  of the adult population in sub-Saharan Africa was connected to mobile internet services – a rapid increase since 2001, when the figure was  $1\%$ , but there is clear evidence that expansion still has far to go. The same report showed there is also a usage gap:  $44\%$  of adults live in areas covered by mobile broadband networks but do not yet use mobile internet services.

Smartphone adoption in our markets remains relatively low, at around  $36.3\%$ , although it improved by  $2.1\%$  in 2022/23. 4G coverage is also expanding – our own 4G network now reaches  $65.9\%$  of the population in our footprint, an annual increase of  $3.3\%$ . And in the future, there will be a clear role for 5G – which is why we continued to invest in 5G spectrum this year.

Our strategic focus on winning with data, supported by our expanding digital products and content, Airtel TV, and our focus on supporting enterprises, places us at the forefront of this digital opportunity – which will transform lives while driving business growth.

# Mobile money – driving financial inclusion

More people than ever now enjoy access to formal financial services, thanks to the growth of digital financial services in sub-Saharan Africa. Africa as a whole, which has historically been underserved by formal banking, is now home to almost half of digital financial services users worldwide. And financial services are critical to wider economic development and opportunity: financial inclusion is an enabler for seven of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs).

Africa's domestic e-payments market is expected to see revenues grow by approximately  $20\%$  per year, reaching around $40 billion by 2025, according to a 2022 McKinsey Report**.

Airtel Money is well-placed to be part of this opportunity. We continue to build the mobile money ecosystems that help customers join the digital economy, and to win new customers through services, including interoperability, payments, micro-loans and international money transfers.

# Affordability critical amidst cost-of-living pressures

Global economic turbulence has had an impact on many of our markets over the past year, with prices for food and fuel rising rapidly, exacerbated in some markets by supply chain disruptions and foreign exchange fluctuations. Consumers have felt these inflationary pressures keenly – and while demand for telecoms services continues to rise, affordability remains very important. We offer pricing plans that are simple and transparent, based on the principle of 'more for more' – meaning that the cost of connecting has fallen in real terms.

The competitive landscape continues to be dominated by a few large competitors, with some smaller regional companies in some markets.

So alongside price, we compete for customers through our range of services, our advertising and brand image, the quality and reliability of our service, and our wide coverage. Our focus on distribution is designed to give us competitive advantage in recruiting and winning new customers.

The overall economic picture in our markets is of subdued current growth – but huge potential for the future. Real GDP in sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to have grown by  $3.6\%$  in 2022, reflecting a slowdown from  $4.7\%$  in 2021, and is forecast to remain at around  $3.7\%$  in 2023.[1] Over the next three decades, however, the population is set to nearly double, to around 2 billion, with  $32.2\%$  of the population in our markets between the ages of 10 and 24 years, and GDP is expected to grow at around  $7\%$ .

For more information about our 'Win with' strategy, see pages 26-37

# Managing risk, and contributing to sustainable development

As in any business sector, telecoms in sub-Saharan Africa operates against a background of risks and challenges, as well as opportunities.

Among these risks, currency devaluation and, in some cases this year, shortages of foreign currency in local markets need to be carefully managed and mitigated – this is addressed as a principal risk in our risk management framework, which covers a range of strategic, financial, operational, governance and compliance risks.

Africa is also disproportionately affected by climate change, which presents a real risk to economies and communities. Our sustainability strategy is designed to ensure we make a meaningful contribution to the societies and economies where we live and work. We have been working closely with The Carbon Trust over the last six months, to develop a detailed pathway for the reduction of our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We have completed a detailed audit of our assets and have identified specific programmes and initiatives to significantly reduce our scope 1 and 2 emissions. These initiatives have been analysed across our footprint by a cross-functional taskforce which has been established to oversee the project. This taskforce updates the Sustainability Committee regularly.

For more information, see how we manage our risk on pages 90-97  
For information about our sustainability strategy, see pages 38-55

# Operating in a highly regulated sector

All telecommunication operators must work within the frameworks created by governments and regulatory authorities, covering telecoms regulations, banking regulations and licences. Alongside strict compliance with regulations, we aim to work collaboratively with governments to make sure we integrate our services into their key initiatives and play our part in strengthening economies and transforming lives.

In many markets, Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations apply – these require customers to register their identity to access mobile services. Providing easy access to a fast and compliant registration process is a key part of our 'Win with' distribution approach. Data security is another concern for regulators and consumers – and as part of our sustainability strategy, we operate under the 'Information Security Management System' (ISO 27001) certification and the 'Business Continuity Management System' (ISO 22301) certification, which cover all mobile communication and mobile money operations.

# Legal and regulatory frameworks

We operate within the laws and regulatory frameworks of governments and regulatory agencies to bridge the digital divide and expand financial inclusion in our markets – and we always work to ensure that our operations meet local legal and regulatory requirements.

We engage with governments and regulatory authorities to promote a stable business environment that supports governments' goals for the sector alongside the long-term viability of our business.

The legal and regulatory frameworks we work within fall into three categories: telecoms services, mobile financial services and broadcasting services. In some of our markets, there are also competition laws.

We keep the regulatory framework under continuous review, and publish significant developments on our corporate website, under 'Regulatory news'. Here we describe the most significant developments in our largest markets this year.

# Tax developments

In 2022/23 several governments reviewed their tax arrangements:

# Democratic Republic of the Congo - tax on telecommunication services

In March 2022, the DRC government introduced a new telecoms tax on usage. In October 2022, the provisions of the telecoms tax were suspended and the government agreed to introduce a fixed tax based on each operator's market share. This resulted in reduced cost for operators.

# Gabon - Finance Act 2023

In February 2023, the Finance Act 2023 introduced a tax on mobile money at the rate of  $0.5\%$  of the revenues collected by mobile operators.

Kenya - tax on handsets and imported SIM cards In July 2022, the new Finance Act re-introduced  $10\%$  excise duty on importation of handsets and a KES 50 duty per unit on imported ready-to-use SIM cards. This will impact the cost of handset devices and the cost of services.

# Niger - Finance Law 2022

In December 2022, the Government of Niger introduced a stamp duty of  $2\%$  of the value of the invoice of each contract that mobile operators enter with suppliers. This tax increases the overall cost of doing business in Niger. The finance law also abolished the tax on incoming international traffic, thus lowering the cost of incoming calls.

# Tanzania - Finance Act 2022

The Finance Act 2022 introduced amendments that resulted in reduction of levies on electronic mobile money transfers and withdrawals. This reduction has benefited customers and resulted in increased uptake of the services.

# Zambia - Finance Act 2023

In January 2023, the Finance Act 2023 abolished the two-tier taxation system that existed in Zambia where corporations in the telecommunication sector paid corporate tax at the rate of  $40\%$ , with all other corporations paying  $35\%$ . This law harmonised corporate tax across all sectors of the economy at the rate of  $35\%$ . The Act also reduced customs duty to  $0\%$  and  $5\%$  from  $15\%$  and  $25\%$ , respectively, for a period of three years, on selected information and communications technology (ICT) and telecommunications equipment to encourage uptake.

# Financial services licences

Republic of the Congo – electronic money issuer licence

On 19 December 2022, Airtel Mobile Commerce Congo S.A. was issued with the final licence to operate as an electronic money issuer in the Republic of the Congo.

Gabon – electronic money issuer licence

On 17 October 2022, Airtel Money S.A. (Gabon) was issued with the final licence to operate as an electronic money issuer in Gabon.

Niger - electronic money issuer licence

In July 2022 BCEAO (Central Bank of West African States) licensed Airtel Money Niger SA. to operate as an electronic money issuer in Niger.

Nigeria – Payment Service Bank (PSB) Licence

On 27 April 2022, the Central Bank of Nigeria issued SmartCash PSB Limited with final approval to operate as a Payment Service Bank (PSB) in Nigeria.

# Spectrum acquisitions

# Democratic Republic of the Congo

In May 2022, Airtel DRC S.A. acquired 58 MHz of additional spectrum spread across 900, 1800, 2100 and 2600 MHz bands, for a gross consideration of \(42m from Yozma, through a process that involved the surrender of the licences by Yozma to the government, and the direct acquisition of the spectrum by Airtel DRC S.A. which was confirmed by the modification of the Airtel licences by the State to incorporate the new spectrum. The licence for 10 MHz of paired spectrum in the 2100 MHz band will come up for renewal in September 2032. All the other licences will continue until July 2036.

# Kenya

In July 2022, Airtel Networks Kenya Limited acquired 60 MHz in the 2600 MHz spectrum band for a period of 15 years upon payment of $40m.

# Nigeria

On 6 December 2022, the regulator confirmed that Airtel Networks Nigeria Limited (Airtel Nigeria) had emerged as the sole bidder in the 3.5 GHz spectrum auction. Airtel Nigeria was awarded one lot in the 3.5 GHz spectrum auction at a price of $285m for a period of ten years from 1 March 2023.

On 8 December 2022, the regulator awarded Airtel Nigeria two slots of 5 MHz each in the 2.6 GHz band for a period of ten years at a price of $32m.

On 13 March 2023, the Nigeria Communications Commission (NCC) offered Airtel Nigeria the opportunity to renew its 2100 MHz spectrum licence at a price of N58,659,955,200.00 (equivalent of $150m) for a period of 15 years. Airtel Nigeria has accepted the offer.

# Tanzania

In October 2022, Airtel Tanzania was awarded 80 MHz in the 3500 MHz band and two blocks of 15 MHz in the 2600 MHz band at the price of  $21m and$ 39m, respectively. The spectrum was issued for a period of 15 years from the date of award.

# Zambia

800 MHz and 2600 MHz band: on 14 July 2022, the regulator awarded Airtel Zambia two blocks of 10 MHz in the 800 MHz band at the price of  $17m and one block of 50 MHz in the 2600 MHz band at the price of$ 12m.

2.6 GHz spectrum: on 15 November 2022, Airtel Zambia was awarded a further 40 MHz in the 2600 MHz band at the price of $12m. The spectrum assigned to Airtel Zambia is renewable annually at no additional cost for the duration of operating licences until 2028.

# Licence modification in Rwanda

In 2022 the Government of Rwanda released their revised broadband policy. This required the full liberalisation of the telecommunications sector and proposed to move away from technology-specific (2G, 3G, 4G) licences and services to technology-neutral licences and services. It also removed the restriction that previously existed in respect of access to spectrum, which is typically used for 4G, 5G and future technologies. It also involved the removal of the restriction in respect of direct provision of services that fall within these categories of technology.

In January 2023, the regulator commenced the process of modifying existing telecommunication licences to conform the telecom licences to the requirements of the revised broadband policy. Under the modified licence, Airtel Rwanda will be able to access spectrum for 4G, 5G and future technologies and offer 4G services using existing spectrum without restriction.

# Submarine cable licences

# Republic of the Congo

In June 2022, the regulator issued Airtel Congo S.A. with a submarine cable licence for a period of ten years in preparation of the landing of the 2Africa submarine cable in the Republic of the Congo.

# Tanzania

In August 2022, the regulator issued Airtel Tanzania plc with an addendum to its national and international network facilities and network services licences to extend their scope to allow for the landing and operating of the 2Africa submarine cable systems in Tanzania.

# Uganda listing

Under Airtel Uganda's National Telecom Operator (NTO) licence, Airtel Uganda Limited (Airtel Uganda) is obliged to comply with the sector policy, regulations and guidelines requiring the listing of part of its shares on the Uganda Stock Exchange (USE). The current Uganda Communications (Fees and Fines) (Amendment) Regulations 2020, creates a public listing obligation for all NTO licensees, and specifies that  $20\%$  of the shares of the operator must be listed within two years of the effective date of the licence. This imposed a listing requirement by 15 December 2022 on Airtel Uganda.

On 17 June 2022, the Uganda Communications Commission issued Airtel Uganda an extension of the listing obligation from 15 December 2022 to 16 December 2023 on condition that the prospectus is submitted to the capital markets authority for approval before 30 June 2023. Airtel Uganda is working towards the listing with advisors and is confident it will meet the required deadline.

# Our 'Win with' strategy

Our 'Win with' strategy is designed to deliver long-term value for all our stakeholders, and is underpinned by the detailed framework of environmental, social and governance (ESG) objectives in our sustainability strategy.

We're transforming lives across sub-Saharan Africa through products, services and programmes that foster financial inclusion, drive digitalisation and empower our 140 million customers and their communities. We have a clear business objective: to grow market share profitably and create superior enterprise value while delivering our sustainability strategy, so we can continue to serve our vision of enriching the lives of our customers.

Our 'Win with' strategy has six strategic pillars through which we aim to deliver sustainable, profitable growth. Underpinning all these pillars are two constant themes: digitalisation, and our commitment to contributing to sustainable development through our sustainability strategy.

We aim to act as a responsible business at all times – and to deliver on our promises. That means doing business transparently and with a sound governance structure. It also means being a good partner and an active contributor to society, by creating jobs, paying taxes and respecting the environment.

We work with the governments and institutions of the countries in which we operate to develop and deliver our strategy – which helps them realise their goals for sustainable development while ensuring our strict and continued compliance with local laws and regulations.

# Win with technology

We aim to create a leading, modernised network that provides the data capacity to meet rapidly growing demand and supports connectivity and digitalisation in our markets.

That means improving basic network uptime, quality and resilience as well as expanding our network footprint and our 4G capabilities, while developing our 5G capacity in readiness for predicted 5G demand. To reflect the importance of IT capabilities and technology in reaching our customers, we renamed this pillar from 'Win with network' to 'Win with technology' this year.

# Our priorities

Expanding the reach of 4G coverage and building capacity through our  $2G > 3G > 4G$  approach

Investing in 5G spectrum to make our network future-ready

Focusing on rural coverage expansion through new site rollouts, recognising that access to a reliable service is the critical first step for reaching previously underserved communities

Focusing on our network resilience and service continuity, and adding capacity through aggregation

Building and modernising our network through optimal end-to-end design, including spectrum additions

# Our progress

We continue to focus on delivering best-in-class service and 4G networks in our markets, while ensuring our network is ready for future 5G demand by investing in 5G spectrum and technological capabilities in key markets. Our goal is to be the market leader everywhere we operate, while continuing to include more people in our network, particularly in underserved rural areas. This year we made significant investments in our network, technology and spectrum, while maintaining our services in the face of challenges that included fuel price inflation and fuel shortages – we also made progress in initiatives with our suppliers to increase the use of renewable energy and reduce fuel dependency.

As part of ensuring we are ready for 5G demand, in addition to purchasing spectrum we grew our fibre infrastructure and tested our 5G capabilities. We invested in data centres while exploring their potential for additional revenue streams from third-party users. We continued to improve our fibre provision in metro, intercity, and international networks, including through cost-effective partnerships and co-investment programmes.

We increased data speeds as well as coverage. In addition to our KPIs, below, we track our progress by measures which include data consumption, which increased from 1.8 million terabytes to 2.6 million terabytes and the number of new sites in rural areas, a target that supports our sustainability strategy: this year we added 1,100 new sites in rural areas.

# How we measure progress

We measure progress through several KPIs, described on pages 18-19, including:

Total sites and data capacity: we deployed more than 2,700 additional sites, reaching 31,546 sites in total as of 31 March 2023. During the year, we added 3,200+ more sites to 4G (90% of sites now on 4G) and added an incremental 6,000+ km of fibre (70,500+ km of fibre as of March 2023). Data capacity increased by 41.2% to 23,900+ terabytes (TB) per day, with peak hour data utilisation at 47.4%. In addition, 42.9% of our sites are in rural locations and our network availability is 99.61% as of 31 March 2023.

# Win with distribution

We aim to build on our unique distribution network to increase our ability to reach and serve customers in all our markets by making our services visible and accessible. Our distribution network empowers our business by extending our brand and ability to offer inter-linked services, as well as through customer recruitment and retention.

# Our priorities

Strengthening our distribution infrastructure to win more quality customers by increasing our depth and width, with a particular focus on rural areas

Enhancing the customer's experience through simplified digital customer onboarding processes, including the Know Your Customer (KYC) process

Cross-selling new digital services to our existing customer base

Broadening our offer to enhance usage and ARPU, while further granulating our approach to distribution so we can focus faster and more responsively on the needs and issues of customers in smaller geographies, increasing our net customer reach.

# Our progress

We have continued to expand our distribution network to get closer to customers and increase our visibility, developing our infrastructure and achieving net additions as reflected in the KPIs.

Our physical distribution network remains key to our success, and we expanded our ecosystem of customer activation outlets from 251,000+ to 304,000+ this year, while consolidating the services we can offer at a single outlet. At the same time, we're enhancing our digital distribution capability to stay ahead of the penetration of smartphones, and we remain focused on MyAirtel app and other self-serve functionality. Fast, effective digital onboarding is also a continuing priority, bringing new customers to our service in ways that are  $100 \%$

compliant with local Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements while being as efficient as possible, including by recording biometric information where this is a requirement. Through digital registration, most onboarding processes are achieved in five minutes or less.

We tackled a number of challenges over the year. We addressed shortages of SIM cards in some markets by integrating SIM sales with onboarding and have enhanced our offer for e-SIM-capable smartphones. The increasing uptake of the MyAirtel app has helped mitigate currency shortages in some markets.

As smartphone penetration increases and our 4G network expands, we expect further migration from voice to data services, and we look for further opportunities to recruit data customers, such as our partnership with New World TV in 2022, which enabled Airtel TV subscribers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Chad, Niger, Madagascar and the Seychelles to enjoy exclusive, live access to all FIFA World Cup 2022™ matches.

# How we measure progress

We measure distribution through several KPIs, described on pages 18-19, including:

Customer base and net adds: our customer base grew by  $9.0\%$  to 140 million as of 31 March 2023. Customer activating outlets grew by  $21.0\%$  to 304,000+. The overall growth reflects our investment in sales and distribution infrastructure, including our exclusive Airtel Money distribution channel of kiosks and branches. Our enhanced distribution channel ensures availability of SIM cards, recharge cards and money float.

# Our 'Win with distribution' strategy in action

# Zambia: delivering excellent execution to reach more customers

Excellent execution is key to winning with distribution. Everywhere we operate we aim to increase our productivity, accelerate our subscriber growth and improve our market share. Across the Group, we focus on aligning our distribution and marketing campaigns, and continue to identify opportunities for productivity improvements in areas that are typically underserved – what we call 'hyper-growth' opportunities, which can be rural or urban depending on local circumstances.

This year, Airtel Zambia was a high-performing market, delivering on distribution by getting closer to customers – as of 31 March 2023, we had 189,000+ distribution touchpoints (recharge selling outlets and Airtel money agents) across the country, an increase of  $39.5\%$  year-on-year, and 117,000 Airtel Money agents, an increase of  $47.5\%$ .

Those distribution touchpoints are nurtured - we want people to want to work with us, so we've built our employer brand and reward structure for the people who work for us directly, and people who earn through working with Airtel Zambia. Our team supervises the network carefully, visiting sites to check they have sufficient float, and helping our agents understand the business case for each Airtel Africa offering, so they can more effectively serve customers. Our ecosystem of distribution touchpoints is also carefully targeted: our cluster planning makes our distribution more efficient, and we aim to ensure customers can access SIM cards, recharge and mobile money at every site. Our My Airtel app is also playing a vital role in Zambia, as described on page 47.

As a result, our revenue in Zambia grew by  $32.4\%$  in 2022/23, driving revenue growth for both data and mobile money services. Our customer base in Zambia grew by  $15.1\%$  to 8 million customers.

# Our 'Win with data' strategy in action

# The Democratic Republic of the Congo: demand for data resilient, even in challenging times

Across our markets, demand for data continues to grow fast - even in a year in which many customers felt the pressure of fuel shortages and food price inflation. It shows that if we can stay ahead through the strength of our technology and distribution networks, there is clear potential for future growth.

In the DRC, for example, we were able to grow our 4G data customer base by  $37.5\%$  to 1.9 million and increase 4G customer penetration as a percentage of our total data customer base to  $47.5\%$  – this means that almost half of our data customers are using 4G technology in the DRC. This growth in customers came at a time of significant data demand. To support this expansion, we reinforced our 4G network, which added  $280+$  sites in the DRC over the year, while strengthening our ability to get close to customers through our distribution system.

Boosting our smartphone offer through competitive pricing has also played an important role in the DRC, alongside the reliability of our network – and we took steps to widen our supplier base and increase the frequency of supplies.

These investments have paid off: our total data usage in the DRC increased by  $63\%$  to 183.2 million GB.

# Win with data

We aim to maximise the value of data-based services and increase data penetration in all our markets. That means encouraging smartphone ownership and increasing data usage at scale, while increasing access to the digital economy for customers in all our markets.

# Our priorities

Leveraging our 4G network for data ARPU and revenue growth and using our technology to win and/or maintain market leadership

Investing in 5G capabilities to be ready for future demand

Smartphone offerings for all new handsets through well-priced, transparent bundles

Further developing our wireless home broadband business

Developing innovative products and data solutions for corporate and SME customers through Airtel Business

Continuing to focus on data security for our customers in line with our sustainability strategy

# Our progress

Driving success in our 'Win with data' pillar is closely linked to our ability to extend and maintain fast, reliable networks, and to being close to our customers through our distribution organisation. This year we saw the number of data customers rise to 54.6 million alongside the expansion of our 4G network and the continued increase in broadband customers. Our data capacity grew rapidly to  $23,900+$  TB per day, and we added  $3,200+$  4G sites to our network, which means we're including more people than ever, as well as offering higher speeds and capacity. Our investment in 5G spectrum and capabilities in Kenya, Nigeria and Zambia ensures we will

be ready to meet 5G demand. The strong presence of our outlets and our marketing investment support this network advantage. To keep customers' data secure, we now hold certification in 'Information Security Management System' (ISO 27001), and 'Business Continuity Management System' (ISO 22301), which cover all mobile communication and mobile money operations in all our markets.

While the rate of smartphone penetration growth slowed this year in many markets as consumers faced cost-of-living pressures, we continued to recruit smartphone users, driven by innovative products and partnerships with smartphone sellers. A range of offers and products drove increased usage, including Airtel TV. Overall, data usage grew by  $46.3\%$ , demonstrating the strength of demand.

# How we measure progress

We measure data through several KPIs, described on pages 18-19, including:

Data customers, 4G data customers and penetration. Our data customer base increased by  $16.9\%$  to 54.6 million as of 31 March 2023, and now constitutes  $39.0\%$  of our total customer base. Our total data usage increased by  $46.3\%$  to 2.6 million TB. Data usage per customer per month reached 4.4 GB, an increase of  $29.1\%$ . 4G data usage contributed  $74.5\%$  to total data usage.

Data revenue grew by  $23.8\%$  and data ARPU was $3.0, up by  $9.3\%$  in constant currency.

# Win with mobile money

We aim to accelerate the digital ecosystem by rapidly enabling Airtel Money services in all our markets, harnessing the ability of a profitable mobile money business to enhance financial inclusion in some of the most 'unbanked' populations in the world.

# Our priorities

Further strengthening our distribution channel of kiosks, mini shops and dedicated Airtel Money branches, so customers can access assured float and cash

Build and scale Airtel Money across all our markets

Continuing to recruit customers from our mobile services base using recharge as an enabler

Make Airtel Money the currency of choice by expanding our mobile money portfolio through additional mobile money services, including merchant payments

Enterprise and digital payments, including commercial payments, benefit transfers, loans and savings

Developing our fintech services as we move towards providing platform services (loans and international money transfers)

Focusing on technology as an enabler and competitive advantage

# Our progress

We have widened our customer base and driven increased revenues while substantially increasing the reach and depth of our mobile money offer. We continue to focus on our distribution network and float availability through our Airtel Money branches, which expanded by  $11.5\%$  in 2022/23, and kiosks, which increased by

10.8%. We also increased the number of multi-brand agents in our network by 44%. This has resulted in the growth of our customer base to 31.5 million and we encourage female customers who are historically underserved by financial services in many of our markets to use our financial products and services. We continue to use recharges as an enabler for recruiting customers from our mobile services base.

We have invested in our technology and our people to ensure we have the capabilities and skills we need to increase Airtel Money's acceptance as the currency of choice across the financial ecosystem. Among other metrics, this has seen the value of international money transfers increase by  $33.7\%$ .

At the same time, we began to gear up our offering in Nigeria following the granting of our Payment Service Bank (PSB) licence by the Central Bank of Nigeria in April 2022.

# How we measure progress

We measure mobile money progress through several KPIs, described on pages 18-19, including:

Airtel Money customer base and penetration: our Airtel Money customer base grew by  $20.4\%$  to 31.5 million. Airtel Money transaction value and transaction value per customer: our transaction value grew by  $41.3\%$  to  $\$ 88.6$ bn in constant currency. Transaction value per customer grew by  $16.4\%$  in constant currency.

Airtel Money revenue grew by  $29.6\%$  and Airtel Money ARPU was $2.0, up by  $6.8\%$  in constant currency.

Improving customer experience is an essential part of accelerating the digital ecosystem – so we're focused on making mobile money services as seamless and trouble-free as possible. Our 'quick loan' product is designed to do just that – helping customers make payments when and where they want to, reducing the number of failed transactions, and smoothing the mobile money experience.

We introduced quick loans after spotting the number of failed transactions that resulted from customers having insufficient funds in their mobile wallets to cover the transaction value or their fees. We offer a one-time instant loan to cover the fee or value, up to their credit limit. The loan attracts a low fee, and is available for buying goods and services, paying bills, buying airtime, or money transfers – whatever the customer needs.

The product has rapidly become very popular in markets such as Uganda, which was among the first to pilot it. Demand in Uganda had reached \(7.9m per month by March 2023 – often driven by customers such as micro-traders who choose to buy their stock in the morning and repay their loan in the evening after trading. The 866,000+ quick loans taken up by 254,000+ customers in Uganda have opened up new financial inclusion opportunities for young entrepreneurs like Ivan Baguma who runs his health supplements business in Kampala. It has also helped drive 20.5% Airtel Money revenue growth in Uganda in 2022/23.

# Our 'Win with people' strategy in action

# Building opportunity for the careers of the future

The digital opportunity is full of transformative potential – for our customers and communities, and for our employees. In October 2022 we launched our ‘Women in Tech’ programme to help ensure that our most promising female talent – those who scored high performance marks in several consecutive years – contribute their skills and expertise to key projects.

The 12-month programme focuses on business challenges in the digital and tech space – with participants working together to identify and design complete business solutions that address some of our biggest opportunities. The 58 women taking part in our first programme are being mentored by senior leaders and female Board members and will present their proposals and business plans to our executive team at the end of their training.

# 'Paying it forward': inspiring the female talent of tomorrow

This programme is open to any high-performing woman working in areas with a strong technical focus and aims to accelerate participants' career potential through training in design thinking, problem identification and problem solving, and presentation skills.

It reflects our commitment to providing opportunities and support to female employees as part of building gender equality in our workforce. It is also an example of our 'pay it forward' philosophy, because the participants in the course are already inspiring and mentoring other talented women in our business, including through a global seminar on International Women's Day in March 2023.

# Win with cost

We aim to achieve an efficient operational model, leading to an effective cost structure and improved margins. This enables us to build large incremental capacity at low marginal cost.

# Our priorities

Our cost-efficiency initiatives, which seek to optimise site operational and maintenance expenses, and bandwidth cost

A detailed analysis of expenses with the aim of improving operating margins in individual markets

Ensuring fail-safe network design with optimal cost structures, for example through multiple fibre routes and high-capacity indefeasible right of usage (IRUs)

Increasing availability of digital recharges and self-care services

# Our progress

The aim of our cost model is to ensure that we can provide substantial additional capacity to serve our customers in all our markets, at marginal additional cost. We do this through optimising our network design, a constant focus on value in our inputs and our contracts, and volume optimisation.

This year, rapid increases in the cost of the fuel we need to run our sites placed significant pressure on our cost base, while devaluations and currency shortages in some markets also created headwinds. SIM card price increases added to costs. However, we were able to maintain underlying EBITDA margins at broadly similar levels to 2021/22 thanks to a range of cost initiatives, including close collaboration with suppliers.

We continue to look for areas where we can share costs and increase our operational resilience while improving our offer to customers – for example, by exploring options for partnerships on fibre or data centre resources.

# How we measure progress

Underlying EBITDA for 2022/23 was \(2,575m, up by 17.3% in constant currency. Underlying EBITDA margin was 49.0%.

# Win with people

We aim to be the employer of choice with a diverse and inclusive work environment that continues to foster a culture of high performance, employee wellbeing, skills enhancement and coaching. We have a long-term commitment to our people and our employer brand.

# Our priorities

Ensuring we have the right people in the right jobs, with the right skills and at the right cost

Accelerating our diverse pipeline of talent to meet current and future business needs

Improving leadership and functional skills through coaching, our digital learning platform, functional learning programmes and cognitive assessments

Digitising our people processes to improve the overall employee experience and make Airtel Africa an even more engaging place to work

Continually improving our processes and procedures and evolving our work environment to ensure we remain an attractive employer that recruits and retains the best

# Our progress

Our business depends on having the right people in the right jobs, with the right skills. We have continued to focus on talent, capability and technology to bring the best out of our people and deliver the best results for the business, and our Group's overall results in the face of global and local headwinds this year demonstrate that we are on the right track. In 2022/23 we continued to apply a 'build or buy' succession strategy, and our internal development programmes resulted in a  $42\%$  internal promotions into new or existing roles, while we also reduced our 'time-to-hire' time significantly. Our Airtel Africa mobility programme, designed to support talent development and skills transfer across the Group, enabled high-potential employees to deepen their skills and enhance experience through cross-functional, cross-border roles.

Our gender diversity stands at  $26\%$  women in our workforce, and we launched our ‘Women in Tech’ programme to further develop our pipeline of female talent.

As our ways of working are underpinned by a strong governance framework, we also built our people's understanding of the Code of Conduct through a mandatory refresher training course available in English and French, and ensured all new hires were trained in our global Code of Conduct.

Digitalisation is an important part of our approach, and we continued to develop our digital learning platforms and expand the ways in which we engage with employees. Our employee engagement survey continues to provide us with regular insight and feedback from our people.

Further details of our engagement and programmes, including our employee assistance programme, are on pages 44 and 45 in the stakeholder section.

# How we measure progress

We measure our progress on people through a number of KPIs, including:

- Diversity - by gender (26% women in our workforce, 29% women in ExCo at the OpCo level) and nationality (employees from 39 nationalities).  
Skills development - we delivered key functional and leadership training through accelerated on-demand learning programmes, which in return improved productivity and overall performance.  
- Employee engagement – our bi-annual employee engagement survey achieved a  $91\%$  response rate in 2022/23, a  $4\%$  improvement from 2020/21 engagement level, with an overall engagement score of  $81\%$  which is a  $2\%$  increase from the previous score.  
Voluntarily attrition rate is  $13\%$ .

We published our sustainability strategy in October 2021 – a blueprint for the future of our business, the people we employ and the communities we serve. A year later, in October 2022, we published our inaugural Sustainability Report. It is aligned to the requirements of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) reporting standards. It also provides full data and detailed updates on our progress against our goals and targets, including specific information on our sustainability governance and partnerships. In both our sustainability strategy and the Sustainability Report 2022, we committed to full transparency in our reporting and to regular and timely updates on our progress.

Ahead of the publication of our next Sustainability Report in 2024, we're taking this opportunity to provide our stakeholders with a summary of our sustainability-related work over the last six months.

# Pillar 1

# Our business

This pillar of our sustainability strategy underpins our commitment to transform lives across Africa through the provision of safe, reliable and resilient connectivity to drive economic growth and development. Our ambition is to increase digital inclusion across the continent through the expansion and increased reliability of our network, to keep our customers' data safe and protected at all times, and to ensure our entire value chain adheres to our ESG principles.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/b466c5e8-a974-4f7e-87ee-1dc562965b0e/81ad4fcd3dadc6a7447ff833f2f93931266ff7f5c8f54bda8246557ea67d0343.jpg)

# Our data security goal

Our commitment is to guarantee that our data privacy and security controls are among the best in the world. It is our highest priority material topic.

Our goal is to establish industry-leading data security for our customers. We will achieve this through investment in technology and expertise, updated processes, and consumer awareness, delivered through programmes with clear targets and timelines.

MATERIAL TOPIC: DATA SECURITY

# We aim to establish an internal control framework that aligns with industry standards and create internal capability to reduce our dependency on partners.

We recognise our responsibility to provide customers with best-in-class protection for their personal and financial information.

Our focus areas:

- Confidentiality – protecting information from being exposed to unauthorised parties and keeping sensitive information private.  
- Integrity - ensuring the constant reliability of our data, networks and systems.  
- Availability - ensuring authorised users have access to the systems, networks and data they need, and resolving hardware and software conflicts to build design resilience.

Certification has been a key focus for us in the last six months. In addition to preparing for the second annual audit of our ISO 27001 ISMS and ISO 22301 BCMS certification, in November 2022 we started working towards ISO certification for SmartCash PSB (Payment Service Bank) Nigeria. These standards are vital in helping us establish a robust management framework and ensuring business and operational continuity. We have also introduced an industry-leading 'email gateway solution' which will manage and filter all inbound and outbound email traffic to protect our organisation from email-borne threats and data leaks. We anticipate this will be fully rolled out by the end of 2023.

To help our people and partners keep their information secure, in December 2022 we conducted a phishing simulation and have made training available to all employees and suppliers to reduce the risk of an

attack. We have also published comprehensive online safety information on all our consumer-facing websites to help customers protect their digital identities and personal information.

To complement a redesign of our vulnerability management programme, in February 2023 we appointed an independent partner to test for weaknesses in our external facing assets. We have also upgraded our privilege access management solution which ensures no unauthorised access to data. This work has been completed in January 2023.

We have put Group-wide cybersecurity insurance in place to reduce our exposure to the impact of any unsolicited and unwanted cybersecurity events. In addition, as part of our security incident management implementation, we enhanced our process to provide a robust response in case of any security attack. Our dedicated 24/7 security team is responsible for continuously monitoring 'attack surface' to stop breaches by minimising risk from exposed assets and involve relevant stakeholders, as necessary. We also engaged an external security organisation, which monitors for cyber attacks and can respond to incidents when needed. For more information on our principal risks, see pages 90-97.

# We updated our ransomware protection policy

Ransomware is when malicious attackers encrypt an organisation's data and demand payment to restore access. In February 2023 we updated our ransomware protection policy to guard against this growing cyberthreat.

This policy is designed to minimise and manage the risks associated with ransomware attacks on Airtel Africa. The updated policy sets out the mechanisms we have in place to identify our risk of a ransomware attack, and the controls around people, process and technology we will implement if a risk is detected.

# Our data security in action

# Information security week – raising awareness among employees

Information security is a key focus area for us and our stakeholders – and we know it needs to be a shared responsibility for everyone at Airtel Africa. In February 2023, we launched our internal information security awareness week in three of our markets, helping our employees understand best security practices so they can help us reduce the possibility of service outages due to security incidents, data breaches, potential financial losses and reputational damage.

During the week, interactive events and activities in Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia focused on awareness activities and information security training, with online quizzes and contests to bring security messages to life, and 'cyber-mascots' who toured our offices to deliver spot quizzes.

We've seen a rapid increase in awareness in the markets where the awareness week was launched – and will extend the scheme to other markets in 2023/24.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/b466c5e8-a974-4f7e-87ee-1dc562965b0e/fb6a6f84561c1765ff8f9a4fb9e064c9c0ab2323b927a669c3f28f10b86623ee.jpg)

# Our service quality goal

Our goal is to provide underserved communities with access to reliable network and connectivity across our 14 markets.

Providing network accessibility to rural areas is key to building digital inclusion. We will achieve it through the rollout of new infrastructure sites and technology, improved fibre connectivity and capacity delivered through programmes with clear targets and timelines.

MATERIAL TOPIC: SERVICE QUALITY

# We aim to create a leading, modernised network that can provide data capacity to meet rapidly growing demand and enhance connectivity and digitalisation in our markets.

By expanding our network, we're helping to build digital inclusion for communities across Africa.

Our focus areas:

- Accessibility – increasing the percentage of the population in each of our markets – including in rural areas – who have access to our services.  
- Delivery – increasing the availability of our latest technology service offerings and products to all our customers.  
- Reliability - ensuring our customers have access to reliable connectivity and high bandwidth capacity.

Over the last six months, we have expanded rural coverage through new site rollouts and site modernisations to ensure uninterrupted network resilience and service continuity. We continued to deploy optimal end-to-end design, including spectrum additions in several markets, latest RAN (radio access network) technology and fibre rollout, and best-in-class voice service quality.

At the close of our financial year, over  $79.45\%$  of the population in our markets had access to our network and over  $65.88\%$  of the population was covered by 4G. This is in line with the rollout timeline we had set.

We're also readying the business for 5G demand. Alongside acquiring 5G spectrum, we had made preparations for 5G launch in Nigeria, Kenya, Zambia and Tanzania by 31 March 2023. Work is underway to prepare for the launch of 5G in another two markets in 2023/24.

Expansion of coverage  

<table><tr><td>Total sites</td><td>31,546</td></tr><tr><td>Sites with 3G</td><td>30,866</td></tr><tr><td>Sites with 4G</td><td>28,476</td></tr></table>

Not only does 5G provide optimal service to our customers, it was also designed – from its inception – to be highly energy efficient. Moving data over 5G uses  $90\%$  less energy than LTE (long-term evolution)* and 5G workloads can be uploaded to the cloud where any associated emissions become the shared responsibility of the entire value chain. As part of our sustainability strategy, we have set a commitment to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Energy efficiency – and the contribution of 5G – is a critical consideration in this.

We have soft launched VoLTE (voice over long-term evolution) in Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda and Zambia and will begin trials in the DRC and Tanzania in 2023/24. We have also launched several campaigns to promote attractive voice bundles to our customers.

Our uninterrupted mobile service reliability – or quality of experience (QoE) – has also improved. Our network availability is now the highest ever for the business pan-Africa combined RNA (radio network availability) with a value of  $99.61\%$  as of 31 March 2023. At  $91.07\%$ , our voice quality index is also at an all-time high, as is our DQI (data quality index) of  $87.86\%$  as of 31 March 2023. This level of network availability and quality index builds customers' confidence in their quality of experience while making a voice call, streaming a home broadband video or connecting to family and friends, especially during high demand.

# Providing better services for more customers in Kenya

During the reporting period in Kenya we focused on ensuring our 4G network is ready to sustain our customers with 5G technology tomorrow – to do so, in July 2022 we acquired 60 MHz in the 2600 MHz spectrum band for a period of 15 years. And we have already made 56 sites 5G-ready as of 31 March 2023.

To further increase our capability, we deployed 350 additional infrastructure sites reaching the total number of 3,163 sites as of 31 March 2023. We also laid out  $900+$  km of fibre reaching a total of  $8,900+$  km in 2022/23.

As a result, data capacity increased by  $82.7\%$  to 3,047 terabytes (TB) per day, with peak hour data utilisation at  $43\%$ . Overall, in Kenya we cover  $85\%$  of rural population and approximately  $46\%$  of our sites are in remote areas.

# Our supply chain management goal

Our goal is to ensure all our suppliers are aligned with our ESG principles.

Our stakeholders hold us accountable for this and we expect our suppliers to uphold high standards in human and labour rights, environmental performance as well as business ethics. We maintain that there is no place for the abuse of employee rights, violations of legislation, regulation or governance standards, or environmental negligence in our supply chain.

MATERIAL TOPIC: SUPPLY CHAIN

# As a responsible organisation, we look further than our own business and we aim to drive change and positive improvement through our entire value chain.

Our goal is to ensure all our suppliers are aligned with our ESG criteria, upholding high standards in human rights, labour rights, environmental performance and business ethics.

Our focus areas are:

- Enhanced due diligence – increasing the pre-contract disclosures we expect of potential vendors and suppliers.  
- Ongoing ESG compliance – reviewing the ESG standards, policies and controls of existing vendors and suppliers.

In the six months from October 2022, our main priority was to maintain an ongoing supply of equipment, fuel and services despite the geopolitical turbulence and shortages caused by the residual impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Over that period, we continued to increase our supplier base with contracts awarded to new suppliers or vendors while improving onboarding process. Work has started on the development of ESG disclosure requirements for new suppliers and we anticipate that this will be incorporated into our onboarding process by Q4'24.

We also focused on existing suppliers and undertook a detailed analysis of the results from an ESG self-assessment questionnaire (ESG SAQ) which was sent to our top 100 suppliers and vendors (by procurement spend) in September 2022 to gather information on their ESG standards, processes and policies. With the response rate of  $79\%$ , we were in a good position to carry out detailed analysis of the feedback we received. With this analysis in place, we're now developing a robust self-certification process for suppliers and vendors which we will introduce in 2023/24.

# Engagement with our top tier partners

Engaging our partners, vendors and suppliers in the delivery of our sustainability goals is critical. Scope 3 emissions account for over  $80\%$  of our total GHG emissions, and it is vital we work in partnership to develop robust decarbonisation programmes and initiatives across our value chain. In March 2023, we completed 'deep dive' consultations with our top tier partners, who account for  $78\%$  of our scope 3 emissions. Our aim was to communicate our sustainability strategy goals with a particular focus on the reduction of GHG emissions.

The consultation revealed that while our top tier partners are at very different stages of developing their decarbonisation plans – from those that have set net zero targets to those who are just starting to address emissions – they are deploying significant resources to their decarbonisation ambitions. We're pleased that our partners have committed to enhancing disclosure of their GHG emissions data to help us accurately monitor and report our scope 3 emissions.

# Membership of the Joint Audit Corporation (JAC)

Airtel Africa is a member of the Joint Audit Corporation (JAC) which represents telecoms service providers, most of whom have vendors and suppliers in common. JAC will undertake on-site audits of five of our suppliers each year. In the six months from October 2022, we identified the suppliers and sites to be audited under the JAC guidance. These audits will take place by the end of 2023/24. JAC verifies and assesses implementation of ESG-related programmes across the leading suppliers to the ICT industry. Furthermore, JAC members collaborate to ensure best practice in the shared value chain, and we support corrective programmes that JAC encourage to improve ESG standards.

This membership will allow us to implement and enhance a periodic audit process for vendors and suppliers to monitor their compliance with our ESG criteria.

# Our commitment to creating a diverse and inclusive workforce

We continue to draw upon our broad range of policies, programmes and engagement initiatives to help us achieve this goal.

We are committed to delivering equality in our workforce. We will achieve this through recruitment and programmes to provide training and advancement for everyone regardless of gender, nationality or disability.

MATERIAL TOPIC: DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION

# Our people are critical to the delivery of our business and sustainability strategy.

Without our dedicated and talented workforce, we would not be able to achieve our growth objectives or deliver on our corporate purpose of transforming lives. Our commitment is to provide rewarding employment opportunities and a workplace where everyone can thrive and develop. This goes to the heart of who we are.

# Our commitment to creating a diverse and inclusive workforce

Increasing female representation throughout the organisation is a key focus for us. Over the past six months, we have appointed several women into senior level roles, including the finance director of Airtel Niger and the Group head of digital, both of whom were recruited externally. Providing opportunities for our own people is important, and we're delighted that a female employee has been promoted into the role of Group head of tax. In addition, we have worked with our recruitment consultancies across all 14 markets to ensure more female candidates are put forward for interviews.

# Mentoring and creativity helping Kenya win with people

Winning with people is vital in all our markets – because bringing the best out of our workforce lets our people fulfil their talent while driving our business success.

In markets where there's strong competition for talented people, we have to be particularly creative to win. This year, our annual 'Win with people' prize was awarded to Airtel Kenya, a highly competitive market where our teams have delivered a range of training and initiatives designed to improve retention in our workforce, keep our brand visible, and engage employees.

Developing high-potential employees through e-learning courses, leadership training and job-shadowing helps keep our talent pipeline flowing. In addition, Airtel Kenya's internship programme welcomed 20 interns to undertake projects across the business. Detailed mapping of the talent pool and well-executed onboarding programmes helped Airtel Kenya recruit 200 sales executives in two months.

Airtel Kenya is also delivering on our gender diversity ambitions. The OpCo's workforce is  $40 \%$ female as of 31 March 2023, and  $50 \%$ of the leadership team are women. Airtel Kenya is always looking for new ways to develop female talent: this year the mentorship programme run in partnership with ‘Girls for girls’ saw 12 female employees mentored and three mentors trained over a six- month course, with participants reporting positive changes in their confidence outlook and understanding of the opportunities they have to contribute to Airtel Africa.

# Provision of best practice training and development

Over the past six months, we have continued to build opportunities for our people to develop their careers through a range of online and in-person training and development programmes. These programmes focus on leadership and functional training and are designed to improve career mobility.

We have also updated Percipio, our online learning platform, to offer a personalised, immersive learning experience, including virtual workshops and access to relevant professional certifications. Since October 2022, more than 300 leaders have completed our 'Agile culture' course, and more than 5,300 employees and contractors have taken functional courses on Percipio, Xelerate and other online learning platforms.

Developing the next generation of women leaders in technology is vital for us. We currently have 58 women on our 'Women in Tech' programme, all of whom are being mentored by senior executives. We anticipate this programme will accelerate in 2023/24.

For more information about this programme, see our strategic pillar 'Win with people' on page 37

# Our commitment to maintaining a healthy and safe work environment

Our human resources and facilities teams work together to maintain a healthy and safe work environment for every one of our employees. This is reviewed monthly by the Sustainability Committee. Our human resources teams also work closely with internal audit and assurance to guarantee a continuous focus on health and safety in the workplace in line with our recently updated health, safety and security policy. In addition, we continue to focus on the individual health and safety of our employees through a partnership with our health insurer. This includes wellness check-ups, 24/7 access to medical advice and support for mental wellness.

# Engaging with our employees

In March 2023, we held the Group leadership conclave in Dubai which was attended by senior executives from 14 OpCos. An important focus of the session was our 'Win with people' strategy: we addressed the Board mandate for building on our work to increase diversity and inclusion, and how to embed our unique ways of working and commitment to our people. This year's leadership conclave was attended by around 250 leaders, a significant increase from previous years: we broadened the participation and included more manager-level participants. The three-day session allowed us to discuss our annual operations planning (AOP) and also enabled our Chair and leadership to interact with managers and employees from 14 OpCos and HQ.

In addition, chairpersons from our OpCo Boards attended and took the opportunity to engage with teams across the organisation and share insights into our culture and values. A plenary session was dedicated to our sustainability strategy and vision. The conclave was highly immersive, and all teams had an opportunity to engage with the senior leadership of the organisation as well as the Chair in person. Furthermore, we took time to award and recognise top-performing teams and individuals at the gala event. In addition, we organised several 'open mic' sessions, including a session with the Chair and the CEO during the closing remarks.

# Celebrating International Women's Day across Africa

We celebrated International Women's Day in March 2023 for the third consecutive year, supporting equality, diversity and inclusion-related initiatives and campaigns across our 14 markets. We adopted the UN Women's theme for this year: 'DigitALL: innovation and technology for gender equality'.

Employees took part in talks, debates and activities to recognise our growing female workforce across the Group and to consider some of the barriers and challenges facing women in the workplace. We held a Group-wide town hall led by our CEO to recognise the contribution of women at Airtel Africa and to the wider community.

There could not have been a better theme given today's global reality where technology underpins the way we live, work and play. I look forward to working together with Airtel Africa women to innovate and design new ideas for a brighter future.

# Employee assistance programme delivers after cyclones in Malawi

Cyclone Freddy struck Madagascar and Malawi in February and March 2023, causing devastating loss of life and damage to property and infrastructure. Alongside our efforts to support customers and communities through our network, we also supported our people – especially the 17 colleagues who lost their homes in the cyclone. Airtel Africa funded temporary accommodation while they awaited resettlement into new homes, and the ‘Airtel ladies’ welfare group, which is wholly employee-driven, organised donations of clothes, bedding, appliances and non-perishable food items to be sent to the employees and their families.

The cyclone was followed by an outbreak of cholera in Malawi, and we moved fast to protect our people in the affected southern region, suspending all but critical travel, and keeping employees updated through health and safety communications.

# Launching Airtel Women Network in Nigeria

In March 2023, we launched a programme called 'Airtel Women's Network' to encourage women to play an active role in technology and empower them to become global leaders. Through this platform, we support Airtel Africa women through mentorship and networking – to be able to pitch ideas, access the resources and participate in key technology projects.

This initiative is aligned with our commitment to increase gender diversity, and financial and digital inclusion in Africa.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/b466c5e8-a974-4f7e-87ee-1dc562965b0e/10a6058d9214947bfa2ad91d6b0d58f9d706f07d3f70dfb21e2dc875b034cf33.jpg)

# Pillar 3 Our community

Supporting communities across Africa is – and has always been – at the heart of our organisation. Our ambition is to drive digital and financial inclusion and access to education for people and communities across the continent through the provision of data and mobile services delivered through our network expansion. These are vital to the positive transformation of lives across Africa.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/b466c5e8-a974-4f7e-87ee-1dc562965b0e/53406c790a7f830559032b0389567b7a1e3e8fd31202076b2691d5f0b14eb5a6.jpg)

# Our digital inclusion goal

We are committed to improving the footprint of our network, and thereby offering higher coverage of populations across urban and rural markets.

Our goal is to significantly improve digital inclusion across Africa. We will do this by driving penetration of mobile telephony, smartphones and home broadband in rural areas through the provision of retail and support services. This will be key to addressing the digital divide.

MATERIAL TOPIC: DIGITAL INCLUSION

# The availability and affordability of our products and services are critical to driving digital inclusion.

By expanding our network, we're providing people with the opportunity to use telephony and internet services, often for the very first time, and increasing digital inclusion across Africa. But opportunity alone is not enough: consumers also need access to the products and services that enable them to take advantage of this opportunity.

Our focus areas:

- Rural penetration – increased penetration of mobile telephony in rural areas is a vital first step towards digital inclusion. For people to buy, use and understand their devices and digital services they must have access to local retail and customer support.  
- Affordability - encouraging use of our full range of digital services through the creation of more attractive and affordable options for home broadband and smartphone purchases.  
- Payment solutions – in pre-paid markets, the availability of digital services is dependent upon the availability of credit. We work to expand and develop more convenient payment solutions for our customers so that they're able to access digital services as and when they need to.

There has been a significant improvement in data capacity through the expansion of our network coverage and data availability. The continued rollout of new sites and upgrade of existing sites to 4G has increased the number of people in Africa who can now access the 4G network, especially in rural areas. Our rural population coverage stands at  $70\%$  as of 31 March 2023. We have also been encouraging customer uptake with the launch of data bundle offers designed specifically to appeal to the needs of customers in each market, with additional add-on offers available to existing users through the MyAirtel app – adoption of our data bundles grew by  $3.5\%$  to  $94.7\%$ .

According to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), globally,  $57\%$  of women use the internet compared with  $62\%$  of men. Of the estimated 2.7 billion people worldwide currently unconnects the majority are women and girls. We're addressing the digital gender divide by offering affordable and easy-to-use products, such as 'binning bundles' offering high benefits at a lower price with limited validity which allow people on lower income, typically women, to access data. This contributes to unlocking women's potential in the digital economy.

Since the internet has become part of everyday lives, our customers use it to work or for entertainment, and children use it to study and access learning platforms on their devices. In March 2023, we launched a new home broadband unlimited product in the Seychelles, the first of its kind, which allows customers to use wireless connectivity by just plugging in their device and browsing at a full 4G speed. Schoolchildren will also benefit from faster speed and ease of access to educational content. We plan to roll out the same home broadband proposition in other markets where we also launch 5G coverage in 2023/24.

We recognise that certain unmissable televised events can encourage otherwise undecided consumers to take the first step to getting online. We have partnered with FIFA to provide our customers with access to televised global football matches. Sport might bring customers to our services and products, but we're confident that the wider benefits will prove transformational to their lives and futures.

# DRC: supporting digitalisation through the National Digital Library

Supporting digitalisation is a central element of our strategy everywhere we operate – and in many markets, we work with government partners who also recognise the importance of access to data for individuals and the economy as a whole.

In the DRC, the government's Plan National du Numérique is a country-wide vision of a new digital economy. We're supporting this through the provision of free WiFi to universities harnessing the strength of our 3G and 4G networks to deliver high-speed, quality data in partnership with the Ministry of Higher and University Education (Ministère de l'Enseignement Supérieur et Universitaire).

The newly created Bibliothèque Numérique Nationale (National Digital Library) was launched in 2022 to improve the quality of academic training. It provides students with access to academic resources hosted in the Ministry's data centre located at CEDESURK library as well as other universities' sites. With more than 160 resource providers, including the Francophone University Agency (AUF), it's opening the door to a new world of digital education opportunities.

# Zambia: MyAirtel app boosts distribution and accelerates digital penetration

In Zambia, the rapid uptake of MyAirtel app, the self-care service, has been central to an overall drive on distribution that is tailored to meet the needs of Zambian customers – and which has seen growth of MyAirtel app active users by  $186\%$  in the market this year.

Airtel Zambia researched why and how customers used the app and followed up with a marketing campaign that focused on what customers found most important – for example, checking transactions, accuracy in sending and receiving money or paying bills.

MyAirtel app was downloaded 1.3 million times in Zambia by the end of the year, and our active users almost trebled from  $162,000+$  to  $465,000+$ .

# Touching lives in action

# Accelerating philanthropy in Nigeria

In 2022 Airtel Nigeria reaffirmed its commitment to empower and support underprivileged people across communities in our largest market at the start of the seventh edition of the flagship philanthropy programme 'Airtel touching lives'. In just over a month, 100,300 requests for support were received, recorded and processed. In line with our sustainability strategy, we focused on causes and opportunities aimed at bridging the digital gender divide, financial inclusion and the adoption of schools in 2022/23. For example, we partnered with The Whispering Hope Africa, a non-profit organisation which supports women, children and entrepreneurs in rural communities and provided 65 girls with fully paid tuition fees for one year, including a donation of 12 portable computers and a photocopier machine to enable learning.

Empowering women and girls plays an important part in our strategy for digital and financial inclusion – which is why we have also provided vital support to the Women's Technology Empowerment Centre (W. TEC), an NGO which builds IT capabilities having worked successfully with more than 1,500 women and girls in Nigeria over the past 14 years. In June 2022, Airtel Nigeria supported their work – which was threatened by electricity supply shortages – by donating solar panels and cell batteries to help keep the project running. At the same time, we supplied laptops and other IT equipment to foster their aim of achieving economic empowerment through technology.

During the sixth season of our 'Touching lives' programme, Airtel Nigeria has contributed N161,304,000.00 (equivalent of $350,000) to good causes for the benefit of the communities.

# Our financial inclusion goal

Financial inclusion is key to driving equality and economic growth

Our goal is to significantly increase financial inclusion in Africa – with particular support for women. We do this through the development of affordable financial products to meet the needs of the un- and under-banked, a reliable service which builds financial confidence and literacy.

MATERIAL TOPIC: FINANCIAL INCLUSION

# Financial inclusion is key to driving equality and economic growth.

Financial inclusion is a main driver to alleviate poverty and a critical goal of our sustainability strategy.

Our focus areas:

- Affordability - developing products and services that meet the needs of the un- and under-banked is crucial.  
- Accessibility - ensuring our products and services are available when and where our customers need them.  
- Awareness - empowering consumers with the knowledge, tools and confidence to use financial products responsibly.

In the past six months, our work to improve financial inclusion has developed through several programmes which have resulted in an increased uptake and use of digital payments. In the year to March 2023, we have seen the value of transactions per Airtel Money subscriber increase by  $16.4\%$  as a result of the launch of a number of new products and an increased presence in our markets.

We understand that being near our customers helps drive uptake of our products which, in turn, positively impacts financial inclusion. Over the last year we have increased our 'points of presence' – Airtel Money locations where customers can access services – by  $44\%$ , with a  $12\%$  increase in Airtel Money branches and an  $11\%$  increase in the number of kiosks.

We have further supported this through investment in the technology infrastructure behind our developer, biller and enterprise portals. This underpins our merchant business, which extends our footprint by enabling customers to bank and access savings, loans and insurance products at merchant sites.

We have also expanded our international money transfer corridors, allowing customers to send and receive money faster and to and from more destinations.

The economic empowerment of women has been, and will remain, a focus for us. Across our markets, most informal businesses are run and managed by women who, traditionally, do not have the same access to credit as men. We continue to offer our financial products and services to all customers, regardless of their gender. We work hard to encourage women to join our network and use our services, and to learn about our products that will provide them with independence and empowerment.

We have also focused on promoting household savings through innovative deposit products. For example, in March 2023, Airtel Tanzania partnered with Letshego Bank for a digital savings campaign that will see mobile money customers win prizes, such as motorcycles, flat-screen TVs and cash. This innovative product encourages Airtel Money customers and the public to make savings digitally.

# Supporting women entrepreneurs through financial inclusion in Kenya

Lucie Saulinah Omondi is the founder of LiveGreatAgriLife in Nairobi, Kenya, a peanut butter factory and drinking water purification shop. She uses Airtel Money services to help run her business.

"Our business is located in Kibera, the largest informal settlement in Nairobi, where access to clean drinking water and quality food can be a challenge. We are committed to providing our community with delicious and nutritious peanut butter, peanut butter products and safe drinking water. Our peanut butter is made from high-quality locally sourced peanuts, and is available in a variety of sizes and tastings. Our drinking water is purified using state-of-the-art filtration systems, ensuring that it is safe and healthy to drink. As a socially responsible business, we're proud to support a foundation that works to uplift the settlement area where we operate."

"In four years of learning and overcoming challenges and slow but steady growth, I have been able to build a dedicated team and we're currently focusing on our online sales. I have to say Airtel Money's product is a huge support in collecting money for our produce and services."

We continue getting closer to our customers to ensure that they can always reach us when needed. In Kenya, our Airtel Money branches grew by  $50.3\%$ , kiosks by  $66.5\%$  and the number of agents increased by  $189.7\%$  in 2022/23, providing support to valued customers like Lucie Saulinah Omondi.

# Partnerships in action

# Financial Inclusion Fund (the Hustler Fund) initiative in Kenya

Partnering with governments to help drive digital and financial inclusion is an important part of our strategy – and one of the ways we help transform lives.

In November 2022, we joined the Kenyan government's Financial Inclusion Fund initiative – the Hustler Fund – which focuses on extending lending and savings for small- and medium-size enterprises, many of which are run by women.

More than 19 million people have registered to access the Hustler Fund nationally and Airtel Money had disbursed KES  $500 + m$  (equivalent of  $\$ 3.67$ m) through the fund delivering services to over a million transacting customers as of 31 March 2023.

Our goal is to transform the lives of over one million children through education by 2027.

MATERIAL TOPIC: EDUCATION AND DIGITAL LITERACY

Providing access to quality education is central to our corporate purpose and philosophy.

We believe education is the key to transforming lives and the futures of young people across Africa. We have set ourselves the goal of transforming the lives of over one million children on the continent through education by 2027.

We will achieve this goal through three focused activity programmes.

- Partnerships - we are committed to working in collaboration to increase access to quality education. Our landmark partnership with UNICEF is a critical element of this.  
- Connectivity for education – connecting schools to the internet wherever our network services are available.  
- School adoption – building long-term relationships with schools in need to provide them with the support they require.

The World Bank calculated that, in 2019,  $87\%$  of African children were unable to read by the age of 10. And Covid-19 only exacerbated that problem. This is why our work to increase access to education across our 14 markets is so important. By connecting schools, libraries and youth centres to the internet, millions of children will be able to use online learning platforms. Through our partnership with UNICEF, we're delivering practical and financial support. All these elements work together to accelerate our commitment to build better futures for the young people of Africa.

# Our landmark partnership with UNICEF

We continue to focus on driving our partnership with UNICEF forward by increasing collaboration between our 13 participating  $\text{OpCos}^*$  and the respective national UNICEF teams. We're establishing effective plans to connect schools to the internet and provide access to government-approved education resources and learning platforms free of charge. Every market is different, so individual implementation plans are critical to the success of the programme on the ground. To support this effort, we hosted a joint Airtel Africa/UNICEF convention in Nairobi in February 2023. This was an important event, bringing teams on both sides of the partnership together to share ideas, address the challenges we face in some markets with the implementation of initiatives, and agree the rollout and advocacy plans for the second year of the partnership at both national and regional levels.

Kenya was the first to launch its national programme with UNICEF, and another five countries have launched their programmes by 31 March 2023: Nigeria, Madagascar, Uganda, Rwanda, and the Republic of the Congo. We anticipate that the remaining seven countries will be launched in the first quarter of 2023/24. As the programmes launch, we see an immediate impact. For example, in Nigeria, the partnership has already resulted in 20 schools being connected to the internet for the first time. Another 600 schools

will follow in Q1'24 equipped with 15,000 tablets and 600 routers which have been distributed to primary and secondary schools by the Federal Ministry of Education of Nigeria. Airtel Kenya, meanwhile, also connected 30 schools to the internet through this partnership and two government-approved learning platforms – Elimika for teachers and Education Cloud for children – are now fully accessible at no cost to users.

# Airtel Nigeria commissions the largest primary school in Gombe State

In March 2023, Airtel Nigeria commissioned its seventh adopted school, Government Day Primary. The project was inaugurated by the Emir of Gombe, alongside other notable guests in Pantami, Gombe State. The opening ceremony follows the renovation of 12 blocks of 37 classrooms and a total of 17 washroom facilities which have now been upgraded to modern facilities for the pupils and teachers. Airtel Nigeria is the first to carry out such intervention in the school and the whole of Gombe state. Government Day Primary School is said to be the largest primary school in Gombe state, with a total population of 7,119 pupils registered under the school for basic education, and 135 teachers who cater to their educational needs. As part of the programme 'Adopt a school', Airtel Nigeria adopts schools in rural areas and rehabilitates them at least for four years. This is in line with our commitment to improving the standard of education in Nigeria, and since the inception, we have remained committed to the development of these schools.

# Kenya: partnerships accelerating our 'Adopt a school' programme

Fair access to education should be available to the most vulnerable in society – and in November 2022, Airtel Kenya worked with the Kenya Directorate of Children Services (DCS) and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) on an initiative supporting adolescents who have transitioned from rehabilitation schools to continue their secondary education and reintegrate into society.

In partnership with two high schools in Eldoret, Kenya, this 'Adopt a school' initiative will see 21 adolescents benefit from the programme. Airtel Kenya will cover the students' school fees and other education-related expenses over three years, while also supporting one of the schools with connectivity for its IT hub.

# Uganda: empowering public libraries, transforming community learning

In Uganda the digital gap in education can disproportionately affect students living in rural areas, away from towns and cities where schools often already have access to the educational opportunities provided by the internet.

We support 14 public libraries across Uganda with ICT resources and free 4G internet so that learners of all ages can connect with educational resources. These libraries support primary and secondary schools and early childhood education centres, with teachers using the internet to deliver lessons and share study tools that many schools do not have access to.

The libraries also run courses in basic ICT training and in 2022/23, 564 students successfully completed the programme, which equips them with skills, including Microsoft Excel, Word, PowerPoint and internet research. The skills they learn support their own education, and we hope they will go on to inspire and engage others as they connect to the opportunities of the digital economy.

# Helping support mothers and babies at maternal health centres

We have a long track record of engaging with the community by supporting health programmes and medical centres through direct donations, and in April 2022 across Uganda we helped equip 13 maternity facilities and refurbished one maternal health centre.

In support of the Uganda Muslim Medical Bureau, we donated delivery beds, oxygen cylinders, oxygen regulators with humidifier bottles, and digital weighing scales for babies to 13 hospitals. In addition, 500 'Mama kits' and food items were given to expectant mothers in the health facilities. The donation was worth UGX70m (equivalent of $18,700).

Also, as part of our Airtel Cares programme: we fully refurbished the Kisaasi Church of Uganda (CoU) Health Center in a project costing UGX50m (equivalent of $13,500), to boost health service delivery in the community.

# Airtel Chad makes a donation to natural disaster victims

N'Djamena, Chad capital city, is located near the Chari River which has recorded its worst floods since 1962. Thousands of families were displaced, and three Airtel Chad infrastructure sites shut down and evacuated to preserve our equipment.

Michael Foley, regional director, Francophone Africa, visited the floods victims' camp on 12 November 2022 in N'Djamena, capital city of Chad, along the Chari River, which borders Cameroon and Chad, and presided over the donation of significant quantities of staple goods to the Ministry of Gender and Solidarity. The event had a big impact among the affected community and strengthened Airtel Chad's positive image for community support.

# Pillar 4 Our environment

For Airtel Africa, environmental protection is nonnegotiable. Our ambition is to address and minimise the impact of our operations on the environment. We are committed to a net zero future and protecting natural resources and Africa's precious biodiversity.

# Our greenhouse gas reduction goal

Our goal is to achieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions ahead of 2050

We plan to reduce our emissions through Groupwide rollout of a robust and credible emissions reduction strategy in both the near and longer term, and in partnership with our vendors and suppliers.

MATERIAL TOPIC: CLIMATE CHANGE

We are dedicated to our corporate purpose of transforming the lives of people on the African continent, and this is underpinned by our commitment to environmental protection.

We must ensure we do not contribute to the problem of climate change, but instead focus on reducing emissions associated with our operations and on protecting Africa's natural resources.

In October 2022, we published our scope 1, 2 and 3 baseline emissions in our inaugural Sustainability Report 2022. For scope 1 and 2, where we have control of the data, the activities and assets contributing to these emissions were identified and categorised, and organisational reporting boundaries were set and confirmed by The Carbon Trust, the expert consultancy, who are supporting us in the delivery of this goal. For scope 3, where we do not have direct control of the source or the data, we have worked with our partners and used published data to calculate baseline for our scope 3 carbon emissions. We will continue to collaborate with our partners and suppliers to refine data management and develop programmes and initiatives that will drive emissions down for the entire value chain. We will publish our total scope 3 emissions for 2022/23 once we have received and validated data from all our partners.

As soon as we published our baseline emissions last October, work started to examine a wide range of projects and initiatives that have the potential to reduce our GHG emissions. First, we engaged with the OpCos which have the highest level of emissions (accounting for  $>80\%$  of our total baseline) through a series of workshops to ascertain the practical implications of decarbonisation strategies, including investments. Secondly, we worked with the remaining OpCos which have the lowest level of emissions to address the most viable decarbonisation initiatives in their respective markets.

We established broad workstreams across the relevant functions to assess the feasibility of our scope 1 and 2 decarbonisation plans, and many of the potential initiatives are laid out in our Sustainability Report 2022. This work is led jointly by network and supply chain management who also oversee the carbon reduction initiatives which have already been rolled out in our operations.

In 2022/23, working with The Carbon Trust, we have developed a granular roadmap for decarbonisation across all 14 OpCos which required a comprehensive audit of all our assets. We also developed a proprietary framework to reflect our operational structure – this will guide the Group-wide rollout of our emissions reduction strategy in both the near and longer term. We're now undertaking additional feasibility studies for scope 1 and 2 emissions for all assets in the relevant markets.

We estimate that the initiatives identified by our analysis across our 14 OpCos and modelled by The Carbon Trust have the potential to reduce emissions intensity by over  $60\%$  against our baseline by 2032.

# Cutting greenhouse gases in partnership with ATC

We continue to explore new ways to increase usage of renewable energy in our operations. In October 2022, we reached a new multi-year, multi-product agreement with key supplier American Tower Corporation (ATC), who operates a network of infrastructure sites in Kenya, Niger, Nigeria and Uganda. Under the agreement, all new site developments, as we expand our network, will comply with ATC's new green site specifications which substantially reduce reliance on fossil fuels while shielding customers and operators from volatile fuel and diesel pricing. In December 2022, we unveiled our first 'green' tower in Uganda which is powered by 46 solar panels to reduce emissions, for the benefit of our customers and the planet. The rollout of 'green' towers will continue in 2023/24.

The agreement supports the advancement of carbon reduction plans for both Airtel Africa's and ATC's long-term sustainability goals, and is helping us ensure a brighter, greener, more sustainable future.

# Our sustainability strategy continued

# Next steps

Growth in demand for our products, services and data will require additional infrastructure – including towers, data and switching centres, and retail facilities. Therefore, we're now undertaking a significant analysis to understand the potential impact of this growth on our total emissions and emission intensity. This work is critical to ensure that digital and financial inclusion for millions of people in communities across Africa is balanced against our GHG emissions targets.

It is also vital that we focus on reducing our scope 3 emissions. Our scope 3 baseline numbers revealed that GHG emissions from our suppliers and vendors account for over  $80\%$  of our GHG footprint, so we are committed to taking a partnership approach with suppliers and vendors to address our scope 3 emissions. The process to establish a long-term collaboration methodology is already underway and an initial round of consultations took place with our ten most significant partners (by procurement expenditure) in Q4'23.

Once technical and detailed feasibility studies for scope 1 and 2 have been completed, we will update on the outcome of this work. We will also be formulating our scope 3 strategy – and the plans it will outline are a vital contribution to a net zero future. We are committed to the reduction of GHG emissions from our operations and will prioritise the provision of accurate and verified forecasts for emissions reduction.

# Carbon accounting policy

In addition to the work outlined above, over the past six months we have worked with The Carbon Trust to develop and publish a standalone document that sets out our approach and principles of carbon accounting. Our carbon accounting policy is based on the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol standards and the technical models for emission calculations. The policy details the way we approach calculation boundaries for carbon emissions and clearly sets out the number of assets where we have operational control, and which are included in the GHG emissions calculations. Our reporting period for carbon accounting is aligned with the financial year: from 1 April to 31 March. The policy commits Airtel Africa to an environmentally extended input/output data (EEOI) approach which bases scope 3 emissions on spend-based data multiplied by emissions factors. We will continue our work to improve data collection processes by engaging with our partners and suppliers and shift to the lifecycle assessment approach (LCA) to increase the accuracy of scope 3 emissions calculations.

# Partnerships in action

# Partnering with Ericsson to build a more efficient network in Niger

Developing our 5G capabilities is critical to ensuring – ready for future data demand – and can also help make us more energy efficient, as 5G networks offer significant energy savings compared to 3G and 4G.

In January 2023 we partnered with Ericsson to deploy their state-of-the-art dual-band three-sector Radio 6626 equipment in Niger. Tests on the Radio 6626 have demonstrated a reduction of more than  $60\%$  in power consumption and approx. 0.4 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per site per year, as well as  $60\%$  less weight on the tower.

# Our environmental stewardship goal

It is essential we reduce waste and conserve natural resources

Our goal is to eliminate hazardous waste from our operations, and significantly reduce our non-hazardous waste outputs. We also aim to minimise our water consumption.

We achieve this through the development and implementation of programmes designed to replace damaging materials, expand recycling schemes, and build employees' awareness around protection of natural resources.

MATERIAL TOPIC: CIRCULAR ECONOMY

# Creating a culture in which environmental protection is embedded in the heart of our business and minds of our employees.

Our focus areas:

- Elimination of hazardous waste from our operations – taking a responsible approach to reduce and dispose of hazardous waste.  
- Reducing non-hazardous waste – increasing reuse and recycling.  
- Protection of natural resources - preserving water resources through reduction in use and employee education.

In the six months since the publication of our Sustainability Report 2022, all 14 OpCos have been focused on programmes to deliver our environmental stewardship goal. In addition, significant work has gone into the establishment of an effective environmental and social management system (ESMS) which will standardise our environmental activities across the entire business.

First, we have increased the number of markets where waste is sorted and segregated. As of 31 March 2023, eight of our 14 markets have full waste separation in place, and we anticipate we will have established this in every market by fourth quarter of 2023/24. Secondly, responsible and safe disposal of e-waste is an important consideration for us. We have contracts with specialist and fully certified recycling organisations in place in each market to ensure our e-waste is disposed in a sustainable manner.

Energy efficiency is a key component of 'Project Green', a Group-wide initiative that we established to help achieve our environmental stewardship goal. Over the past six months, there has been a particular focus on our office buildings and facilities where we evaluate the best ways to reduce energy consumption. As a result, we have replaced incandescent lightbulbs with LED bulbs in more than  $90\%$  of our premises which, studies have shown, use  $75\%$  less energy than incandescent bulbs.

# Our environment in action

# Joining the movement to eliminate open waste-burning from Africa

We are committed to reducing and eliminating waste and conserving natural resources – and one of our goals is to eliminate hazardous waste from our operations, and significantly reduce our non-hazardous waste outputs.

Across our markets only around  $11\%$  of all waste is recycled – and the dumping and burning of waste is a serious issue. So in March 2023, we joined the multi-stakeholder partnership for eliminating open waste-burning from Africa to work on addressing the issue alongside other stakeholders, including local authorities, private companies, community groups, civil society and development partners. The initiative will also promote resource-efficient circularity: using waste as a secondary resource input for decent job creation. The initiative aims to reduce open waste-burning by  $60\%$  by 2030, and eliminate it from Africa by 2040, through changing public behaviour, introducing effective policy frameworks, and building sustainable infrastructure for waste management.

# Planting for the future: World Wetlands Day

Our sustainability strategy recognises the importance of biodiversity and ecosystems to our business and to those around us – and we aim to have a positive impact on the natural environment. So, in February 2023 we celebrated World Wetlands Day, to commemorate the vital wetland ecosystems which contribute to global biodiversity and support climate change mitigation and adaptation. As well as raising awareness among employees and communities across our markets, in Kenya we supported a programme to plant 2,000 seedlings of suitable indigenous trees in Enkongu Enkare in Narok County and helped erect fencing to protect the area. The wetland provides water for domestic use and for irrigating agricultural land, as well as supporting biodiversity.

# Environment and Social Management System (ESMS)

As a responsible business, we need a systematic approach to gathering information that helps us prevent or mitigate adverse environmental and social impacts from our operations, while also building the resilience of Airtel Africa and its infrastructure.

In 2022/23, we made important progress with the development of our environmental and social management system (ESMS), which is being rolled out across all our markets. The ESMS provides a framework designed to protect the wellbeing of employees and communities, and to help us respond to changing environmental and social conditions in the communities where we operate. It also influences the design of our products and services, the materials we use, and the way we interact with and audit our suppliers.

In January 2023, we engaged Kisasa ESG consultants to guide us in the process and develop training materials aimed at building the capacity of employees who will implement our ESMS. We will roll out capacity training in 2023/24.

Our ESMS covers all business activities. As well as our direct operations, it covers indirect operation by passive infrastructure service providers (such as telecommunications tower and fibre optic service providers), in accordance with IFC Performance Standards (IFC PS) Good International Industry Practice (GIIP) and applicable guidelines for telecommunication operations, as well as ISO 14001:2015 for environmental management systems. The ESMS includes:

- protecting the environment and society through the prevention or mitigation of adverse environmental and social impacts from our operations  
ensuring that as a company we comply with regulations and other requirements related to environmental and social performance  
- influencing the way we design our products and services, our processes, network rollout, distribution, and disposal by using a lifecycle perspective that can prevent environmental and social impacts from being unintentionally shifted elsewhere within the value chain  
- holding our suppliers and contractors to high standards of observing human and labour rights, environmental performance, and business ethics  
achieving financial and operational benefits that result from implementing environmentally sound and socially acceptable approaches that strengthen our organisation's position in the market.

In 2023/24, we'll be rolling out training and competency development to ensure that the ESMS policies and procedures are embedded across the Group.

# TCFD disclosures

# Airtel Africa is committed to transparency in our disclosure and reporting of all sustainability-related and climate-related risks and opportunities.

This is evidenced by the progress we have made this year in complying with the TCFD recommendations and recommended disclosures. We understand that this is a journey, and we are committed to continue to assess, on an ongoing basis, our risk management processes, climate actions and metrics to align with our business, climate risk and opportunities, and the expectations of our stakeholders.

This year, we have continued our work with The Carbon Trust on scenario analysis testing of our climate risks and opportunities and, relatedly, the feasibility assessment of our decarbonisation plans in line with our plans towards net zero carbon emissions. This follows from the gap assessment which was conducted last year and has resulted in significant improvement in the robustness of our climate response plans and the embedding of climate risk assessment within our business operations, risk management and strategic planning processes.

# Governance

Disclose the organisation's governance around climate-related risks and opportunities.

# Strategy

Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organisation's businesses, strategy and financial planning where such information is material.

# Risk management

Disclose how the organisation identifies, assesses and manages climate-related risks.

# Metrics and targets

Disclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant climate-related risks and opportunities where such information is material.

# Our pathway to TCFD-aligned reporting

This year, the second year in our TCFD reporting journey, we have made significant progress to our climate risk assessment and reporting process. Progress update on planned actions disclosed in last year's report is outlined below:

# Governance

# Describe the Board's oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities

The Board has overall responsibility for the management of our climate-related risks and opportunities (CROs). Our Board maintains this oversight through two of its committees – the Audit and Risk Committee (ARC) and the Sustainability Committee. The Audit and Risk Committee oversees our risk management processes, including the assessment and mitigation of CROs (see pages 117-127 for details of our ARC meetings and the frequency of meetings in the year). The Sustainability Committee meets monthly and is responsible for implementing our sustainability strategy, including the climate response actions addressed within the environment pillar of the strategy. The Sustainability Committee oversees the overall implementation of the company sustainability strategy, including strategic initiatives, budget requirements, and review the development of performance objectives to track the achievement of both short- and long-term goals. Our CEO currently chairs the Sustainability Committee and attends every Audit and Risk Committee and the Executive Risk Committee (ERC) meetings. He provides a direct link to the management of CROs as does our Board sustainability champion, Annika Poutiainen, who also attends Board, Audit and Risk Committee and Sustainability Committee meetings. Annika reports to the Board on the work of the Sustainability Committee and, together with the CEO, supported by relevant members of the management team, will seek approval for any actions.

# Describe management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities

Through the ERC, management oversees our risk management processes, including the assessment and development of mitigation actions for CROs. The ERC meets on a quarterly basis. Our Executive Committee (ExCo) ensures that climate actions are integrated into our operational business strategy. The two components of our strategy towards CROs are reduction of GHG emissions and environmental stewardship. In light of this two-pronged approach, our chief technology and information officer and chief supply chain officer jointly lead 'Our environment' pillar of the sustainability strategy.

Our materiality assessment shows that energy use from the data centres, network operating centres and infrastructure sites constitute a large percentage of the total energy consumption within our business. So, our chief technology and information officer oversees the strategy to bring energy-efficient initiatives into our core operational processes. Furthermore, a significant number (92%) of our infrastructure sites are owned by tower companies (towercos) and we lease space from them. Our chief supply chain officer leads our efforts to generate climate action from the towerco partners to achieve energy efficiency and reduce GHG emissions.

Our head of strategy and sustainability leads our climate-related programmes and ensures a seamless integration between our business strategy and climate response actions. The head of strategy and sustainability reports to the CEO who chairs the Sustainability Committee.

# Strategy: risk and opportunities

Following the work on our climate scenario analysis this year, the list of climate risks and opportunities has been further refined to align with our business model and the geographical spread of our operations. In assessing our climate risks and opportunities, we have taken a disaggregated approach. Whereas some physical risks apply to all our markets, there are certain climate risks that are peculiar to specific countries. For instance, the risks of tropical storms and cyclones are localised to Madagascar and Malawi within our country portfolio while the risk of extreme temperature increases, which are negatively impacting cooling costs, are more significant for countries located in arid regions such as Chad, Niger and parts of Northern Nigeria. These factors have been built into our modelling process to ensure we get a credible assessment of our most significant climate risks to be prioritised for the attention of our executive management and the Board.

# Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organisation's businesses, strategy and financial planning.

Our 'Win with' strategy now incorporates sustainability as a key enabler of each of the strategic pillars. This reflects our ambition to deliver profitable growth in the long term by integrating sustainability into the core of our business strategy (see pages 26-37). 'Our environment' pillar, encompassing climate risks and opportunities, is one of the four pillars of our sustainability strategy. This highlights our focus on environmental stewardship and our ambition to achieve net zero emissions within our operations. See pages 38-55 for more information about our sustainability strategy.

Our strategic and financial planning processes are closely aligned with our sustainability strategy and our ambition to achieve net zero emissions across our operations. Specifically, this financial year, we have seen an acceleration of this integration between our strategic plans and climate response actions due to significant fuel price inflation in some of our markets which put a strain on our operating costs. This has allowed us to take significant steps to accelerate our transition planning to renewable energy sources in collaboration with our towerco partners as part of our risk mitigation plans and strategic response to this risk. This example shows that our climate action plan and strategic planning processes are not separate processes but an integrated approach to do what is best for our business, our stakeholders, and the environment.

In parallel, we actively participate in industry initiatives, such as the GSMA's Climate Action Taskforce and the biodiversity subgroup which we co-lead to work with industry peers and find common solutions to address the climate crisis. We've started an industry-leading approach to meet the challenges of creating a credible carbon reduction plan. Our aim is to find and agree a common industry approach to ensure credible long-term decarbonisation plans and targets.

# Describe the resilience of the organisation's strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a  $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  or lower scenario.

This year, we conducted a scenario analysis exercise to assess the resilience of our business in the light of the climate risks and opportunities we are faced with.

The scenario testing was done under three scenarios:

1. Current policies scenario – global temperature at c.  $3^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  (no climate action)  
2. High temperature scenario - global temperature greater than c.  $3^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$  (extreme case)  
3. Net zero Paris Agreement aligned scenario – global temperature at c.  $1.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  (transition to net zero).

These scenarios were selected to assess the resilience of the business under current policies without any transition to net zero, impact of a transition to net zero and the extreme case of a high temperature scenario on our business operations and physical assets.

This extensive analysis started with the identification of CROs inherent in our business model, value chain and geographical footprint. These climate risks and opportunities were then assessed for likelihood, velocity, and financial materiality. The scenario-testing was principally quantitative based with  $81\%$  of our CROs assessed using quantitative data from externally-accessed climate datasets. For the balanced CROs, we opted for qualitative assessment using likelihood and velocity.

The result of the scenario analysis shows that:

1. The most significant transition risks for our business are direct carbon prices on our leased assets and network equipment as these would have the impact of increasing our operating costs and the potential introduction of carbon taxes in various countries  
2. The key physical risks relate to increase in river and coastal flooding in our operating markets with the potential to disrupt operations, damage physical infrastructure and negatively impact revenues, increase in air temperature resulting in increased cooling requirements and, consequently, higher energy costs, and extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones in two of our markets (Madagascar and Malawi)  
3. Finally, our most significant climate opportunities will result from increased market valuation from early transition to net zero, access to green financing opportunities, and improved cost efficiency from the adoption of energy efficient methods and environmentally friendly business processes.

The output of the scenario modelling shows that the Group stands to benefit from an early transition to net zero through enhanced market valuation and access to better 'green' financing options, and should take every necessary step to mitigate the risks of extreme weather events on its physical assets to prevent business disruptions which could negatively impact our future revenues and profitability. The outcome of the scenario analysis further justifies the company's strategy to achieve net zero by 2050.

# Describe the organisation's processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks.

We have a robust enterprise risk management process which is uniformly implemented across all our operating subsidiaries. Our process for identifying and assessing climate-related risks follows our established risk management framework. The classification of climate risk has been completed using the TCFD's recommendations around physical and transition risks. See page 61 for details of our enterprise risk management framework.

As climate change has been recognised by the Board as an emerging risk, this receives the ongoing attention of the Sustainability Committee and the Audit and Risk Committee as part of our risk review process. We mitigate physical climate risks through our business continuity management processes, as well as the current initiatives to address transition risks detailed within the environment pillar of our sustainability strategy. See pages 38-55 for details of our sustainability strategy.

# Describe the organisation's processes for managing climate-related risks.

The Group Executive Risk Committee (ERC) assesses and mitigates climate-related risks, with oversight by the Board through the Audit and Risk Committee and the Sustainability Committee. The Sustainability Committee directly oversees the implementation of our sustainability strategy, including climate-related actions and programmes related to our environmental objectives and meets monthly.

Our head of strategy and sustainability is primarily responsible for the design and implementation of our climate response actions. For a detailed overview of our risk management process and framework, see page 91.

# Describe how processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the organisation's overall risk management.

The process of identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks follows our existing enterprise risk management framework. Our framework allows for a uniform approach across the Group for risk identification, assessment and prioritisation. Specifically, in relation to climate-related risks, we have further assessed identified risks, based on likelihood, velocity and potential financial impact using both qualitative and externally available quantitative data sets as part of our scenario analysis to determine the resilience of the business and the prioritisation of the risks.

We have identified appropriate quantitative metrics for measuring and tracking the impact of climate of our operations and we will continue to review and identify other suitable metrics to be used to reliably assess and measure our climate risks and opportunities on an ongoing basis.

# The climate-related financial disclosures contained in this report are consistent with the TCFD recommendations and recommended disclosures and the 'Guidance for All Sectors' as contained in section C of the TCFD Annex, except for metrics and targets (b) with respect to disclosure of scope 3 emissions.

Since the launch of our sustainability strategy, we have set out to reliably measure and report carbon emissions within our business and value chain. The outcome of this work resulted in the publishing of our scope 1, 2 and 3 baseline data in our inaugural Sustainability Report in 2022. In preparing this report, we have not published updated scope 3 emissions data as we are engaging with our towerco partners to ensure the robustness and completeness of our scope 3 emissions data. We expect that the outcome of this engagement will ensure that we can reliably publish our scope 3 emissions data in future reporting.

# Metrics and targets

# Disclose the metrics used by the organisation to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management process.

We use the following metrics to measure and assess the impact of climate-related risks (CROs) and opportunities on our business. We will continue to assess the suitability of additional metrics that can be reliably measured for a more robust assessment of our climate risks and opportunities.

Our business model does not principally involve the use of water and/or land resources and no metrics have been selected with respect to water and land use as these are immaterial to our business.

<table><tr><td>Metrics</td><td>Measure</td></tr><tr><td>Scope 1 emissions</td><td>tCO2e</td></tr><tr><td>Scope 2 emissions</td><td>tCO2e</td></tr><tr><td>Total energy consumption</td><td>kWh</td></tr><tr><td>Carbon intensity</td><td>tCO2e per MW</td></tr></table>

# Disclose scope 1, 2 and, if appropriate, scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the related risks.

Since the launch of our sustainability strategy in October 2021, we have been focused on understanding our scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. From the beginning of 2022, we have worked closely with The Carbon Trust, the leading global environmental consultancy, to develop detailed scope 1 and 2 modelling for calculating our GHG emissions across all our operating footprint and value chain. We are engaging with our towercos partners for an accurate assessment of our 2022/23 scope 3 emissions. We will keep our stakeholders updated on the progress of this work. Our baseline data for scope 3 was disclosed in our Sustainability Report 2022.

<table><tr><td></td><td>Measure</td><td>Baseline data (2021/22)</td><td>Current year (2022/23)</td></tr><tr><td>Scope 1 emissions</td><td>tCO2e</td><td>65,180</td><td>67,266</td></tr><tr><td>Scope 2 emissions</td><td>tCO2e</td><td>50,539</td><td>47,577</td></tr></table>

# Describe the targets used by the organisation to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against targets.

We are committed to achieving our net zero ambition by 2050 as was disclosed in our sustainability strategy. This commitment has led to the integration of our long-term planning process in our sustainability strategy to ensure the delivery of our sustainability objective as we deliver on our business objectives. This is reflected for instance in our capital expenditure planning process where our commitment towards renewable energy transition is a key driver in the planning for new sites' rollout and contract negotiations with our towerco partners as are other considerations such as cost efficiency in the face of increased fuel price inflation. This integration of our strategic planning process and sustainability strategy is at the centre of our climate response plan to ensure we can deliver on our commitment to transition to net zero within our operations by 2050.

We have conducted an extensive feasibility study of our decarbonisation interventions and have a near-term target to reduce our carbon intensity by  $62\%$  and absolute emissions from our existing assets (before accounting for future business growth and network expansion) by  $54\%$  by 2032. We have taken a near-term target of 2032 which is 10 years from our baseline of 2022 which is in line with the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi).

We have identified specific KPIs which allow us to measure our performance and we will continue to evaluate the identification of other suitable KPIs which are most aligned to our climate risks and opportunities.

Members of our ExCo are financially incentivised to reduce our carbon footprint, and our incentive plan includes performance against achievement of the CROs as part of our broader sustainability strategy. The incentives are linked to the delivery of sustainability strategy which cuts across four pillars and nine dedicated workstreams, among them, reduction of GHG emissions and environmental stewardship. These incentives are linked to the key result areas (KRAs) and the long-term incentive plan (LTIP) of our ExCo members as part of the annual performance evaluation process. The incentive plan is designed to ensure continued focus and delivery of year-on-year tactical plans which are important for the delivery of our long-term climate commitments.

# Markets and performance

The significant growth in our mobile money business has meant we've evolved our organisational structure.

This has led to changes in the information used by our CEO (who is the chief operating decision-maker) for the allocation of resources and the assessment of performance. This, in turn, means we're changing how we report performance.

From April 2022, we report on mobile money as a new operating and reportable segment, while continuing to report segmental performance for mobile services in Nigeria, East Africa and Francophone Africa.

1 Mobile service revenue after inter-segment eliminations was  $4,715m in year ended 31 March 2023 and$ 4,290m in the prior year.

# Overview

We've been at the forefront of the rapid growth of mobile services in sub-Saharan Africa in recent years – but there is still much further to go in order to meet demand in a region that, while growing fast, is still under-connected. Only  $40\%$  of the adult population has access to mobile data, and the usage gap among those who are covered by networks is almost  $44\%$ . That means demand for mobile services in all our markets remains strong. We aim to meet it by connecting more people, offering transparent voice and data products that meet their needs, and expanding our physical and digital distribution networks so that more customers can access our services effectively and affordably.

Our customer base grew by  $9.0\%$  to 140 million in 2022/23, and revenues grew by  $16.2\%$ , despite a year in which turbulence in the global economy was expressed in our markets through a series of headwinds, including cost-of-living pressures for our customers and communities. Inflation in fuel and food prices meant that many customers became even more price conscious. We've always taken the approach of seeking revenue from increased usage, rather than prices, so we continued to offer 'more for more'. The rate of smartphone adoption slowed in some markets as the cost of living had an impact on discretionary spend – but usage of all our services increased, reflecting the fact that they are increasingly seen as essential services by users.

Our success in mobile services is built on the strength of our network and the excellence of our distribution. We invested strategically in our network in 2022/23, significantly expanding our 4G network, modernising many of our sites, and launching 5G in selected markets in readiness for future demand. At the same time, we continued to refine and expand our distribution footprint, increasing our exclusive outlets by  $15.3\%$  to  $79,500+$ .

Our voice ARPU grew by  $2.1\%$  compared to 2021/22, and overall our mobile voice business line – which includes pre- and post-paid wireless voice services, international roaming, fixed-line phone services and interconnect revenue – contributed  $89.8\%$  to Airtel Africa's consolidated revenue in 2022/23. The big opportunity for the future, however, is data – which is why we have continued to consolidate our leadership positions in 4G in most markets, supporting the digital inclusion ambitions of our sustainability strategy while setting the foundations for our continued growth.

# Our performance

Overall mobile services revenue increased to \(4,721m, up by 9.9% in reported currency, while growth in constant currency was 16.2%. Revenue growth was recorded across all regions and key services: Nigeria up by 20.3%, East Africa by 13.4% and Francophone Africa by 11.9%.

Voice revenue grew by  $11.8\%$  in constant currency, driven by both customer base growth of  $9.0\%$  and voice ARPU growth of  $2.1\%$ . Revenue growth for the first half of the year was slightly impacted by the effect of barring outgoing calls in Nigeria for those customers who had not submitted their National Identity Numbers ('NINs'). We continue to invest in our network to increase coverage, while also expanding our distribution infrastructure to drive further customer base growth.

Our continued expansion of network and distribution infrastructure helped drive customer additions. Voice usage per customer increased by  $5.9\%$ , resulting in voice ARPU growth of  $2.1\%$ . Voice usage per customer increased to 272 minutes per customer per month from 257 minutes per customer per month, and total minutes on the network increased by  $16.0\%$ .

Data revenue grew by  $23.8\%$  in constant currency, driven by strong growth in customer base of  $16.9\%$  and data ARPU growth of  $9.3\%$ . Revenue growth was recorded across all regions: Nigeria grew by  $27.8\%$ , East Africa by  $22.8\%$  and Francophone Africa by  $16.2\%$ , respectively. Data customer base growth of  $16.9\%$  resulted from the further expansion of our 4G network with  $90.3\%$  of total sites on 4G, up from  $87.6\%$  (almost  $100\%$  of sites in six OpCos are now on 4G). Total customers reached 54.6 million with 4G customers of 26.5 million, contributing to  $48.5\%$  of the total data customer base. Data usage per customer increased by  $29.1\%$  driving data ARPU growth of  $9.3\%$ . Data usage per customer reached 4.4 GB per customer per month up from 3.4 GB per customer per month in the prior period. Q4'23 data usage per customer increased to 4.6 GB per month (up by  $26.6\%$ ) and 4G data usage per customer at 7.6 GB per month from 5.9 GB per customer per month (up by  $29.6\%$ ).

Mobile services underlying EBITDA was \(2,329m, and grew by 14.9% in constant currency with an underlying EBITDA margin of 49.3%, declining 57 basis points in constant currency. The reduction in underlying EBITDA margin was due to an increase in operating costs in Nigeria reflecting energy price inflation.

Operating free cash flow was \(1,629m, up by 15.8%, due to the expansion of underlying EBITDA partially offset by higher capex.

# Overview

We're very close to our customers in Nigeria, our largest single country market, where a young and growing population has a huge appetite for fast, affordable data and reliable mobile services. Nigeria's dynamic economy gains much of its energy from digital entrepreneurship – and we aim to partner the country and our customers as they drive digital transformation and economic empowerment.

We're investing in that digital future. We've created 1,000+ km more fibre infrastructure this year, with a focus on the major cities of Lagos, Kano, Abuja and Enugu. We're ensuring greater network reliability to give customers a consistent experience and expanding our distribution network to reach more people in remote, underserved areas. And in December 2022, Airtel Nigeria bought additional 5G spectrum at auction for \(285m so that are ready for future 5G demand, while we continued to expand our 4G footprint to \(76.7\%\), to reach more communities.

Meeting Nigeria's National Identity Number (NIN) regulations has continued to be an important business requirement in 2022/23. While the government's barring of people who had not registered their NINs slowed growth and revenues at times during the year, we've been proactive in conducting awareness campaigns, setting up NIN registration facilities and increasing the number of our KYC centres, while creating offers for NIN re-registration. Similarly, we've weathered the significant pressures of a year in which fuel prices rose sharply, elections dominated the political agenda, and devaluation and currency shortages drove up underlying costs.

Despite these headwinds, the resilient performance of our teams on the ground has meant this has been another year of growth, with our customer base growing by  $9.0\%$ , and revenues by  $20.3\%$ .

# Our performance

In reported currency, Nigeria revenue grew by  $13.3\%$  to  $\$2,128\mathrm{m}$  and  $20.3\%$  in constant currency. Strong growth in both voice and data contributed to revenue growth, driven mainly by overall customer base growth of  $9.0\%$  and data customer base growth of  $17.3\%$ . ARPU grew by  $7.0\%$ , largely driven by higher data and other revenue. Q4'23 revenue growth at  $18.7\%$  was lower compared to  $23.1\%$  in Q3'23 mainly due to a shortage of cash in the country as a result of the demonetisation initiative, which impacted our cash recharges (50% of total recharges are cash based).

Voice revenue increased by  $13.4\%$  in constant currency, largely driven by customer base growth of  $9.0\%$  supported by voice ARPU growth of  $0.9\%$ . The barring of outgoing calls for customers who had not submitted their NINs had an adverse impact on voice revenue. A total of 13.6 million customers were originally barred, out of which 6.4 million customers  $(47\%)$  have subsequently submitted their NINs and 3.5 million customers  $(26\%)$  have been fully verified and unbarred. We estimate that this resulted in the loss of approximately $110m of revenues in year ended 31 March 2023, providing a drag on revenue growth of  $6\%$  in Nigeria.

Data revenue increased by  $27.8\%$  in constant currency, driven by both data customer base growth of  $17.3\%$  and data ARPU growth of  $9.9\%$ . Over the last year, we have enhanced our 4G network with ample data network capacity to provide high-speed data to our customers with almost  $100\%$  of our sites now on 4G and data capacity increase of  $27.5\%$ . This has contributed to 4G data customer growth of  $27.6\%$ . Data usage per customer increased by  $24.8\%$  facilitating continued data ARPU growth. Data usage per customer reached 5 GB per customer per month from 4 GB per customer per month in the previous period. In Q4'23, 4G data usage per customer increased to 9.5 GB per month (up by  $46.5\%$ ) from 6.5 GB per customer per month in the prior period. 4G data usage now contributes to  $80.4\%$  of total data usage on our network.

Other revenues grew by  $27.5\%$  in constant currency, with the main contribution coming from the growth in value added services revenue, led by airtime credit services.

Nigeria mobile services EBITDA was \(1,099m, up by 11.8% in constant currency. The EBITDA margin declined to 51.6% from 55.5% due to an increase in operating costs arising from inflationary pressures, particularly related to the fuel costs. The EBITDA margin in Q4'23 stabilised at 52.3% from 52.1% in Q3'23.

Operating free cash flow was \(806m, up by 10.0%, due to the expansion of EBITDA partially offset by higher capex spend in current period.

# Using satellite technology to keep isolated customers connected in Nigeria

Our customers rely on a stable, functioning network to keep connected - especially when times are challenging. In some rural parts of Borno State in northeast Nigeria, the telecommunications infrastructure has been damaged during the insurgency in the region, cutting access to services for people there when they need it most - including the region's many internally-displaced persons (IDPs).

In 2022, we deployed satellite technology to reconnect the towns of Banki, Buratai, Baga, Cross, Damasak, Monguno, Dikwa and Ngala in Borno State, and began integrating these satellite sites on microwave technology in Dikwa, Ngala and Gamboru. At the same time, we expanded our distribution network, adding a further  $60+$  outlets.

Customers are now able to connect within and between towns, and access services such as banking and healthcare - critically important for residents and IDPs. The initiative has also reached a monthly revenue of $200,000+ in March 2023.

# Overview

Our six markets in East Africa host some of the strongest economies in Africa, with regional GDP growth reaching  $4.8\%$  this year despite macroeconomic disruption in the global economy. There are 221 million people in our region, and for that relatively young population our products and services are a gateway to financial and digital opportunity.

Our aim is to unlock commercial and digital benefits for all our customers, their communities, and our business. In a year when inflation has put pressure on every customer's budget, we've offered more value to our customers through 'more-for-more' product offerings. At the same time, we've engaged regulators in each of our markets to enable more competitive pricing, so that our customers' greater usage has seen us increase revenues in voice and data.

We have continued to improve our network, simplify our products and increase customer touchpoints for our services. Our population coverage now stands at  $90.3\%$ , and we've added 1,400+ 4G sites in the past year while modernising additional sites so we can offer better connectivity and faster speeds for our customers. Fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) and fibre-to-the-business (FTTB) has also expanded, while we continue to benefit from increased home broadband and enterprise custom. We've also invested in 5G spectrum in four markets, to ensure we are ready for the additional demand for data we see ahead.

Meeting local regulatory requirements is an essential part of our business, and this year we adopted new KYC regulations in Kenya, Tanzania and Zambia, all requiring identification documents to register SIM cards. We rapidly updated our onboarding and KYC processes to minimise lost revenues from barred customers.

Distribution remains a crucial competitive advantage, and we ended 2022/23 with  $179,400+$  activating outlets, which is an increase by  $22.3\%$  since last year.

# Our performance

In East Africa, mobile services revenue grew by  $8.1\%$  in reported currency, and  $13.4\%$  in constant currency. The differential in growth rates was due to average currency devaluation of the Kenyan shilling, Ugandan shilling and Malawian kwacha, partially offset by an appreciation in the Zambian kwacha. Current year was impacted by the loss of tower sharing revenues (c.  $\$21m$ ) following the sales of towers in Tanzania and Malawi which is reflected in the  $7.8\%$  decline in other revenues over the period. Revenue growth, excluding the site sharing revenue impact of tower sales, was  $15.2\%$  for the period.

Voice revenue grew by  $12.2\%$  in constant currency, driven by both customer base growth of  $9.7\%$  and voice ARPU growth of  $4.1\%$ . The customer base growth of  $9.7\%$  was supported by the expansion of our network, enhanced coverage, and distribution infrastructure. Site count increased by  $9.2\%$  and activating outlets increased by  $22.3\%$ . Voice usage per customer increased by  $10.0\%$  to 384 minutes per customer per month resulting in voice ARPU growth of  $4.1\%$ . Total minutes on the network increased by  $18.5\%$  to 279.0 billion minutes.

Data revenue grew by  $22.8\%$  in constant currency, largely driven by both data customer base growth of  $19.9\%$  and data ARPU growth of  $9.2\%$ . The expansion of our 4G network and ample data network capacity helped us to grow both the data customer base and data usage.  $90.4\%$  of our total sites in East Africa are on 4G as compared with  $85.9\%$  in prior period.  $47.3\%$  of our total data customer base is on 4G which contributes to  $70.9\%$  of total data usage (in Q4'23). Data usage per customer increased by  $28.3\%$ , resulting in data ARPU growth of  $9.2\%$ , and data usage per customer reached 4.2 GB per customer per month from 3.3 GB per customer per month. In Q4'23, 4G data usage per customer increased to 6.5 GB per month from 5.5 GB per customer per month (up by  $18.4\%$  from the prior period).

Mobile services underlying EBITDA increased to \(753m, up 17.5% in constant currency. Underlying EBITDA margin improved to 49.9%, an improvement of 174 basis points in constant currency, as a result of revenue growth and improved operating efficiencies.

Operating free cash flow was \(497m, up by 29.2% in constant currency, largely due to expansion of underlying EBITDA.

# Overcoming challenging times to provide essential services in Malawi

Customers and businesses in Malawi faced a range of challenges in 2022/23 – and we responded by finding new ways of working to maintain essential telecoms services. Protracted power failures and a country-wide fuel shortage meant that many telecommunication towers were unable to operate for significant periods – while communities also had to tackle the impact of cyclones Gombe and Anna, sharp currency devaluations, foreign exchange shortages, and inflation.

We formed a new partnership with our towerco, Helios Towers, and engaged with the Malawi Energy Regulatory Authority and Reserve Bank to ensure our services were maintained. In addition, in 2022/23 we invested around $15m in our network despite the shortage of foreign currency in Malawi.

Maintaining our services helped us meet the demand for data, which grew by  $125\%$  in 2022/23, and gave customers access to mobile money services.

"Customers and regulators recognise us as an essential service, especially when times are difficult – so keeping our network running this year meant we could keep connecting communities and businesses and enabling financial inclusion."

# Overview

Our Francophone Africa segment is made up of Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Madagascar, Niger, Republic of the Congo and the Seychelles – and it is home to more than 181 million people. The region has a median age of  $16^{\star}$ , and landline infrastructure is scarce – which means that mobile services are the first and often only way that millions of people can connect with each other and the wider economy.

This creates a huge demand for data and voice services. This year usage across all segments continued to grow, alongside our customer base. Data usage, in particular, is growing fast, highlighting the continuing appetite for internet access. We've invested in urban fibre in cities such as Kinshasa, Niamey and N'Djamena, and in network expansion across all markets. In DRC we invested in additional spectrum, and in Chad, in a first for the region, we built a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna in N'Djamena. This investment across the region was primarily driven by the need to meet demand for data – and data usage grew by  $57.8\%$  in 2022/23.

Our resilient performance this year is a credit to the work of our teams, who have faced significant challenges in several markets as price inflation, fuel shortages and lack of security have disrupted the economy and made life difficult for many in the communities we serve. A number of markets have also experienced severe weather events linked to climate change, with Chad, the DRC and Niger, in particular, suffering floods that saw many thousands of people displaced – situations in which we have made enormous efforts to maintain essential mobile services.

Despite these headwinds, we've welcomed 0.8 million new data customers, and grown our overall customer base by  $7.8\%$ , connecting more people and communities than ever before.

# Our performance

In Francophone Africa, mobile services revenue grew by  $5.5\%$  in reported currency and by  $11.9\%$  in constant currency. The differential in growth rates was driven primarily by the  $11.7\%$  devaluation of the Central African franc.

Voice revenue increased by  $8.8\%$  in constant currency, mainly driven by customer base growth of  $7.8\%$ . With continued investments in network expansion and distribution infrastructure, total sites increased by  $9.2\%$  and activating outlets increased by  $12\%$  (exclusive outlets increased by  $20\%$ ). Voice usage per customer grew by  $10.1\%$  to 150 minutes per customer per month, thereby resulting in a  $19.5\%$  growth in total voice minutes on our network.

Data revenue increased by  $16.2\%$  in constant currency, driven by both customer base growth of  $9.4\%$  and data ARPU growth of  $7.8\%$ . We continue to expand our 4G network, with  $69.0\%$  of our sites in Francophone Africa on 4G (up from  $65.3\%$  in prior period) and data capacity on our network increased by  $60.5\%$ . Total data usage increased by  $57.8\%$ , primarily driven by an increase in data usage per customer by  $46.3\%$  to 3.5 GB per customer per month compared with 2.4 GB in the prior period. As of Q4'23,  $54\%$  of the data customer base is on 4G, contributing to  $72.4\%$  of total data usage. Q4'23 4G data usage per customer increased to 5.6 GB per month (up by  $18.4\%$ ) compared with 4.7 GB per customer per month.

Mobile services EBITDA at  $476m, increased by 18.2% in constant currency. EBITDA margin improved to 43.7%, an improvement of 236 basis points in constant currency. However, the current year had a one-time opex benefit of approximately$ 19m in the first half, resulting in a normalized EBITDA margin for 2022/23 of 42.0% – an improvement of 68 basis points in constant currency.

Operating free cash flow was \(325m, increased by 12.7%, driven by the expansion in EBITDA and partially offset by higher capex.

# Deploying 'Massive MIMO' technology to improve our network in Chad

Rapidly increasing demand for voice and data services can put pressure on any telecoms network - especially in towns and cities with a high concentration of customers.

This year, we explored an innovative approach to improving our customers' service: by deploying 'Massive MIMO' technology to N'Djamena, the capital city of Chad. 'MIMO' stands for 'multiple inputs, multiple outputs', and describes an antennae technology that can help improve download speeds. Our deployment in 22 sites in Chad in October 2022 was the first use of Massive MIMO in our operations which has had rapid results: data traffic on these sites increased by  $44\%$  and capacity almost doubled.

We've also seen a quick response from customers, who are now better connected than ever to each other, and to the digital economy.

1 Mobile money consolidates the results of mobile money operations from all operating entities within the Group. Airtel Money Commerce B.V. (AMC B.V.) is the holding company for all mobile money services for the Group, and as of 31 March 2023, it consolidates mobile money operations from 11 OpCos, currently excluding operations in Nigeria, Republic of the Congo and Tanzania. It is our management's intention to continue work to transfer all these remaining mobile money operations into AMC B.V., subject to local regulatory requirements.  
2 Mobile money service revenue post inter-segment eliminations with mobile services was  $540m in the year ended 31 March 2023, and$ 424m in the prior year.

# Overview

Across the region, mobile money is an increasingly important driver of economic growth. This trajectory will continue: economies are becoming increasingly cashless, consumers are embracing new financial behaviours, and businesses of all sizes are finding it cheaper, faster and more convenient to use mobile money services, whether that's to conduct regular small transactions or to make bulk payments direct to their employees or customers' mobile money wallets. And among the many under-banked or un-banked people in our markets, mobile money is creating access to basic financial services that would otherwise be unavailable to them, and rapidly increasing financial inclusion.

This year has seen excellent results for Airtel Money: we have widened our customer base and driven increased revenues. We see significant further opportunity ahead, and we have invested in our people and technology in order to meet it, as well as expanding our distribution network and float availability through our Airtel Money branches (AMBs) which expanded by  $11.5\%$  in 2022/23, and our kiosks, which increased by  $10.8\%$ .

Following the award of our Payment Service Bank (PSB) licence in Nigeria in April 2022, we are now able to offer digital wallets and bank accounts to customers in one of Africa's largest markets through their mobile phones. We have rapidly established a network of more than 52,000 agents in Nigeria, so we can start reaching customers and including more people in our mobile money eco-system, while building relationships with businesses and setting up our IT platforms to ensure we offer a stable, reliable service. We have also launched an information campaign to explain mobile money to potential customers in a country where there is significant scope for greater financial inclusion – more than 60 million Nigerians remain unbanked.

Elsewhere, we're expanding the scope of our services and creating increased 'use cases'. In Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia, for example, we've launched a new micro-merchant programme to bring more small and informal businesses into the mobile money economy. Our aim is to reach more than one million micro-merchants in the region in 2023/24. We're working on interoperability in several markets, which gives customers more access to financial services across borders. And across the region as a whole, we're continuing to expand our offering of mobile wallet deposits and withdrawals, merchant payments, enterprise disbursements, international money transfers, and loans and savings.

# Our performance

Mobile money revenue of \(692m increased by 25.1% in reported currency and by 29.6% in constant currency. The constant currency growth was partially offset by average currency devaluations, mainly in the Central African franc (11.7%), the Ugandan shilling (4.9%) and the Malawian kwacha (22.6%), in turn partially offset by the appreciation in the Zambian kwacha (8.8%). Revenue growth of 29.6% was driven by both East Africa (up 32.6%) and Francophone Africa (up 20.3%). In Nigeria, mobile money services (SmartCash) was launched in June 2022. Our focus in the period has been to invest in the platform technology as well as the business systems and processes to ensure confidence and reliability in the platform. In addition, our continued investment into the agent network continues to gain traction, driving encouraging progress on customer acquisition over the last quarter.

Constant currency revenue growth of  $29.6\%$  was largely led by customer base growth of  $20.4\%$ . The continued investment in distribution infrastructure of exclusive channels of Airtel Money branches and kiosks, as well as the expansion of mobile money agents, helped us in driving strong customer growth.

The mobile money customer base reached 31.5 million, an increase of  $20.4\%$ , and mobile money customer base penetration reached  $22.5\%$ , an increase of 2.1 percentage points. The expansion of distribution enhanced transaction value per customer by  $16.4\%$ , resulting in mobile money ARPU growth of  $6.8\%$ . Mobile money ARPU growth

was largely driven by an increase in transaction values and higher contributions from cash transactions, merchant payments and mobile service recharges through Airtel Money.

Our mobile money transaction value grew by  $41.3\%$  and Q4'23 annualised transaction value crossed  $\$ 102bn$ in constant currency. Q4'23 transaction value per customer reached  $\$ 260$ per month, an increase of  $26.1\%$  in constant currency. Mobile money revenue now accounts for  $13.2\%$  of total Group revenue for the year.

Mobile money EBITDA increased to \(344m, up by 26.4% in constant currency. The drop in mobile money EBITDA margin was largely due to additional spend in Nigeria PSB related to the launch of SmartCash.

# Mobile money interoperability in Tanzania and Zambia

In February 2022, the Bank of Tanzania, a regulatory authority, launched the instant payments switch (TIPS) system to enhance interoperability, boost financial inclusion and further deepen the digitalisation of payments in the country. This was an industry-wide regulatory initiative aimed at integrating mobile money platforms and banks in the country. Prior to the launch, customers and businesses were often charged substantial fees to transfer money between different providers. In October 2022, Airtel Tanzania was integrated into TIPS offering customers more ways to transfer money seamlessly between different providers, buy goods or pay bills regardless of which mobile money platform they use.

Also, in 2022 we integrated our Zambia mobile money services into the national financial switch (NFS) launched by the Bank of Zambia to improve interoperability between the banks and mobile network operators. Customers can now send funds directly to banks from their Airtel Money wallets and vice versa as well as make transfers regardless of their mobile money providers. The NFS system includes 19 banks in Zambia.

As of 31 March 2023, in Tanzania our mobile money transaction value processed through the national switch system was  $2.5bn and in Zambia -$ 3bn, respectively. In addition, as a result of these integrations, competition has increased in the mobile money market and made transactions more cost-effective for our customers.

# Empowering entrepreneurs, and supporting the organisations that drive Africa's growth

# Our market

Flourishing enterprises are at the heart of Africa's growth – and Airtel Business exists to provide them with the dynamic, reliable communications they need to drive economic opportunity. We're aiming to be the service provider of choice for fibre, fixed wireless broadband and satellite connectivity solutions across our region.

We offer mobile and fixed data services and a comprehensive suite of digital services to major corporates, non-governmental organisations, government departments, diplomatic missions, start-ups and small- and medium-sized businesses (SMEs). We also offer business ICT support, including conferencing and collaboration services, cloud and data centre co-location services, and Airtel Money services, and can provide data sovereignty for organisations through in-country data centres. With our partner Cisco, we provide access to Cisco Meraki SDWAN (software-defined wide area network), which is a suite of features designed to allow a network to dynamically adjust to maintain connectivity. At the same time, our low earth orbit (LEO) satellite connections reach places that other networks can't – delivering essential services to customers including NGOs and mining, oil and gas companies.

In 2022/23, we agreed a distribution partnership with OneWeb, our related party, to provide LEO connectivity for a wide range of use cases in rural areas, including agriculture, hospitals, hotels and schools, as well as the energy and mining sectors. We also agreed a partnership with Amazon Web Services to provide our customers with cloud data services.

Our customers create value and unlock the possibilities of digitalisation in the wider economy. So, by supporting them, we support opportunities for the people and businesses around us, while also creating value for Airtel Africa: this year, Airtel Business saw a  $18\%$  increase in fixed data connections. Our annual revenue grew by  $17.5\%$ .

The DIAN project: digital innovations for agropastoral communities in Niger

We want digital inclusion to reach the remotest parts of our markets – and few communities are as remote as the agro-pastoral shepherds and farmers of Niger. In July 2022, Airtel Business co-launched a public-private partnership dedicated to supporting that community: the digital innovation for agro-pastoralists of Niger (DIAN/IDAN) project.

The project aims to increase the resilience and food security of agro-pastoral families in southwestern Niger by providing an accessible digital platform for people involved in agriculture and livestock breeding. It includes a contact centre, an e-marketplace, and a portfolio of mobile financial products for agrobusinesses, allowing

micro credit, micro-savings, credit scoring, and payments and reimbursement via mobile. Users will be able to access Airtel Money services, and get information on agriculture, livestock and financial products.

DIAN depends on the cooperation of a range of partners: SNV (Netherlands Development Organisation), the Ministry of Livestock of Niger, Airtel Niger, AREN (Association for the Revitalisation of Livestock in Niger) and GAJEL (Group for Cultural Action and Development of Young Breeders). And it is a great fit with our sustainability strategy, enabling digitalisation and extending financial inclusion to a vital community in Niger's economy.

'Tribe' – the app helping our retailers serve customers while complying with regulations

The retailers and agents in our distribution network are dedicated to connecting customers to the Airtel network and improving their experience – and they need to do so while complying with the regulations and policies in place in their market, including fraud prevention rules. These regulations are unique to each of our 14 markets, and change over time. So, to help our retailer network stay compliant while serving customers, we've developed the retailer Tribe app.

The retailer Tribe app, available on the Android platform, can be accessed by our network of GSM retailers and Airtel Money retailers. It is a highly configurable product, allowing us to build a feature once and make it available to all 14 markets, while also providing a localised experience that meets country-specific regulatory requirements and can be adapted to enable market-specific features. It can also meet local language needs: currently, all features in the app are supported in English, French, Malagasy, Swahili and Kinyarwandan.

Tribe has allowed us to deliver new capabilities fast – and also helps retailers grow their business. The app supports both SSO (single sign-on) and Airtel Money agents and has both GSM and Airtel Money features, allowing retailers to add a new revenue stream by becoming both an Airtel Money agent and a SIM-selling outlet. The app also helps retailers understand their gross performance, track commissions, and understand commission rules.

As of 31 March 2023, in Zambia alone, 4.3 million Know Your Customer (KYC) transactions and 1.6 million SIM swap transactions were conducted on the retailer Tribe app. We expect this number to grow as we continue to strengthen our retailer network and add features to Tribe.

# Connecting to people and partners, and considering stakeholders' views

We're a business based on connecting people. Engaging with our stakeholders helps us build the shared understanding and mutual, long-lasting value that underpins our purpose of transforming lives. That enables us, and those around us, to thrive.

# Our section 172 statement

This section describes how the directors have acted in relation to their duties under section 172 (a) to (f) of the Companies Act 2006 to promote the success of the company with regard to the needs of wider society and stakeholders, including customers, consistent with our core business objectives.

Each year, directors receive training on corporate governance from our corporate legal advisers Herbert Smith Freehills which includes a reminder of their duties to apply section 172 to their considerations and decisions. Consistently applying our purpose, vision and core values (particularly 'respectful') when making decisions and delivering our strategy helps us meaningfully engage with all of our stakeholders, regardless of the outcome of any particular decision.

The information in this section explains how the Board oversaw stakeholders' interests and concerns, and considered them when making decisions in 2022/23.

# How we work to understand our stakeholders

Identifying the Group's key stakeholders and their interests, needs and level of influence is fundamental to successful stakeholder engagement. Our stakeholder identification is guided by the AA1000 Standard, which defines key stakeholders as 'individuals, groups of individuals or organisations that affect and/or could be affected by an organisation's activities, products or services and associated performance with regard to the issues to be addressed by the engagement'.

Our stakeholder matrix recognises stakeholders upon which we have the most significant impact on and those with the most material influence on the Group's activities. This allows us to identify priority stakeholders. The following priority stakeholder groups were identified in the process:

Our customers  
Our people  
Our communities  
- Our partners and suppliers  
- Governments and regulators  
Shareholders

# How we work to understand our stakeholders

To put stakeholder views at the heart of our decision-making, we need to understand the interests of each stakeholder group. This happens throughout our organisation, from informal conversations to formal consultations, and we continue to work to ensure good communication with all the people and groups we interact with. Directors are kept informed about our stakeholders' views in a number of ways, including through their own direct interactions – as outlined below.

# Ensuring the Board stays informed and engaged

Our Board stays connected to stakeholders through regular reports and updates from our senior leadership team, who channel information from our OpCos as well as engaging directly with stakeholders themselves. Every Board paper now includes stakeholder interests that are relevant to the decisions being considered and the likely consequences of our decisions in the long term. Directors visit our local operations, and we hold Board meetings at regional offices that hear from representatives from the local businesses.

Our stakeholder engagement policy is founded on the principles of transparency, active listening, and equitable treatment, and favours a consultative and collaborative engagement with all stakeholders. The policy commits us to proactively keeping our stakeholders informed of business developments, rigorously upholding international standards for transparency, and continuously refining our understanding of our stakeholders' needs and expectations.

We know that our stakeholders will hold a range of views about the decisions we take – and that not everything we do will please everybody, all the time.

Our chair is committed to ensuring that the Board hears both positive and negative stakeholder views and is supported in this by the executive team. The chair, the chairs of each committee, senior independent directors, CEO, CFO and our company secretary are all available to address any concerns raised by stakeholders.

All engagements with stakeholders by anyone at Airtel Africa are underpinned by our set of business standards, which have stakeholder interests at their core. Our Code of Conduct sets out our high expectations for how all of us should behave, including respect for human rights, data privacy, and acting lawfully at all times. It helps support our belief that the value we create as a business must ultimately be shared between all stakeholders and contribute towards renewing and reaffirming the trust that they have in us – and we have in them.

For more information about our Code of Conduct and modern slavery statement, see www.airtel.africa

# Engaging with the media

We recognise the critical importance of local, regional and international media engagement. As objective reviewers and reporters of our progress, journalists and media outlets play an important role in furthering our engagement with our wider stakeholder groups. Our communications functions at the Group level and across our 14 markets have established strong relationships with key media outlets and journalists which they continue to develop and evolve, providing regular and timely updates on our progress, activities and important announcements.

We tailor our engagement with media to reflect the focus and interest of each publication. For example, for international, investment and business-led titles, we provide regular updates on the financial performance and strategic direction of the business, ensuring that our executive leadership team is available for interviews and commentary. For regional and pan-African titles, we update on market developments, product launches and our contribution to Africa's economic and societal development. In our markets, we provide details of activities that are relevant to the local communities. In addition, we communicate with our industry sector titles and publications interested in our sustainability performance. We are committed to complete transparency in all our reporting to media and consider this an important conduit to demonstrate our corporate purpose and values.

# Our stakeholders continued

# Our customers

More than 140 million customers across Africa use our data, voice and mobile money services to connect, live and work.

# How we engaged during the year

Feedback from our customers helps define the success of our products and services – and plays a vital role in how we improve customer experience.

This year, we stayed in touch with our customers through face-to-face engagements and through our increasing range of self-care touchpoints. In our growing network of 802 retail experience stores, we had service and product purchase conversations, provided assistance, answered inquiries, and listened to feedback. Customers choosing self-care options could use social media platforms, email and MyAirtel app to manage their accounts, access mobile money services and get support.

Through our call centres, customers used our dynamic interactive voice response (IVR) system or spoke directly to agents to get assistance and service. Customers were asked to complete surveys after interactions with our contact centres, through SMS.

Our Board continued to be informed of significant customer concerns and priorities through the CEO's regular update and was able to channel these insights into its customer and product-related decisions.

# Interests and concerns

We analyse qualitative and quantitative feedback from customers regularly. From these analytics, we glean insights – ‘the voice of the customer’ – regarding customer suggestions, ‘pain points’ and ‘pleasure points’.

Affordability was a key interest for customers in 2022/23, as many people in our markets faced steep inflation, especially in food and fuel prices. Reliability and network quality are also customer priorities, while some customers wanted more options for personalising their plans to suit their needs. Customers continued to tell us they want to be able to easily use our products and services at times that are most convenient for them, and they also want quick and easy support.

Airtel Money customers are looking for convenient platforms that enable them to make payments and remittances across the globe as simply as with cash, but with added safety and security – they were particularly interested in wallet access, transaction success and information availability.

Our enterprise customers told us they need dedicated support to meet their service-related queries. The Board receives insights from these activities as part of regular business reports at each meeting.

# Outcome and actions

We've listened to our customers and continued to improve our customer service, while our expanding network offers more coverage and better access to data and mobile money services than ever before.

We've strengthened our self-service options to make our service faster, and in particular built on our Airtel Money self-service options, enabling PIN management in seven markets, and simplified transaction processes (and self-service transaction reversals to remedy inadvertent errors). We also upgraded our contact centre technology so that we have tailored services for Airtel Enterprise, postpaid and broadband customers. Our new enterprise self-care portal launched in two markets, and we intend to expand access to all markets over time.

# Our people

Listening to our people helps us make Airtel Africa a great place to work for all our employees in 17 countries.

Bi-annual employee engagement survey

# How we engaged during the year

We are constantly looking for ways to enhance our communication, connection and engagement with all our employees. This year, that included:

- Town halls at Group and OpCo level, held after each quarterly results announcement and on an ad hoc basis (such as our celebrations of International Women's Day in March 2023), where employees can ask questions, make suggestions and raise concerns with senior leaders.  
- One-on-one engagements where senior Group or OpCo leaders meet employees as part of our open-door policy  
- Regular OpCo visits where function heads and our CEO engage with teams, then raise any issues or concerns at a Group ExCo level  
Monthly business reviews, where regional directors and our CEO discuss employee issues  
- Employee wellbeing initiatives, and celebrations of national days and key holidays

Our Board actively engaged with employees throughout the year. Board members attend town halls and visit OpCos to meet employees and hear their views, as well as receiving regular updates from the CEO and CHRO. They also stay connected on employee-related matters through their involvement with our Sustainability Committee and the Human Resources Committee which provide valuable insight when developing and reviewing our people strategy. Our chair attended our annual leadership conclave in March 2023, and meets senior leaders regularly. Sunil Bharti Mittal is our designated Board director for employee engagement, given his regular travel to our operating companies. He is able to join employee events during the year to hear and respond to questions and listen to people's stories – both informally and formally. He shares the outcomes of this with the Board and the senior management team, as relevant. For more information about Sunil Bharti Mittal's engagement with employees in his capacity of the non-executive director, see page 129.

# Interests and concerns

There are 4,000 people in the Airtel Africa team, so the interests and concerns they raise are varied and wide-ranging. Health and wellness continue to be an important issue, alongside career growth, rewards, and learning and development. In our town hall meetings employees raise questions about our strategic direction – this year seeking information about our move to 5G and our approach to our new fibre holding company – and make suggestions on issues such as systems and automation.

Employees also frequently express their support for the communities in which they work and seek out opportunities to support the people around them in areas such as education, health and disaster relief.

# Outcome and actions

It is vital that we understand and respond to the views of employees, because we want to continue to attract, develop and retain a highly skilled, diverse and engaged workforce – and maintain a high-performance culture. The Board has overseen and approved several programmes and policies that support our people strategy.

To support employees' health and wellbeing, we provide medical check-ups at our offices and access to physical fitness sessions, while we invite financial advisers to our workplaces to help employees manage their money. Our employee assistance programme provides access to professional counsellors.

We want our people to have fulfilling and rewarding careers, so we have a defined performance and reward system, and we look to promote internally, providing people with assignments where they can grow their skills and capabilities. This is supported by our learning and development programmes, including our online learning platform, Percipio, in-person training, and cross-border and cross-functional training.

For more information about how our Board monitors our people's KPIs, see 'Win with people' on page 37 and sustainability strategy on pages 38-55

# How we engaged during the year

We are always open to the views and interests of our communities, and we place them at the heart of what we do – our 'respectful' value reminds us that we 'share the joy and pain of the communities around us'. People in our communities engage with us in a wide range of ways, including through conversations with our OpCos and regional leaders, letters, emails and text messages. We also hear from governments and other organisations about key community issues during the year, and connect to people through our community initiatives, such as our 'Touching lives' programme in Nigeria.

Our Board regularly reviews our formal programme of community initiatives, and directors hear from senior management when communities have made specific requests or raised concerns.

# Interests and concerns

People in our communities have many concerns and interests that are at the heart of our business strategy. These include extended network coverage, reliable and affordable services, and financial inclusion – reflecting the fact that many people in our communities are customers as well as neighbours.

Communities also raise specific issues with our OpCos and regional offices, relating to local needs in areas such as education, health and disaster relief. This was particularly true in 2022/23, when rising fuel and food prices in many markets contributed to significant cost-of-living pressures, and some communities were still feeling the economic and health effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.

# Outcome and actions

We work with communities and governments across our markets to transform the lives of some of the most vulnerable people on the continent by:

- Creating educational opportunities, especially for less privileged children  
Supporting people in times of need and emergency  
- Bridging the digital divide through financial inclusion and other initiatives

Our five-year  $557m$ partnership with the United Nations Children’s Educational Fund (UNICEF) covers 13 of our markets, championing digital education through online platforms, connectivity and access to quality digital learning. Six of our OpCos have now launched initiatives through this partnership, supporting more than 250,000+ children with access to online education. Our long-standing ‘Adopt a school’ programme also supports education, with several projects undertaken in 2022/23.

We reported on many of our long-term projects in our Sustainability Report, published in October 2022.

For more information about how we support communities, see our sustainability strategy on pages 38-55

# Partners and suppliers

We work with more than 2,600 suppliers across Africa, including mobile brands, IT companies and telecoms infrastructure providers – with the top 100 suppliers accounting for just over  $88 \%$ of our procurements.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/b466c5e8-a974-4f7e-87ee-1dc562965b0e/31990c13efa7c12f22e11890f49f386f9d00191e61461816d2732503c716899e.jpg)

# 79%

of our top 100 suppliers responded to our ESG self-assessment survey in 2022/23

# 96%

of suppliers who responded to our ESG SAQ have established a code of conduct

# How we engaged during the year

This year saw a welcome return to more direct, in-person engagement with our partners and suppliers, as Covid-19 restrictions on movement and meetings were almost entirely lifted. The experience of working remotely, however, has meant that we now have well-established channels to engage suppliers and partners both virtually and face-to-face. We have also seen the benefits of our sourcing team being based in Dubai, which is the regional headquarters for a number of suppliers and partners in our markets.

We continued to engage with our top suppliers at both HQ and OpCo levels. The post-pandemic return of the MWC Barcelona convention meant we were able to engage a number of key suppliers at senior leadership level, and our CEO met peers from our top suppliers regularly during the year.

Engagement with suppliers included governance meetings, commercial meetings and, where necessary, grievance meetings. Our OpCo teams continued to discuss operational matters with suppliers at country level.

Environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues were an important area of engagement this year for our partners and for us, and we asked our top 100 top suppliers to conduct an ESG survey.

The Board receives relevant information from our engagements with suppliers through the CEO's report. Our CEO then relays the Board's response to the business and leaders at his regular ExCo and business review meetings.

For more information about our Code of Conduct and modern slavery statement, see www.airtel.africa

# Interests and concerns

Strong partnerships with suppliers have always been an important part of our business model, and this year partners continued to engage with us to discuss win-win solutions. Their interests this year included discussing ways to reduce environmental impacts (for us and them), and ways to navigate the economic situation, which featured high inflation and currency devaluation in some markets. Partners and suppliers also approached us about the adoption of new technologies, and we discussed sales and project plans, bids and proposals, and payments.

# Outcomes and actions

We made useful progress in a number of areas related to our sustainability strategy, while also publishing our first Sustainability Report in October 2022. From our ESG survey of our top 100 suppliers by spend, we received a  $79\%$  response rate, helping us build valuable data on environmental impacts in our value chain that feeds into our net zero plans, and which will identify opportunities to improve our performance. At the same time, fuel price increases in a number of markets accelerated our partnership programmes with key partners and suppliers aimed at establishing a renewable or lower-carbon approach to our operations.

We also reached agreement with four key suppliers to support us with our rollout of 5G in six markets, building capacity in our business for the data opportunity we see ahead.

# Our stakeholders continued

# Governments and regulators

We engage closely with governments and regulators in all our markets, supporting their ambitions for digital and financial inclusion while working to create a viable business environment in which we can create shared value.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/b466c5e8-a974-4f7e-87ee-1dc562965b0e/7ed6e076ae118829af1086d26a22383829c3924cd714008e348c036d1d187a00.jpg)

# 99

# How we engaged during the year

Our stakeholder engagement plan provides broad guidance on who should engage governments and regulators on behalf of the company, depending on the seriousness and materiality of the issue under discussion.

Engagements can take various forms. For serious and material issues, we rely on formal channels which may involve us writing to the regulator or relevant government department on the issue of concern, or holding a formal, minutes meeting. Other engagements happen at informal government events, product launches, and industry gatherings.

We also engage through local industry associations, and international industry associations, including the GSMA.

Our Board continues to have a productive and open dialogue with regulatory bodies and policymakers and sets high standards of governance across our business. A special adviser to the chair and the Board provides advice to the management on political, legal and regulatory issues regarding our long-term strategy in Africa. The Board has empowered the CEOs and chief regulatory officers of our OpCost to represent them at country-level engagements with governments and regulators and to feed back any issues for Board-level discussion. An example of successful engagement at this level was the reduction of corporate tax in Zambia from  $40\%$  to  $35\%$  to align with other industries. Management also informs the Board about regulatory developments in the markets each month. From time to time, we also commission audits to verify levels of regulatory compliance.

# Interests and concerns

Each government has unique priorities and approaches, but interests and concerns in 2022/23 fell broadly into the following categories:

- Revenues – which were the main focus this year as economies experienced turbulence in most of our markets  
- Security – which includes a focus on KYC and anti-money laundering regulations, particularly for countries addressing internal security concerns  
- Access to affordable services – a key issue for governments trying to unlock the opportunity for financial and digital inclusion  
- Fair competition – ensuring that markets are fair and open.

# Outcomes and actions

We understand governments' focus on revenues and we continue to meet our tax obligations, being recognised as among the largest taxpayers in most of our countries of operation. Alongside this, we seek to demonstrate to governments that their societies benefit from the shared value we create wherever we operate, and advocate equitable taxation across all sectors of the economy. This is supported by our sustainability strategy.

We ensure that all our activities are properly licensed, and use our compliance management system to ensure that all our operations comply with licence obligations. We closely monitor compliance with KYC and AML requirements, which are a special focus area for governments fighting terrorism, money laundering and the financing of terrorism.

We monitor the quality of our network to ensure that it meets regulators' quality of service standards, and that their citizens enjoy affordable coverage and a reliable service.

# How we engaged during the year

We aim to encourage shareholder participation by understanding and acting on shareholder feedback and by being clear and transparent when communicating with our shareholders, and with potential investors and analysts.

Our investor relations team maintains a two-way dialogue between the investment community and Group management, executives and the Board. At the same time, we keep a range of channels open for communication, including this Annual Report, our Sustainability Report, press releases and updates, and live conference calls and presentations held at each quarterly results announcements. Our website is kept updated for investors to access investor-specific information on financial, operating and sustainability issues, and our senior leaders hold investor road shows and investor conferences where they meet shareholders virtually or in person.

Our Board receives and discusses a detailed report from our investor relations team every month, which includes an update on shareholder engagement and any interests or concerns raised. The Board also receives regular updates from our corporate brokers. The Board uses these insights to inform its shareholder engagement strategy and to consider the long-term consequences of its decisions.

# Interests and concerns

Investors are typically interested in the opportunity we have for sustainable growth, and in 2022/23 focused particularly on our plans for Airtel Money in Nigeria, following our award of a licence to operate as a payment services bank in April 2022. There has also been growing interest in our approach to environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, and in particular our performance on carbon emissions.

They are also keen to understand our plans for capital allocation and balance sheet intentions, and in 2022/23 were interested in how we repatriate cash from key markets. Investors also want to understand our approach to risk, and in 2022/23 were particularly interested in how we mitigate foreign exchange risks, with some being concerned about the volatility of currencies in some of our markets.

Shareholders are understandably also interested in shareholder returns.

# Outcomes and actions

Our Board is kept well informed of the views of shareholders and is able to take them into account when taking major strategic and operational decisions. As an example, since IPO the Board has taken into consideration investor feedback when re-looking at the capital allocation policy, by changing the dividend policy (and cutting the dividend) and prioritising US dollar debt reduction alongside a lower leverage target.

In October 2022, we published our first Sustainability Report to inform shareholders and other stakeholders on our progress in ESG matters.

Our investment throughout the year in our network and in additional spectrum demonstrates our confidence in the opportunity for growth for our business. We also kept investors informed of our initiatives to reduce Group debt, and to localise some debt to our OpCos while arranging to pay more suppliers in local currency, to mitigate currency risks.

5 Net finance costs of  $723m has increased$ 320m from the prior period largely due to higher foreign exchange and derivative losses of  $245m mainly comprised of a$ 67m loss on derivatives and higher foreign exchange losses arising from the revaluation of balance sheet liabilities (a loss of $82m on devaluation of the Nigerian Naira, and other devaluation losses of $96m mainly arising from the Kenyan and Ugandan shilling and Malawian and Zambian klwacha).  
6 Non-operating exceptional items in the previous period include a gain of  $111m on the sale of telecommunication tower assets in the Group's subsidiaries in Madagascar, Malawi, Rwanda and Tanzania, partially offset by costs of$ 19m on prepayment of $505m of bonds.  
7 Tax exceptional items in the year ended 31 March 2023 reflect the recognition of a deferred tax credit of  $117m in Kenya,$ 25m in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and $19m in Tanzania, respectively.

# A resilient business, delivering on growth opportunities while managing macroeconomic volatility

We have delivered a strong set of results which demonstrate the resilience of our business model and the effective execution of our strategy across all our regions, with double-digit reported currency revenue growth of  $11.5\%$  despite inflationary pressures and currency devaluation in most of our markets. Underlying EBITDA grew by  $11.4\%$  in reported currency, while we maintained our underlying EBITDA margin despite significant inflationary cost pressures.

We were also able to return considerable value from various OpCos, including Nigeria, where the year saw challenges in the availability of US dollars.

We have further de-risked our balance sheet by continuing to localise our debt into the OpCos and reducing our HoldCo debt. By year-end, almost  $64\%$  of our OpCo debt was in local currency.

The opportunity for growth is still clear. Our markets remain underpenetrated by both mobile and mobile money services, and our strategy is meeting that demand, while delivering clear social benefits by bridging the digital divide and fostering financial inclusion. We anticipate sustained growth in the business, with continued EBITDA margin resilience.

# Our four main financial objectives remain the same:

# 1. Growing our operating profitability

We have delivered double-digit revenue and underlying EBITDA growth in reported currency. Our profitability has proven to be resilient, too, as we maintained underlying EBITDA margin broadly in line with last year, despite significant inflationary cost pressures, particularly fuel costs in Nigeria and some other markets, and an average currency devaluation of  $6.1\%$ .

Operating profit during the year grew by  $14.5\%$  in reported currency, with constant currency growth of  $20.1\%$ .

# 2. Investing for future growth and improving our return on capital employed

Almost  $87 \%$ of our capex investment in 2022/23 was directed to growth initiatives which, combined with spectrum purchases, ensure a sustainably strong and reliable network. We invested  $748 \mathrm{~m}$  in capex (excluding spectrum), and almost  $\$ 500 \mathrm{~m}$  in spectrum (which includes 5G) in key markets, to improve network capacity and quality and reinforce a future- ready network.

We also invested in IT and cybersecurity, to further protect our business from the global threat of cyberattacks, focusing on the areas of application, network and API security.

We monitor the effectiveness of our capex investment through our financial KPI 'return on capital employed'. Regular monitoring of this KPI helps us track the performance of our assets while also taking long-term financing into consideration. Our return on capital employed has improved to  $23.3\%$ , an improvement of 101 basis points from  $22.3\%$  in the prior year.

# 3. De-risking our balance sheet

Our strong performance and continued focus on our capital allocation priorities has helped us further de-risk our balance sheet. In July 2022, the Group prepaid  $450m of external debt at HoldCo. The remaining debt at HoldCo is now$ 550m, falling due in May 2024.

We continued to localise our debt into our OpCos while reducing HoldCo debt. Our gross OpCo debt of  $3,676m (including lease liabilities) is now higher than our remaining HoldCo debt of$ 550m. We will continue to focus on further strengthening our balance sheet.

Leverage was at 1.4x in March 2023, broadly flat from the previous year despite our significant investment in spectrum to enable our future growth.

# 4. Returns to shareholders

Our aim is to enhance returns to shareholders over the medium- to longer-term. Our progressive dividend policy aims to grow the dividend annually by a mid- to high-single-digit percentage. In line with our dividend policy, we paid an interim dividend of 2.18 cents per share in December 2022, reflecting an increase of  $9\%$ . Further, the Board recommended a final dividend of 3.27 cents per share, making total dividends of 5.45 cents per share, which is an increase of  $9\%$  compared to the prior year.

Basic EPS was 17.7 cents, up by  $5.2\%$  from 16.8 cents in prior period. This increase was mainly due to higher operating profits and the recognition of a deferred tax credit of  $117\mathrm{m}$  in Kenya, \)25\mathrm{m} $in the DRC and$ 19\mathrm{m} $in Tanzania, respectively partially offset by higher foreign exchange and derivative losses. EPS before exceptional items and excluding foreign exchange and derivative losses increased by \(13.4\%$ .

# Outlook

We continue to deliver value to all our stakeholders, transforming lives of our communities and supporting the economies of the countries where we operate. We believe that the fundamentals of our business remain strong, and we remain well positioned to seize growth opportunities while at the same time continuing to strengthen our balance sheet, improve our return on capital employed and increase return to shareholders. We are mindful of inflationary pressures, currency devaluation and re-patriation risks due to the fluctuating availability of US dollars in some of our markets. These pressures are likely to continue next year, and we will continue to work on mitigation plans. Our capex outlook (excluding spectrum) for next year is around  $800m to$ 825m, which includes additional investment in our data centre and fibre businesses, where we see opportunities to further monetise our infrastructure assets.

# Financial review

Revenue in reported currency grew by  $11.5\%$ , with constant currency revenue growth of  $17.6\%$  partially offset by currency devaluation. The slowdown in revenue growth from the previous year was due to a loss of tower sharing revenues following the sale of towers in Madagascar, Malawi and Tanzania in the second half of the year and NIN-related barring of voice services in Nigeria. Excluding these, the growth would have been approximately  $21\%$  in constant currency. Total revenue for mobile services and mobile money services combined grew in Nigeria by  $20.3\%$ , East Africa by  $17.4\%$  and Francophone Africa by  $12.7\%$ , respectively.

Revenue growth was recorded across all reporting segments, with mobile services revenue for the Group up by  $16.2\%$  , reflecting Nigeria growing by  $20.3\%$  , East Africa by  $13.4\%$  and Francophone Africa by  $11.9\%$  , respectively. Double-digit revenue growth was recorded in both key services: voice revenue grew by  $11.8\%$  and data revenue by  $23.8\%$  . Mobile money revenue grew by  $29.6\%$  in constant currency, driven by  $32.6\%$  growth in East Africa and  $20.3\%$  growth in Francophone Africa.

Net finance costs increased by  $320m, largely due to higher foreign exchange and derivative losses of$ 245m. This increase mainly comprised a $67m loss on derivatives and higher foreign exchange losses arising from the revaluation of balance sheet liabilities (a loss of $82m on devaluation of the Nigerian naira, and other devaluation losses of $96m mainly arising from the Kenyan and Ugandan shilling, Malawian and Zambian kwacha).

Total tax charges were lower by  $185m mainly due to the recognition of a deferred tax credit of$ 117m in Kenya, $25m in the DRC and $19m in Tanzania. Non-controlling interests was down $37m due to the buy-back of minorities in Nigeria and lower minority allocation charges in Tanzania, partially offset by the increase in Airtel Money minority shareholdings.

EPS before exceptional items was 13.6 cents, a reduction of \(15.0\%\) largely because of higher foreign exchange and derivative losses of \\(245m. Basic EPS at 17.7 cents up by \(5.2\%\) due to higher operating profits and an exceptional gain on deferred tax credit recognition in Kenya, the DRC and Tanzania partially offset by higher foreign exchange and derivative losses. EPS before exceptional items and excluding foreign exchange and derivative losses increased by \(13.4\%\).

Our balance sheet has also been further de-risked by continued localisation of our debt into the OpCos and continued debt reduction in HoldCo, following the  $450m HoldCo bond prepayment in July 2022. Leverage at 1.4x in March 2023 was broadly stable despite$ 500m spectrum investment during the year.

In terms of outlook, long-term opportunities remain attractive for us. While mindful of currency devaluation and repatriation risks, we continue to work actively to mitigate all our material risks and deliver value for all our stakeholders.

# GAAP measures

# Revenue

Revenue grew by  $11.5\%$  to  $\$ 5,255\mathrm{m}$  in reported currency and by  $17.6\%$  in constant currency. The differential in growth rates was due to an average currency devaluation between the periods, mainly in the Central African franc (11.7%), which is largely pegged to the euro, the Nigerian naira (6.1%), the Kenyan shilling (9.4%), the Ugandan shilling (4.9%) and the Malawian kwacha (22.6%), in turn partially offset by appreciation in the Zambian kwacha (8.8%). The revenue growth of  $17.6\%$  in constant currency growth was driven by both customer base growth of  $9.0\%$  and ARPU growth of  $7.4\%$ .

Mobile services revenue grew by  $16.2\%$  in constant currency supported by growth across the regions: Nigeria up by  $20.3\%$ , East Africa by  $13.4\%$  and Francophone Africa by  $11.9\%$ , respectively. Mobile services revenue growth was driven by both voice and data services, voice revenue grew by  $11.8\%$  and data revenue by  $23.8\%$ . Mobile money revenue grew by  $29.6\%$ , driven by  $32.6\%$  growth in East Africa and  $20.3\%$  in Francophone Africa.

The slowdown in revenue growth from the previous year was due to a loss of tower sharing revenues following the sale of towers in Madagascar, Malawi and Tanzania in second half of the year and NIN-related barring of voice services in Nigeria. Excluding these, the growth would have been around  $21\%$  in constant currency.

# Operating profit

Operating profit increased by  $14.5\%$  in reported currency to  $\$ 1,757$ m as a result of strong revenue growth and continued improvements in operating efficiency in East Africa and Francophone Africa.

Operating profit (\$m)

# Net finance costs

Net finance costs were  $723m, an increase of$ 320m largely due to higher foreign exchange losses of  $178m and higher derivative losses of$ 67m as a result of foreign exchange movements. The higher foreign exchange losses arose from the revaluation of balance sheet

Profit after tax (\$m)

liabilities (including current and non-current borrowings and lease liabilities) following certain currency devaluations across most of our OpCos, including a loss of  $82m on the devaluation of the Nigerian naira, and other devaluation losses of$ 96m mainly arising from the Kenyan and Ugandan shilling and Malawian and Zambian kwacha. Net finance cost (excl. foreign exchange and derivatives losses) were $385m, an increase of $75m, largely driven by higher interest on lease liabilities. Interest costs on market debt were broadly flat.

The Group's effective interest rate increased to  $7.7\%$  from  $5.6\%$  in the prior period, largely driven by an increase in base rates, increase in local currency OpCo debt and the repayment of HoldCo bond, which had lower rate.

# Taxation

Total tax charges were lower by  $185m mainly due to the recognition of a deferred tax credit of$ 117m in Kenya, $25m in the DRC and $19m in Tanzania. Excluding exceptional items, tax was lower by $26m mainly due to the lower profit before tax on account of higher foreign exchange and derivative losses.

# Profit after tax

Profit after tax was  $750m, down by 0.6%, as growth in operating profit was offset by higher foreign exchange and derivative losses of$ 245m. Profit after tax excluding foreign exchange and derivative losses was up by 21.2%.

# Basic EPS

Basic EPS was 17.7 cents, up by  $5.2\%$  from 16.8 cents in the prior period. This increase was mainly due to higher operating profits and exceptional items gain on deferred tax credit recognition in Kenya, the DRC and Tanzania, partially offset by higher foreign exchange and derivative losses.

# Net cash generated from operating activities

Net cash generated from operating activities was \(2,208m, up by 9.8% largely driven by higher operating profit which was partially offset by higher tax payments on the increased local profits and withholding tax on dividends by subsidiaries. While in some markets we faced instances of shortage of foreign currency within the local monetary system, we benefited from a broad geographical diversification which enables access to liquidity, with limited impact on the Group requirements.

# Alternative performance measures

# Underlying EBITDA

Underlying EBITDA was \(2,575m, an increase of 11.4% in reported currency and 17.3% in constant currency, driven by strong revenue growth. Underlying EBITDA margins were largely flat at 49.0% despite

inflationary cost pressures, a drop of 3 basis points in reported currency and 14 basis points in constant currency. We continue to work towards mitigating the inflationary cost pressures through various cost initiatives.

Foreign exchange had an adverse impact of  $281m on revenue, and$ 133m on underlying EBITDA, as a result of currency devaluations. Average currency devaluations between the periods were mainly in the Central African franc (11.7%), the Nigerian naira (6.1%), the Kenyan shilling (9.4%), the Ugandan shilling (4.9%) and the Malawian kwacha (22.6%), in turn partially offset by appreciation in the Zambian kwacha (8.8%).

With respect to currency devaluation sensitivity, on a 12-month basis, a  $1 \%$ currency devaluation across all currencies in our OpCos would have a negative impact of  $51 \text{m}$ on revenues,  $\$ 31 \text{m}$ on underlying EBITDA and  $\$ 23 \text{m}$ on finance costs (excluding derivatives). Our largest exposure is to the Nigerian naira, for which a  $1 \%$ devaluation would have a negative impact of  $22 \text{m}$ on revenues,  $\$ 12 \text{m}$ on EBITDA and  $\$ 7 \text{m}$ on finance costs (excluding derivatives).

See the risk factors section for detailed disclosure on the currency devaluation risk posed to the Group on page 96.

* Underlying EBITDA margin %

# Effective tax rate

The effective tax rate was  $38.8\%$ , compared to  $39.0\%$  in the prior period, due to profit mix changes amongst the OpCos. The effective tax rate is higher than the weighted average statutory corporate tax rate of approximately  $33\%$ , largely due to the profit mix between various OpCos and withholding taxes on dividends by subsidiaries.

# Exceptional items

No operating exceptional items were incurred in the current year. Operating exceptional items in the previous period consists of a  $12m provision for expected settlement of a contractual dispute in which one of the Group's subsidiaries is a party and$ 20m costs of agreeing historical spectrum fees in one of the Group's subsidiaries.

Non-operating exceptional items in the previous period include a gain of  $111m on the sale of telecommunications tower assets in the Group's subsidiaries in Tanzania, Malawi, Madagascar and Rwanda, partially offset by one off costs of$ 19m (including applicable premium paid) on the early repayment of $505m bonds in March 2022.

The tax exceptional item in current period related to the recognition of a deferred tax credit of  $117m in Kenya,$ 25m in the DRC and $19m in Tanzania.

EPS before exceptional items was 13.6 cents, a reduction of \(15.0\%\) largely as a result of higher foreign exchange and derivative losses of \\(245m. Excluding foreign exchange and derivative losses, the EPS before exceptional item was 20.6 cents, an increase of \(13.4\%\).

# Operating free cash flow

Operating free cash flow was  $1,827m, up by 10.4%, as higher underlying EBITDA more than offset increased capital expenditure. Capital expenditure during the period increased$ 92m due to planned network expansion and investments into the PSB and data centre opportunity in Nigeria.

# Leverage and balance sheet measures

Leverage at 1.4x net debt/underlying EBITDA, was broadly stable despite  $500m of spectrum investment during the year. Our balance sheet has also been further de-risked by continued localisation of our debt into the OpCos – now almost \(60\%$  of our OpCos debt is in local currency – and continued debt reduction in HoldCo. In July 2022, the Group prepaid \)450m of external debt at HoldCo. The remaining debt at HoldCo is now $550m, falling due in May 2024. Cash at the holding companies was $398m.

# Dividend paid to shareholders

Final dividend payment of 3 cents per ordinary share for year ended 31 March 2022 was paid during the year and an interim dividend payment of 2.18 cents per ordinary share paid in December 2022. In line with our progressive dividend policy which aims to grow the dividend annually by a mid to high single-digit percentage.

The Board recommended a final dividend of 3.27 cents per share for year ended 31 March 2023.

We provide performance data for our mobile voice and data services, and Airtel Money in our business review on pages 62-73.

# Financial information by market

We provide performance data for each of our markets in our business review on pages 66-71.

# Consolidated statement of financial position

The consolidated statement of financial position is set out on pages 174-175. Details on the major movements of our assets and liabilities in the year are set out on this page.

# Assets

# Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment (including capital work in progress) increased to  $2,507m, an increase of$ 104m due to capital expenditure of  $735m, mainly related to expansion of our network, PSB and IT security which was partially offset by$ 435m of depreciation and $196m of foreign currency translation reserve.

# Right of use assets

Right of use assets increased to  $1,497m, an increase of$ 388m due to the capitalisation of the present value of telecommunication towers taken on long-term lease, partially offset by $280m of depreciation.

# Other intangible assets

Other intangible assets, including assets under development increased by  $578m to$ 1,212m. This relates to  $627m of investment in spectrum and licence, and capitalisation of present value of deferred spectrum charges amounted to$ 89m, partially offset by $103m of amortisation.

# Balance held under mobile money trust

The balance held under mobile money trust represents the funds of mobile money customers which are not available for use by the Group, and these have increased by $103m.

# Total equity and liabilities

# Total equity

Total equity increased to  $3,808m, an increase of by$ 159m related to  $750m profit for the period, partially offset by$ 195m dividend to shareholders of Airtel Africa, other comprehensive loss of $353m (largely due to foreign currency translation reserve) and $52m dividend to minority shareholders in subsidiaries.

# Borrowings

Gross borrowings (including short-term borrowings) increased by  $293m to$ 4,225m, largely due to increase in lease liabilities by  $387m and higher external loan of$ 368m at OpCos, mostly in local currency, offset by prepayment of $450m bond at HoldCo. Net debt of the Group as of 31 March 2023 was $3,524m.

# Current liabilities

Current liabilities (excluding borrowings) increased by  $268m to$ 2,232m, largely due to renewal of 2100 MHz spectrum licence for a gross consideration of $127m (paid in April 2023) and increase in mobile money wallet balance.

Further details of the Group's liquidity position and going concern assessment are shown on page 175 and Note 2.2 of the financial statements.

# Dividends

# Managing our risks

We operate in 14 markets across Africa. Our markets offer both long-term growth opportunities and a diverse range of risks and uncertainties. Managing these risks is an essential part of delivering our strategy. It means we can continue to create value for our business and shareholders, and for the millions of people whose lives we help transform.

# Identifying and managing risk

The directors have carried out a robust assessment of the company's principal and emerging risks to comply with Provision 28 of the Governance Code. We have designed our risk management framework to give us a consistent means of identifying, mitigating and monitoring risk across all 14 of our OpCos and Group entities. It provides senior management and our Board with oversight over our principal risks and promotes a bottom-up approach to identifying and managing risks across the Group.

# Risk management governance

The Airtel Africa plc Board has overall responsibility for the Group's risk management framework and processes. Through the Audit and Risk Committee, the Board oversees the Group's risk management framework and regularly reviews its principal risks as well as emerging risks that may impact the Group. Within that overarching framework, the governance of risk management has been cascaded to various levels across the organisation to allow effective management of the Group's risks. The framework covers the interplay between risks impacting Airtel Africa as a whole and risks identified at either the OpCo-level (geography-related) or the functional level (business function-related). Our Group Executive Risk Committee (ERC) evaluates and prioritises the principal risks with the potential to undermine our strategy, business model and solvency, in line with our overall risk appetite. The committee also reviews on an ongoing basis the external business environment to identify emerging risks which could potentially have an impact on the Group's business in the future. Group functional teams identify functional risks cutting across our OpCos to create a consistent Group-wide risk mitigation strategy for similar risks. We operate a similar risk management governance structure at Group level and within our OpCos, with both having an Executive Risk Management Committee, and with overall risk management responsibility resting with the respective boards. Each OpCo identifies risks within their business environment and takes appropriate mitigation actions. The governance of risk management at each OpCo rests with the OpCo Executive Risk Committee (ERC) and the OpCo Board, which is responsible for risk management processes and oversees the OpCo's principal risks and the effectiveness of its mitigation actions.

# Board - Audit and Risk Committee

The Board has overall responsibility for the Group's risk management processes. Through the Audit and Risk Committee (ARC), the Board oversees the Group risk management framework, approves the Group's risk appetite, and regularly reviews our principal and emerging risks.

The Board maintains oversight on the effectiveness of the Group's risk management processes through regular reviews of the Group's principal and emerging risks. This year, the ARC carried out several detailed thematic risk reviews across several functions within the business. See pages 117-127 for the ARC chair's report.

# Group Executive Risk Committee

The Group Executive Risk Committee (ERC) is responsible for the implementation of the risk management framework across the Group. The ERC reviews our significant risks and the progress and effectiveness of mitigation actions, ensuring that the Group operates within its defined risk appetite.

The ERC meets quarterly and carries out robust reviews of the Group's significant risks cutting across its operating markets and functions. It also reviews and discusses emerging risk trends with potential impact on the Group's business.

# Functional risk management reviews

The Group executive functional heads are responsible for identifying and mitigating risks across the Group within their functional area. They are responsible for embedding risk management within operational business processes. The Group's risk register is created from risks identified either by the Group functional heads or the OpCo Executive Risk Committees.

The Group functional heads carry out ongoing risk reviews as part of their operational functional processes. These risk reviews address risks within their functions across the Group's operating footprint.

# OpCo Executive Risk Committee and OpCo Board

The OpCo Executive Risk Committee (ERC) performs a similar role to the Group ERC. It is responsible for implementing the risk management framework in our subsidiaries. It identifies risks within the local environment and mitigation actions to manage those risks. Each OpCo Board has overall responsibility for the risk management process within that OpCo.

The OpCo ERC meets on a quarterly basis while the OpCo Boards review the OpCo's principal and emerging risks at least on a semi-annual basis.

# Our risk appetite framework

The Group's risk appetite framework and statement formalises the Group's risk appetite, tolerance limits and governance oversight processes to ensure that risks across the Group are managed within acceptable limits. Airtel Africa adopts a four-point scale for risk appetite, described below.

# Open

We strongly accept these risks as they are incidental to the achievement of our business objectives. These risks provide good risk/reward trade-off, and internal competencies exist to manage or exploit these risks effectively.

# Flexible

We are open to accepting these risks on a justifiable basis. We will consider available options and select the option that provides good returns with an acceptable level of risk in the pursuit of our objectives.

# Cautious

We will accept these risks only if essential, with limited potential for a negative outcome. We prefer to avoid these risks and where these risks are accepted, the risks are carefully measured and monitored.

# Averse

We are strongly opposed to these risks and prefer to avoid them. We are not open to any risk/return trade-off and will always accept the lowest risk option for these risks.

Risk

Changes

Covid-19

This risk was dropped as a principal risk for the Group. Over the past three years since the start of the pandemic, the Group has developed internal capabilities to effectively manage and adapt its operations to cope with varying levels of disruptions attributed to the pandemic. The risk impact is also lower, as evidenced by the removal of public health restrictions and the re-opening of economies around the world.

Exchange rate fluctuations and shortage of foreign currency

This risk has been modified from 'Exchange rate fluctuations and availability of foreign currency for repatriation' to 'Exchange rate fluctuations and shortage of foreign currency'. This revised risk description reflects the fact that in some of our operating markets, we face instances of limited supply of foreign currency within the local monetary system, which not only constrains the ability of the Group to fully benefit from strong cash generation at the OpCo but also negatively impacts our ability to make timely foreign currency vendor payments in the affected markets.

Uncertain and constantly evolving legal and regulatory requirements and environment

This risk has been modified from 'Non-compliance to legal and regulatory requirements' to 'Uncertain and constantly evolving legal and regulatory requirements and environment'. The Group takes all reasonable effort to comply with its legal and regulatory obligations in all the jurisdictions where it operates. However, in some markets, we are faced with the risk of unanticipated changes in the legal and regulatory environment and compliance requirements which can expose the Group to adverse financial and/or reputational impact.

Our operating costs are subject to supply chain risks, including fluctuations in global commodity prices, market uncertainty, energy costs (such as diesel and electricity), and the cost of obtaining and maintaining licences, spectrum and other regulatory requirements. Prevailing macroeconomic conditions and a variety of other factors beyond our control, such as rising global inflation and the impact of the war in Ukraine on the prices of commodities, also contribute to this risk. To mitigate this risk, the Group continually re-evaluates its operating model and cost structure to identify innovative ways to optimise our costs and improve profitability. During the financial year, there was significant inflation in the price of fuel (diesel) putting pressure on our operating costs, particularly in our Nigeria operation. This fuel price inflation resulted in an opex increase of $245m in the financial year attributed to increases in the cost of diesel.</td><td>1 Continuous review of our operating model and supply chain processes to identify cost optimisation opportunities

We derive revenue and incur costs in local currencies where we operate, but we also incur costs in foreign currencies, mainly from buying equipment and services from manufacturers and technology service providers. That means adverse movements in exchange rates between the currencies in our OpCos and the US dollar could have a negative effect on our liquidity and financial condition. In some markets, we face instances of limited supply of foreign currency within the local monetary system. This negatively impacts our ability to make timely foreign currency vendor payments and constrains our ability to fully benefit at the Group level from strong cash generation by those OpCos. Given the severity of this risk, specifically in some of our OpCos, Group management continuously monitors the potential impact of this risk of exchange rate fluctuations based on the following methodology: 
a) Comparing the average devaluation of each currency in the markets in which the Group operates against US dollar on a three-year and five-year historic basis and onshore forward exchange rates over a one-year period. 
b) If either of the above devaluations is higher than 5% per annum, management selects the highest of these exchange rates. 
c) Management then uses this exchange rate to monitor the potential impact of using that rate on the Group&#x27;s income statement so that the Group can actively monitor and assess the impact on the Group&#x27;s financials. 
Based on the this methodology, the weighted average yearly potential devaluation of the basket of currencies in which the Group is exposed is estimated to be in the range of 7% to 8%. 
With respect to currency devaluation sensitivity, on a 12-month basis, a 1% currency devaluation across all currencies in our OpCos would have a negative impact of $51m on revenues, $31m on EBITDA and $23m on finance costs (excluding derivatives). Our largest exposure is to the Nigerian naira, for which a 1% devaluation would have a negative impact of $22m on revenues, $12m on EBITDA and $7m on finance costs (excluding derivatives). 
This does not represent any guidance and is being used solely to illustrate the potential impact of further currency devaluation on the Group for the purpose of exchange rate risk management. The accounting under IFRS is based on exchange rates in line with the requirements of IAS 21 &#x27;The Effect of Changes in Foreign Exchange&#x27; and does not factor in the above-mentioned devaluation.</td><td>1 Renegotiating forex-denominated contracts to local currency contracts

# Emerging risks

Climate change: we continue to evaluate the potential impact of climate change on our business operations and on the economies in which we operate. In October 2021, we launched an ambitious sustainability strategy that underpins our well-established corporate purpose of transforming lives. As part of our 'reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions' goal, our ambition is to achieve net zero emissions ahead of the 2050 deadline set out in the Paris Agreement. To achieve this, we understand the importance of fully identifying, measuring, and reducing GHG emissions which can only be achieved in partnership with our peers and the wider industry.

In January 2022, we engaged The Carbon Trust, one of the worldleading environmental consultancies, for their advice and assistance with several aspects of our GHG emissions measurement, management, and reporting. In October 2022 we published our first Sustainability Report 2022 where we set out the framework for our decarbonisation strategy and published our baseline GHG emissions. For more details, see pages 38-55.

In addition, we plan to launch a sector-leading and credible decarbonisation strategy which we will be publishing on our website www.airtel.africa

Operating a uniform risk management framework across our operating footprint allows for consistency of approach and puts us in good stead to deal with and respond to our constantly changing environment.

# Our long-term viability statement

The preparation of this long-term viability statement involved the Board reviewing the Group's long-term prospects and ability to meet future commitments and liabilities as they fall due over the three-year review period, including scenario analysis on liquidity events through stress and sensitivity tests to assess the resilience and strength of our forecasts.

# Viability statement of Airtel Africa plc

In accordance with provision 31 of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board assessed our long-term strategic prospects, as well as the ability of the Group to meet future commitments and liabilities as they fall due within the assessment period.

The Group prepares a ten-year strategic business plan which is used for long-term forecasting purposes and impairment testing (including strategic decisions such as capital investment) and is aligned with the average life of our regulatory licences and network assets and the potential opportunities in the under-penetrated emerging African telecom sector.

For the purpose of our long-term viability assessment, the Board primarily focuses on liquidity and assesses the Group's long-term viability assessment over a three-year period for the following reasons:

- Our three-year liquidity plan matches the average tenure of our financing arrangements and;  
Key macro and political developments which impact on our headroom and liquidity include currency devaluation, inflation, fiscal policies and sovereign credit ratings. Our visibility of impact that these factors have on debt markets generally reduces past three years.

While the Board believes the Group will be viable over a longer period, given the inherent estimation uncertainty involved in forecasting liquidity assumptions over a longer period, the Board concluded that a three-year period provides a reasonable degree of confidence while still retaining a longer-term perspective. Although our long-term viability assessment is performed over a three-year period, which matches the current tenure of our financing arrangements as a matter of prudence, the Group also assessed viability on a five-year time horizon. Given the maturities of our existing financing arrangements, which are materially within the three-year period, the assessment on this five-year period did not result in material changes in conclusion as compared to the three-year assessment period. For goodwill impairment test, the Group has used a ten-year period, taking into account the nature of markets in which the Group operates, the period of its licences, etc. as against the three-year period for viability assessment which focuses on the Group's liquidity plan.

In assessing the Group's prospects, the directors considered 5G cellular network potential in the markets in which the Group operates. The Group's first endeavour is to secure spectrum for 5G launch and roll out 5G network in key markets. During the financial year, the Group secured 5G spectrum in Nigeria, Kenya, Zambia and Tanzania and will selectively launch 5G services in these markets. Given the relatively low 4G customer penetration in the countries where it operates, the Group will continue to focus on its strategy to expand its data services and increase data customer penetration by leveraging and expanding its leading 4G network.

This assessment is prepared based on our strategy, and adequate sensitivity and stress tests have been conducted through various scenarios, both individually and collectively, based on our overall risk assessment framework.

# Board's assessment

# Assessment period

The viability assessment is based on our current business model (see page 24 of this report), a three-year prospect horizon, and our strategy (see pages 26-37).

# Long-term prospects

and headroom analysis Our three-year plan has been prepared considering organic growth potential in the geographies where we operate.

# Principal risk assessment

Our risk evaluation is described on pages 90-97. While each principal risk has been carefully evaluated both individually and collectively, and an adequate monitoring and mitigation plan has been defined, we have also considered sensitivity analysis and stress tests on the three-year projections.

# Scenario analysis

We have quantified the impact of sensitivities on cash and liquidity headroom availability, both individually and collectively, in reasonable worst-case scenario. In assessing the impact of sensitivities on cash and liquidity headroom, we have considered various mitigating actions which could be undertaken to ensure sufficient liquidity.

Assessment of headroom based on forecast cash flows and sensitivities to assess our ability to meet future commitments and liabilities as they fall due over the next three years.

Our multinational footprint means we are constantly exposed to the risk of adverse currency fluctuations and the macroeconomic conditions in the markets where we operate. We derive revenue and incur costs in local currencies where we operate, but we also incur costs in foreign currencies, mainly from buying equipment and services from manufacturers and technology service providers. That means adverse movements in exchange rates between the currencies in our OpCos and the US dollar could have a negative effect on our liquidity, financial condition, and long-term prospects. In some markets (especially Nigeria and certain East African OpCos), we face instances of limited supply of foreign currency within the local monetary system. This not only constrains our ability to fully benefit at the Group level from strong cash generation by those OpCos but also impacts our ability to make timely foreign currency payments to our international suppliers. Given the severity of this risk, specifically in some of our OpCos, Group management continuously monitors the potential impact of this risk of exchange rate fluctuations as well as the limited supply of foreign currency and performs stress tests while assessing the Group's liquidity and prospects. The Group factors in the limited supply of foreign currency by way of considering potential devaluation, noting that an actual devaluation in future might result in better availability of foreign currency.

Additionally in some markets, our operating costs are subject to fluctuations in global commodity prices, market uncertainty, and energy costs (such as diesel and electricity). Prevailing macroeconomic conditions and a variety of other factors beyond our control, such as rising global inflation and the impact of the war in Ukraine on the prices of commodities, also contribute to this risk. To mitigate this risk, the Group continually re-evaluates its operating model and cost structure to identify innovative ways to optimise our costs and improve profitability.

The company ended the year in a strong financial position. Net cash generated from operating activities increased by  $9.8\%$  in the last 12 months to  $2.2bn, and our net debt to EBITDA ratio is 1.4x at the end of this financial year. Our cash balances, in conjunction with$ 525m of committed undrawn facilities at the date of approval of these financial statements, ensure we can continue to meet our financial obligations. During the year, we repaid approx. $450m of bonds earlier than their redemption date in May 2024. We were able to make these repayments because of our increased cash generation. Post these repayments, only $550m of long-term bonds will remain outstanding for the Group, with maturity falling in May 2024.

The Group will continue to benefit from population growth and the need for increased connectivity and financial inclusion in the medium to long term in the countries where we operate. In this respect, in 2022/23, the Group invested about  $1.2bn in capex,$ 748m in tangible capex, and $500m in spectrum acquisition in line with guidance. The vast majority of this capital expenditure is aimed at continuing to capture the growth opportunities across our footprint by increasing the coverage and capacity of our network as well as expanding our distribution.

The key risks considered in the stress tests, keeping in mind the demographic and sectoral dynamics along with their potential negative impacts, are detailed in the table below:

<table><tr><td>Sensitivity performed</td><td>Link to principal risks and uncertainties</td><td>Description</td></tr><tr><td>Slowdown in revenue growth</td><td>·Adverse competition and market disruption
·Technology obsolescence
·Network resilience and business continuity
·Digitalisation and innovation
·Cyber and information security threats</td><td>Revenue is projected on a number of assumptions such as subscriber base, rates and change in average revenue per user. A change in any of the assumptions due to adverse competition and market disruption may affect overall revenue growth. In most cases, changes in one such assumption (e.g., in rates) are compensated either fully or marginally by a corresponding change in other variables (e.g., subscriber base). Changes not fully compensated lead to a reduction in the rate of revenue growth. We have modelled stress test scenarios for various levels of slowdown across segments and revenue streams.</td></tr><tr><td>Increase in operating expenses</td><td>·Increase in cost structure
·Digitalisation and innovation</td><td>With operations spread across 14 markets and each country having a different economic and business environment, there is always a risk of operating costs increasing beyond projected levels.</td></tr><tr><td>Unanticipated regulatory and tax levies</td><td>·Uncertain and constantly evolving legal and regulatory requirements and environment
·Internal controls and compliance</td><td>As we work in diverse and dynamic legal environments, it&#x27;s necessary to establish and maintain adequate procedures, systems and controls to ensure we comply with our obligations in all the jurisdictions in which we operate. There will always be a risk of unanticipated regulatory and tax levies affecting our profitability and, therefore, additional tax and regulatory levies have been considered in the stress tests.</td></tr><tr><td>Exchange rate fluctuation</td><td>·Exchange rate fluctuation and shortage of foreign currency</td><td>We are constantly exposed to the risk of adverse currency fluctuations, given our operations in 14 different markets with different functional currencies. Furthermore, we could face low availability of foreign currency in some of our markets constraining our ability to fully benefit at the Group level from the strong cash generation of our local businesses. 
We have stress tested the plan for various levels of currency devaluation across operating entities, including the risk of availability of foreign exchange, leading to repatriation of cash from operating entities to the Group holding companies and the resulting impact on cash flows and liquidity headroom at the Group level.</td></tr></table>

As part of our assessment, in considering the above sensitivities we have also factored in possible mitigations against such sensitivities. None of the sensitivities (net of possible mitigations) impact our opening headroom by more than  $10\%$ .

# Conclusion

The results of stress-testing our forecasts over the three-year period for the above sensitivities demonstrate that the Group will be able to withstand these impacts over the period of its financial forecasts. The Board has a reasonable expectation that no single event or plausible combination of events would affect long-term viability, even under the severe stress tests, and the Group would be able to continue operating and meet its liabilities over the three-year period.

In order to reach this conclusion, the Board has considered:

- Possible actions to mitigate the impact of risks in the severe stress tests, including limiting or delaying discretionary capital expenditure without compromising on network quality, optimising operating expenditure and reducing or stopping dividend payments.  
- Accessing additional funding, including financing facilities and access to the debt capital markets in order to repay debt which matures over the three-year period while maintaining adequate liquidity headroom.

- The internal and external environment, current and long-term prospects, and the strategic intents and directions adopted by management.  
- The risk framework, potential sensitivities around the principal risks and mitigating factors.

The Board has concluded that the Group would be in a position to access debt capital markets and meet our financing needs as and when required.

Based on this assessment and in accordance with requirements of provision 31 of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board has concluded that we have the ability to continue our operations and be able to meet our commitments and liabilities over the assessment period.

The strategic report was approved by the Board of directors on 10 May 2023 and signed on its behalf by:

# Acting with purpose, underpinned by strong governance

# 66

Our robust governance mechanism has built resilience into our business and has uniquely shaped us to capitalise on market opportunities.

# 99

Sunil Bharti Mittal Chair

On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present our Corporate Governance Statement for the financial year 2022/23. As a Board, we're committed to applying the highest standards of corporate governance and transparency, recognising that robust governance and culture underpin business success. In this statement, we give our investors and other stakeholders an insight into the governance activities of our Board and its committees over the year.

By aligning our purpose, values, strategy and culture, we seek to achieve good governance, regulatory compliance and our ambitious sustainability strategy as we work across Africa. We do our best to lead by example and are working both in the boardroom and on the ground towards our corporate purpose: transforming lives. So we continue to invest in creating educational opportunities for the communities we serve, for example with our landmark partnership with UNICEF. I am proud of our commitment to bring access to quality education to more than one million children by connecting schools to the internet and zero-rated educational platforms (free internet access).

# Enhancing diversity

While our Board is diverse and inclusivity is one of our core values, we have to do more to improve diversity and inclusion across all levels of our organisation.

My Board is committed to supporting programmes and initiatives across the entire Group that will nurture and mentor key talent. And we're continually examining our recruitment processes to make sure they are perfectly aligned to meet these challenges.

We recognise that we're not starting from the same place as businesses in more developed economies. Even though we're determined to provide equal opportunities for women, gender parity in our business is still some way off. This is despite our best efforts and significant progress in appointing women to senior leadership positions across our 14 culturally different markets.

These appointments, which we hope will attract more women to take up senior leadership roles in our business, are shaping a deep talent pool and pipeline from which we hope to make senior executive appointments. This is critical to the long-term sustainability of Airtel Africa. So we've once again included a gender diversity metric in our executive directors' variable pay scorecard – to drive forward a diverse and inclusive workplace by increasing the proportion of woman employees.

# Remuneration

We're also starting from a different point when it comes to the changes being recommended to our remuneration policy. Finding, attracting and retaining highly skilled talent is a challenge for all businesses – and doing so across all the countries in which we operate adds to the complexity. While we do all we can to employ good practices and fit within a UK compliance framework, we have to balance our ambitions with the realities and demands of doing business in Africa.

To enable us to meet these challenges, we're submitting a revised policy for approval at the AGM this year. Last year's amendments were prudent measures reflecting good housekeeping prompted by the appointment of a new CEO (including pension arrangements, bonus deferral and post-employment holdings). The proposed changes this year to our remuneration policy are intended to help us do business in Africa more effectively. These are fully explained in our directors' remuneration report on pages 145-163.

The Board fully supports and endorses the work of the Remuneration Committee to attract and retain the right talent. We believe that granting a mix of performance shares with demanding performance conditions and restricted shares with a financial underpin is both appropriate and critical to delivering our talent agenda.

The Board also acknowledges the increasing governance expectations of Remuneration Committees and the value of continuing to build an understanding of broader remuneration policies and practices beyond our executive directors and Executive Committee.

# Employee development and engagement

During the year, the Board monitored projects to accelerate talent acquisition and to support and keep our own employees. The Board also ensured engagement with employees by attending gatherings such as the quarterly all employee town halls. The questions asked at these events provided a rich source of feedback for management. Both the CEO and I are impressed by the quality, range and depth of the topics discussed in this open forum.

# Purpose, values and strategy and alignment with culture

To meet their 2022/23 objectives of executing our purpose, values and general strategy and objectives; assessing and monitoring our culture; and promoting the alignment of culture with purpose, values and strategy, our Board:

- Reviewed our strategy for Board and executive-level succession planning and put into place processes for achieving this. See our Nominations Committee report on pages 128-133.  
- Monitored progress against our gender diversity targets at the levels of Executive Committee, country managing director and leadership. OpCo executive committee female gender representation also increased from  $28\%$  to  $29\%$ .  
- Supported our learning and development teams' capacity-building efforts across the Group, as well as ongoing initiatives around health, wellbeing and recognition, such as a Digital Labs programme to improve physical and mental health.  
- Stayed up to date on projects to attract new employees as well as to support existing employees, such as the 'Women in Tech' programme, Airtel Africa Mobility programme, young technology leaders 2022 training programme, and the set-up of Nigeria Digital Labs.

The Board continued to ensure that our resourcing – including capital, finance and people – is sufficient to achieve our strategy while continuously improving performance and diversity. This year, we had to address several critical macroeconomic challenges, including continuing fuel price increases, inflationary pressures coupled with drought, especially in some East African countries, and continuing FX shortages in Malawi and Nigeria. See pages 93-95 for more detail on the mitigating strategies the Board put into place.

# An effective and improving Board

Our Board evaluation confirmed that our Board functions effectively. It's well balanced and diverse, with a strong mix of relevant skills and experience.

I'm grateful to all the members of the Board for their individual contributions, and particularly to the chairs of each committee for establishing and steering their respective committees during the year. The Audit and Risk, Remuneration, Nominations and Sustainability Committee chairs have provided their own reports on their committees' activities.

# In conclusion

I remain confident that your Board is working effectively and is geared to addressing the company's needs. We have the right balance of skills, expertise and professionalism to continue to deliver strong governance, while allowing the CEO and CFO to implement and deliver our strategy. While I'm pleased with the Board's activities and approach, we continually look for ways to learn and to improve our corporate governance.

I very much look forward to meeting with shareholders at the AGM on Tuesday 4 July 2023, which will be live streamed from London. Along with all your directors attending the AGM, I'm available to respond to your questions, concerns and suggestions at any time.

Sunil Bharti Mittal

# Governance highlights for the year ended 31 March 2023

We published our first sustainability report in October 2022, building on the commitments set out in our sustainability strategy of October 2021.

We confirmed our commitment to achieve zero carbon emissions by 2050. A summary of our progress, including our engagement with The Carbon Trust, is on page 56.

We published our second TCFD statement in line with LR9.8.6R (8) requiring companies to share a clear statement of TCFD compliance and in keeping with our roadmap published last year.

We've improved and further applied our business model to deliver our strategic ambition to transform lives through financial inclusion and empowerment across the African continent by rolling out a reliable network, providing affordable data and serving our customers - see page 24 for our business model and see page 26 for our strategy.

We're delivering on our senior leadership succession plan: we made the strategic addition of a chief commercial officer to our ExCo and have seen several changes to our senior leadership team which will ensure that we'll continue to deliver our 'Win with' strategy.

We're addressing the gender balance challenge across our OpCos by championing initiatives that support diverse talent and thought as critical enablers of sustainable growth – see page 131 for details.

We've nearly completed the separation of Airtel Money – see page 112 for details.

We established new holding and subsidiary company structures for our fibre businesses in support of our Win with technology strategy. We are building a leading, modernised network that can provide the data capacity to meet rapidly growing demand, and enhanced connectivity and digitalisation needs of our markets.

We conducted a comprehensive, internally facilitated Board evaluation – see page 116.

We continued working to fully comply with the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code applying to Airtel Africa for 2022/23. We're currently compliant barring one provision: 9 (the independence of the chair).

# Our leadership continued

# Compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code

See pages 134-138 for how we comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code). Here we explain the provision not yet met.

<table><tr><td>Code provision</td><td>Explanation</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="5">Provision 9: the chair should be independent on appointment when assessed against the circumstances set out in Provision 10</td><td>The Board has concluded that our chair, Sunil Bharti Mittal, did not meet the independence criteria of the Code due to his interests in the company. However, in view of his extensive involvement with the company and the Bharti Airtel Group over many years, the Board considers that he has made a major contribution to our growth and success and unanimously agrees that his continued involvement is crucial to the ongoing success of Airtel Africa.</td></tr><tr><td>The Board has put several safeguards in place to ensure robust corporate governance during his tenure as chair. These include appointing Andy Green as senior independent director to act as a sounding board and support for the chair and as an intermediary for other directors and shareholders. The independent non-executive directors have carefully considered Sunil&#x27;s leadership position. As part of the annual Board evaluation process, they&#x27;ve looked at the checks and balances in place to mitigate the risk of having a non-independent chair, including the impact on board effectiveness and Board dynamics. They&#x27;ve concluded that these checks and balances are strong and effective. Airtel Africa has a strong culture, which has benefited from stable and consistent leadership of the business. The seven independent non-executive directors on the Board provide a fresh perspective and challenge, a range of corporate experience, and effective challenge to the chair and other executive directors. This was endorsed by the three consecutive external evaluation exercises undertaken since listing. The separate committees for audit, nominations and remuneration are each chaired by an independent non-executive director.</td></tr><tr><td>We also review the chair&#x27;s performance as part of the annual Board evaluation exercise. In line with the Code, the chair only sits on the Nominations Committee, which he also chairs.</td></tr><tr><td>The Board believes Sunil Bharti Mittal continues to effectively oversee our leadership and maintain a balanced shareholder agenda.</td></tr><tr><td>We&#x27;ll continue to report against this provision while Bharti Airtel remains a majority shareholder or until the chair is no longer in place, at which time these arrangements will be reviewed.</td></tr></table>

During this financial year, we became compliant with Provision 41 of the Code.

For more information on how we became compliant, see page 137

# The Board's focus in 2022/23

As well as our six scheduled meetings and the AGM, during the 2022/23 reporting period the Board met an additional two times to consider our full year financial statements and annual report approvals process and to approve our first sustainability report. As well as extra Board meetings when necessary, we have processes in place for approving one-off transactions and other matters arising between meetings – this occurred four times during the year.

# Strategy and execution

- Reviewed our strategic plan and worked to make sure our strategy stays robust in the light of forecast market and economic changes  
- Considered the articulation of our corporate purpose – building on our strong vision and values as stated in our business model

- Progressed the separation of Airtel Money

- Began the operational separation of Airtel Money from the GSM business in preparation for its IPO  
- Reviewed appropriate and optimal operating and ownership structures for the Airtel Money entities, including local ownership requirements  
- Took steps to empower and add to the management team to prepare for the separation  
- Discussed the risk and control framework. Concluded that we wanted to see a management system in place appropriate for a financial services company – with a chief risk and compliance officer and a culture of compliance and accountability

Culture

- Discussed how to define a culture that promotes a positive feeling of ownership around strong controls and compliance – and how the Board sets the tone for this  
- Discussed how the internal audit, risk and governance functions can promote culture during a recent training session, and how the Audit and Risk Committee should be assessing and monitoring culture on an ongoing basis

- Deep dives

Undertook deep dives into:

Our digital strategy  
- Our SmartCash PSB business  
Our data centre plan  
- Our fibre business plan

Each segment: Nigeria, East Africa, Francophone Africa and Airtel Money, which included discussion on the success of the execution of the respective business plans and performance reviews  
- Our organisational structure, including a restructuring of the ExCo to align with the strategic ambition and planned separation of Airtel Money  
Our regulatory function

# Strategy

- Continued to look at strategic opportunities to create value and expand our Airtel Money business by securing payment service bank licences and a super-agent licence in Nigeria – this allows us to create an agency network through our SmartCash Payment Bank subsidiary that can service the customers of licensed Nigerian banks, payment service banks and licensed mobile money operators in Nigeria  
- This aligned with the Board's strategy to revolutionise the financial services landscape in Africa, particularly Nigeria. This will further digitise the economy, and most importantly help bank the unbanked by reaching the millions of Nigerians without access to financial services by delivering current and savings accounts, payment and remittance services, debit and prepayment cards  
- Spent considerable time discussing the need for a more entrepreneurial culture, not just at management level but also within the Board. While keeping the highest levels of governance and complying with all regulations, there's scope to be more entrepreneurial and to make faster decisions and approvals for the businesses

- Reviewed and revised our investment strategy for buying spectrum to support our 4G network capacity expansion across our markets for both mobile data and fixed wireless home broadband capability, and for future 5G rollout. This provides significant capacity for continued strong data growth and reflects our continued confidence in the opportunities in our markets to support local communities and economies through digital inclusion and connectivity  
- Established a working group of the Board to work with the CEO on spectrum auction matters, recognising the need to act quickly in any auction within agreed parameters  
- Reviewed and approved our first sustainability report showing the Board's commitment to developing infrastructure and services to drive both digital and financial inclusion for people across Africa  
- Reviewed and committed to our five-year pan-African partnership with UNICEF to roll out digital learning through connecting schools and ensuring free access to learning platforms in 13 countries  
- Benefited from a presentation on geopolitical trends, opportunities for Airtel Africa in 2023 and opportunities to maximise influence – given by Paul Arkwright, special adviser to the chair and Board on political and security developments in our Op-Cos  
- Reviewed the Board, committee and senior management succession plans as presented by the Group chair on behalf of the Nominations Committee

Agreed to commit to:

- A $125m revolving credit facility that provides potential interest rate savings in exchange for achieving social impact milestones linked to digital inclusion and gender diversity with a focus on rural areas and women – also aligns with our sustainability strategy  
- A $194m facility with International Finance Corporation (IFC), a sister organisation of the World Bank and a member of the World Bank Group – we're committed to complying with the IFC's Performance Standards on social and environmental sustainability and have put in place an environmental and social action plan

- This is in line with our strategy to raise local currency and US dollar debt in our local operating companies. These facilities underpin our commitment to transforming lives across the communities where we operate, including addressing inequality and supporting economic growth  
- Reviewed the legal, regulatory and commercial aspects of potential structures for FX sourcing and repatriation of funds  
- Discussed proposing an alternative Naira investment strategy in light of the economic environment in Nigeria and the difficulty of repatriating dollars – work still to be concluded  
- Deloitte presented the audit plan and we considered whether this would drive further improvement in audit quality  
- Agreed that all future intermediary and consultancy fees above \(200,000 must be approved by the chair of the Audit and Risk Committee and presented to that committee every six months

Directors make every effort to attend all Board and committee meetings. All Board and committee meetings had full attendance during the reporting period.

If a director is unable to attend a meeting, they receive the papers in advance and give their comments to the chair to communicate at the meeting. The chair follows up with them after the meeting about decisions taken.

Directors' other significant commitments are disclosed to the Board during the process of their appointment, and they must notify the Board of any subsequent changes. We have reviewed the availability of the chair and the non-executive directors to perform their duties and consider that each of them can and does devote the necessary amount of time to Airtel Africa.

# Board evaluation

# Board performance

During the year the Board undertook an internal evaluation (the previous three annual exercises have been externally facilitated). This was conducted by the Group company secretary circulating questionnaires for feedback on a range of areas to the Board, the directors, and each committee. The questionnaire sought input on Board composition, stakeholder oversight, Board dynamics, management and focus of meetings, Board support, Board Committees and progress against the previous year's actions. The evaluation also probed the Board's oversight of wider strategy, risk management and internal controls, succession planning, and people oversight and priorities for change.

A report was prepared on the completed questionnaires. The Secretary then reported on this feedback to the chair and senior independent director The results were discussed in detail by the Board and each committee The chair had follow up discussions with directors on the findings of the evaluation. Separately, the senior independent director held a meeting of the non-executive directors without the chair to consider his performance and the running of the Board. This evaluation confirmed that the Board, its committees and individual members all continue to operate effectively and that each performed strongly during the year.

From the anonymised survey responses and interview feedback we identified focus areas and recommendations for the Board and its committees.

# 2022/23 evaluation results

The chair and company secretary presented the reports to the Board in May 2023 for discussion and review.

Recognising its strengths and areas to develop, the Board and its principal committees agreed actions for the coming year.

# Conclusions

The 2022/23 evaluation has shown that the Board has the appropriate balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge to perform Board and committee responsibilities effectively. Respondents unanimously agreed that the Board had performed well over the year and was operating effectively.

The chair confirmed that individual directors continued to perform effectively and show commitment to the role. The Board concluded that all directors continue to give sufficient time to their Board duties and are making valuable contributions. In light of this, the Board proposed the re-elections set out in the 2023 Notice of Annual General Meeting.

The chair, assisted by the company secretary, drew up a list of action points based on the evaluation and allocated responsibility for completing the actions. The Board and each committee will review progress against these at each meeting.

# Re-election of directors

In line with the Code, all directors will be putting themselves forward for re-election at our AGM on 4 July 2023. Following the formal performance evaluation described here and taking into account each director's skills and experience (set out on page 116), the Board believes that the re-election of all directors is in the best interests of Airtel Africa.

# Chair's statement

I'm pleased to present the work of our Audit and Risk Committee for the year ended 31 March 2023. My report sets out an overview of how this committee discharged its duties in compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code and provides an insight into the key matters and findings considered during the year.

Our members are unchanged. We remain a team of independent non-executive directors with the financial experience, commercial acumen and industry knowledge to fulfil our responsibilities.

In these challenging macroeconomic times, we continue to focus on ensuring the integrity of the Group's published financial information and the effectiveness of its risk management, controls and related processes.

As part of my commitment to connect with my management colleagues in person, during the year I visited our operating entities in Zambia and Nigeria. On these visits I met and spoke with local management who gave me valuable insights into their operations.

# Key areas of focus

We continued this year to look in depth at certain aspects of the control environment, particularly the presumed risk of management override of controls, including fraud, IT security and cyber risk. The findings of internal audit reviews during the year in each of these areas were shared with our committee.

There is one change and two modifications to our principal risks for the year ended 31 March 2023: Covid-19 was dropped as a principal risk for the Group, the risk on 'Exchange rate fluctuations and availability of foreign currency for repatriation' was modified to 'Exchange rate fluctuations and shortage of foreign currency' and the risk on 'Non-compliance to legal and regulatory requirements' was modified to 'Uncertain and constantly evolving legal and regulatory requirements and environment'. The principal and emerging risks and significant judgements made in connection with these risks are set out on page 93.

We examined in detail the interplay between the mandatory Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and our sustainability reporting. Our committee is comfortable with the approach adopted. For our TCFD disclosures, see page 56 of the strategic report.

As well as our usual review of accounting judgements and disclosures on key accounting matters, we reviewed the treatment of significant transactions during the year. These included the accounting treatment for the transfer of minority shareholders' interests in Nigeria SmartCash to Airtel Networks Limited (our Nigerian subsidiary) and, therefore, outside of Airtel Mobile Commerce BV (AMC BV) and the introduction of mobile money as a new operating segment. We continued to monitor the integrity of our financial statements and the effectiveness of the internal and external audit processes.

In addition to scheduled committee meetings, we meet regularly independently of management with both external and internal auditors and are satisfied that neither is being unduly influenced by management. I also hold regular meetings with our CFO and other members of management to better understand the issues that need discussion at committee meetings. And I regularly engage with key stakeholders, including Group internal assurance, senior management and our external auditor on committee work.

Our committee report is structured into five parts:

Part 1 - Our work during the year

Part 2 - Key transactions, judgements and estimates and our response

Part 3 - Risk management and internal controls

Part 4 - External auditors

Part 5 - Finance Committee

We continue to operate with openness and transparency, and a spirit of robust challenge when necessary, to make sure our shareholders and other stakeholders are protected.

In the coming year, our committee will focus on the control and compliance environment for the Airtel Money business as it completes its separation from the GSM business. We'll continue to look at and strengthen the focus on compliance across all levels and functions in the organisation using various measures, including training, process improvements, automation and robust consequence management policies to hold people accountable for their actions. The committee will also focus on actions to further mitigate risks of fraud, especially relating to the mobile money business.

I'd like to thank the management team at Airtel Africa and each of the committee members for their support and contribution during the year.

I welcome questions from shareholders on this committee's activities. To discuss any aspect of this report, please contact me through our company secretary, Simon O'Hara (see page 251 for contact details). Also, I'll be attending the 2023 AGM and look forward to the opportunity to meet and speak to you there.

# Audit and Risk Committee report continued

# Part 1

# Committee governance

# Key responsibilities

Our committee is responsible for overseeing:

- Accounting and financial reporting  
The role and mandate of the internal audit function  
- The selection, appointment and management of the relationship with the external auditor  
- Internal control and risk management systems

Detailed responsibilities are set out in our committee's terms of reference, which can be found at www.airtel.africa/investors/governance.

# Composition

Our committee consists of four independent non-executive directors: Ravi Rajagopal (chair), Andy Green, Annika Poutiainen and Awuneba Ajumogobia. The Board believes these directors have the necessary range of financial, risk, control and commercial experience required to effectively challenge management.

Provision 24 of the Code states:

i. At least one committee member should have recent and relevant financial experience. The Board is satisfied that Ravi Rajagopal meets this requirement. Ravi held financial leadership roles at Diageo until retiring in 2015, including Group controller in the UK and global head of mergers and acquisitions. His skills in finance, and control and risk, have been developed over a career working in senior strategy and management roles. As a qualified chartered accountant, Ravi has lectured at Oxford University and Imperial College.  
ii. The committee, as a whole, shall have competence relevant to the sector in which the company operates. As a collective, we have a thorough understanding of the telecoms and mobile money services sector and emerging markets in Africa, including recent and relevant financial experience and expertise gained through various corporate and professional appointments over the years.

Detailed biographies of our committee members are on pages 102-105 of this Annual Report. Our company secretary is secretary to this committee.

# Meetings during the year

Our scheduled quarterly meetings take place shortly before Board meetings. Before that, the committee has a pre-meeting to focus on internal audit and discuss any issues needing more time. We held five scheduled meetings and four combined internal assurance and pre-meetings during the year. Attendance during the year is set out on page 115.

We also met three times between the end of the financial year and the signing of this Annual Report.

Our meetings are also attended by the CEO, CFO, deputy CFO, head of internal audit and chief compliance and risk officer, along with internal audit partners (EY) and other senior executives. Representatives of our external auditor, Deloitte, were invited and attended all meetings. Akhil Gupta also attends our committee meetings as an appointed observer on behalf of Bharti Airtel.

Other senior finance and Executive Committee leaders sometimes attend and present to our committee if specialist knowledge is required.

The committee chair meets privately and separately with each of the Group CFO, chief internal auditor, chief compliance officer, and our external auditor to ensure the effective flow of material information between the committee and management. We also regularly make time for discussion at the end of meetings without management being present.

# Effectiveness

The Board evaluation reviewed the committee's effectiveness and sought feedback from its members. We discussed the output, which concluded that we had operated effectively throughout the year. Areas of challenge are identified throughout this report. We also confirmed our areas of focus for the year ahead.

<table><tr><td>2022/23 evaluation</td><td>Outcome</td><td>Key themes and areas for focus</td><td>Action</td></tr><tr><td>Audit and Risk Committee</td><td>Areas of focus</td><td>Risk</td><td>We will review the meeting agenda to spend more time reviewing risk.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Compliance and controls developments</td><td>We will focus more on embedding a culture of compliance and ensuring accountability for controls.</td></tr></table>

We review our terms of reference yearly to ensure clearer alignment with Code provisions and updated FRC guidance. There were no changes this year.

These terms of reference are available on our website at www.airtel.africa.

For details of the Board evaluation, see page 116.

# Our work during the year

At each quarterly meeting, we review summary reports from internal assurance, as well as financial results and details of actions taken or proposed plans. We also receive summary reports from our external auditors at the half year and year end. Our Committee chair then reports to the Board on our activities, recommendations, and other relevant matters.

# The committee's focus in 2022/23

Strategic focus for risk management and internal control  

<table><tr><td>2022/23 committee objectives</td><td>Actions taken</td><td>Cross-reference</td></tr><tr><td>Looking closely at the robustness of our systems for risk reporting, assessment and control and ensuring that we focus on the areas of greatest risk</td><td>We&#x27;ve increased our focus by spending more time in meetings on the subject. We completed deep dives on areas of risk, including network technology, IT systems, cybersecurity, revenue assurance and fraud controls.As part of the quarterly key control status update, we received descriptions of the key controls monitoring and reporting cycle for both ICOFR key controls and non ICOFR key controls. Our discussions led to improved controls training and a more consistent approach (ICOFR is an internal control over financial reporting process consisting of policies and control procedures to assess financial statement risk and reduces the risk around inaccurate financial reporting).As part of our key issues report, we conducted design and compliance reviews, assessed the quality of quantitative data and qualitative assessment and ensured that learnings were applied across the business.</td><td>See pages 90-92</td></tr><tr><td>Reviewing our risk management framework and conducting thematic risk reviews to ensure risk remains within our agreed appetite and is monitored and reviewed as needed to reflect external and internal changes</td><td>We continued to make progress in embedding the Risk Appetite Statement (RAS) framework and an exception-based risk reporting approach. We conducted an annual review of the key risk indicators and tolerance limits.We also made several improvements to the framework and plan, and conducted the following thematic reviews:Enterprise risk management review: we reviewed the Group compliance strategy and its mission ‘to establish and maintain adequate procedures, systems and controls to enable Airtel Africa to comply with its obligations’. The strategic goals are to:· Improve the maturity of risk management practices· Enhance the whistleblowing programme· Focus on high-risk areasData privacy: we reviewed the evolving risk landscape, including the changing legal framework for data privacy risk across the Group&#x27;s operating footprint. We adopted a Group-wide compliance strategy for data privacy risk. We subsequently received updates on progress and risk mitigation actions, and were assured by the Group&#x27;s response to these changes.Fraud risk assessment update: after implementing the fraud risk assessment policy the previous year, we ensured that all risks identified and entered on the risk register were accompanied by a risk mitigation plan and mapped to the audit plan. We welcomed the approach outlined and framework and methodology being adopted FINANCING and foreign currency risk: we discussed:· Exchange rate volatility and devaluation risk· Liquidity and refinancing risk· Depth of market/new products and banking landscape and treasury governance· Related internal controls and complianceAs most of Airtel Africa&#x27;s operations are in currencies which have and are expected to devalue against the USD in the medium/long term, we discussed mitigation strategies. We continue to oversee the rebalancing of debt from Group level to OpCo level.</td><td>See page 61</td></tr></table>

# Audit and Risk Committee report continued

# Part 1

2022/23 committee objectives

Actions taken

Cross-reference

Airtel Money Commerce B.V. (AMC BV): our committee discussed in detail the business process risk audit for the Airtel Money business. We agreed that the Nigeria Airtel Money rollout should be a separate item given the size and value of the risk. We sought to understand how the AMC BV Board was reviewing the issues identified by the Group internal assurance Airtel Money audits.

Before the launch of the Airtel Money service in Nigeria, we conducted risk reviews to ensure the adequacy of the controls and systems and to ensure they were in line with our service objectives. We kept abreast of all actions arising from these reviews.

We discussed in detail our responsibilities for overseeing the AMC BV business, particularly given the increasing pace of separation activities and the desire to avoid any unnecessary duplication of effort with the AMC BV Board. We analysed the current Airtel Money risk and compliance structure and systems to assess their fitness for purpose. We reviewed the plan reaching appropriate financial services regulatory supervisory standards, as well as the risk and compliance scope for the Airtel Money business.

We reviewed the register of significant risks and assessed regulatory-related implications of a breach. And we reviewed back-end controls and supported actions to strengthen Know Your Customer and minimise commission arbitrage.

Cybersecurity: we conducted a review of known incidents, commissioned several internal audit reviews and made an assessment of related risk on the business following which we adopted remediation plans. As a result, we reviewed the Group's cybersecurity strategy and appointed a Group chief information security officer with responsibility for defining and securing the Group's information security systems and processes, and for ensuring a robust information security control environment within our operations. We performed a cyber threat intelligence action to discover the risk of exposure of confidential data related to Airtel Africa from social media, dark web and other breached databases, and reviewed physical back up strategy and arrangements. We recognised that Airtel Africa's pre-paid model mitigates against any direct risk to customers, given that customers' personal bank details are not held.

Having reviewed cybersecurity risk, our committee adopted the Group's ransomware policy, cyber insurance policy, information security policy, data protection and privacy policy, and the virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) implementation. We reviewed the cybersecurity policy to ensure appropriate legal and technical advice was obtained and breach notification obligations understood. We also reviewed the strategic communications strategy.

Key risks and remediation actions for 2022/23 were identified. The ISO 2700 standard had been achieved and ISO 22301 certification status is being pursued.

We reviewed the risk of technology obsolescence and examined our network resilience and business continuity plans.

Culture: we reviewed the culture of compliance and arranged a training session. As a result of this, our chief internal auditor was instructed to establish a robust reporting framework for assessing and monitoring culture on an ongoing basis and to include these findings in the quarterly internal audit report to the Audit and Risk Committee, for subsequent sharing with the Board. The Remuneration Committee was also asked to review our incentivisation schemes to ensure the business is driving behaviours consistent with our purpose, values, strategy and culture. This work is ongoing.

We advised the Board that our risk management and internal control systems were effective.

Following its own review of the reports submitted to it, the Board agreed that our system of internal control continues to be effective in identifying, assessing and ranking the various risks we face as a business, as well as in monitoring and reporting progress in mitigating potential impact.

Clarifying processes and controls to help people identify, monitor and mitigate risk earlier and more effectively

We started the process of self-certification by business units as a further check on the rigour of the internal audit and external audit assurance process. This places accountability for assurance on operational staff.

Following a deep dive of fraud perpetrated in one OpCo, processes to improve revenue assurance and fraud prevention and detection were strengthened and rolled out across the whole business.

We started to review overall ratings on the quality of processes and controls identified for each OpCo, alongside a rating of end-to-end processes across all OpCos.

# Continuous Control Monitoring (CCM)

We reviewed and endorsed a data-led approach to continuous monitoring. We adopted an analytics platform which runs algorithms and checks on a large volume of transactions to identify potential red flags or outliers. Over time, we can assess baseline controls using this platform.

See page 56 for our climate change risk disclosures

Part 1  

<table><tr><td>2022/23 committee objectives</td><td>Actions taken</td><td>Cross-reference</td></tr><tr><td>Reviewing the assurance processes supporting certain aspects of the TCFD and sustainability sections in the 2022/23 annual report</td><td>The Group has identified its climate risks and opportunities after an assessment of the possible impact of climate change across its business and geographies. The Group has also put in place mitigation actions to address these risks as can be seen from the Group sustainability strategy and report. This important piece of work has governing oversight not only from the Audit and Risk Committee but also the Board Sustainability Committee which meets monthly to review the various mitigation actions in line with the Group&#x27;s strategy. Additionally, we have taken steps to develop the technical capability of our teams in identifying, assessing, modelling and creating viable plans to address these long-term climate risks. This is underpinned by our engagement with The Carbon Trust who have been instrumental in helping us along this journey and building the internal capacity within our teams.We, therefore, have concluded that the assurance processes supporting the narrative reporting in the Annual Report are satisfactory.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Supporting the Group&#x27;s sustainability strategy</td><td>Airtel Africa officially joined the Joint Audit Cooperation (JAC), an association of telecoms operators aiming to verify, assess and develop corporate social responsibility implementation across the manufacturing centres of suppliers. This action addresses third-party risks from an ESG perspective and whether third parties are complying with standards of compliance required from an ESG perspective with respect to labour laws, health and safety and other practices. Membership of the JAC allows us to conduct these ESG audits in a cost-effective manner through cost sharing with other global telcos.</td><td></td></tr></table>

# Ongoing financial reporting activities

We reviewed the integrity of the quarterly, half year and full year financial statements. We also examined other statements containing financial information, including trading updates and investor presentations and packs, and recommended their approval to the Board. At each of our meetings, we reviewed and constructively challenged the accounting methodologies, key estimates, and judgements and disclosures set out in the papers prepared by management - determining the appropriateness of these with input from the external auditor. Key transactions, judgements and estimates in relation to this year's financial statements are listed on page 123. We also reviewed existing and emerging litigation and regulatory risks.

# Reviewing the 2023 Annual Report

At the request of the Board, we reviewed this Annual Report to consider whether, taken as a whole, it was fair, balanced and understandable. We have robust governance processes in place to support the year-end review of the Annual Report, including ensuring that everyone involved understands the 'fair, balanced and understandable' requirements. Our considerations included:

# Fairness and balance

Is the Annual Report open, honest and accurate? Are we reporting on our weaknesses, difficulties and challenges alongside our successes and opportunities?  
- Do we clearly explain our KPIs and is there strong linkage between our KPIs and our strategy?  
- Is there a fair balance between alternative performance measures (APMs) and reported figures?  
- Do we show our progress over time and is there consistency in our metrics and measurements?  
- Does the narrative and analysis in the Annual Report effectively balance the needs and interests of our key stakeholder groups?

# Understandable

- Do we explain our business model, strategy and accounting policies in a simple way, using precise and clear language?  
- Do we break up lengthy narrative with quotes, tables, case studies and graphics?  
- Do we define industry terminology and acronyms?  
- Do we have a consistent tone across the Annual Report?  
- Are we clearly 'signposting' to where more information can be found?

Iterations of the draft Annual Report were provided to committee members throughout the production process. Following our formal review in meetings on 28 April, 4 May and 9 May, we confirmed to the Board that this Annual Report is fair and balanced and provides enough clarity for shareholders to understand our business model, strategy, position and performance. The directors then made their assessment following the Board's review of the document at its meetings on 28 March, 9 May and 10 May 2023.

# Part 1

# Governance

At each quarterly meeting, we receive and review summary reports with updates on upcoming proposals and regulations to UK corporate reporting. The FRC publishes thematic reviews and other guidance to help improve the quality of corporate reporting. We also receive summarised reports from our external auditors highlighting any proposed amendments to UK corporate reporting.

<table><tr><td>2022/23 committee objectives</td><td>Actions taken</td><td>Cross-reference</td></tr><tr><td>Meeting the UK&#x27;s Transparency Directive (TD) ESEF Regulation (ESEF regulatory technical standard), including &#x27;phase 2&#x27; requirements, prepared using the UKSEF taxonomy</td><td>We paid special attention to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the additional &#x27;phase 2&#x27; notes text block tagging in digital format under the TD ESEF Regulation. We made sure the necessary procedures had been completed by all parties, including our technical accounting team and our specialist external digital reporting providers. Our 2023 digital report uses the UKSEF taxonomy created by the UK Financial Reporting Council (FRC). We commissioned a voluntary assurance review on our 2023 ESEF Annual Report by Deloitte UK. Deloitte confirmed that the ESEF Annual Report was prepared and marked up in line with the requirements of the ESEF RTS.

# Accounting and financial reporting issues and our response

We considered the following accounting and financial reporting issues, judgements and estimates in the context of the financial statements and management override of controls and fraud, discussed them with our external auditor, and have found the response to each appropriate and acceptable.

<table><tr><td>Issue</td><td>How this was addressed by our committee</td></tr><tr><td>Going concern and long-term viability statement</td><td>As we advise the Board on the form and basis of conclusion underlying the long-term viability statement and going concern assessment, we reviewed these in depth and also considered the Group&#x27;s strategy and business model. 
Our review covered: 
• The Group&#x27;s prospects 
• The period under consideration 
• Principal risks (refer to pages 90-97) 
• Longer-term cash flow forecasts 
• The sensitivities considered in management&#x27;s stress-test to respond to principal risks 
Taking into account potential mitigating actions, we were satisfied with the conclusion and disclosure on the Group&#x27;s long-term viability and going concern. 
Our 2022/23 long-term viability statement and more details on the assessment is set out on page 98. 
More details about going concern assessment are on page 178.</td></tr><tr><td>Deferred tax asset recognition and classification as an exceptional item</td><td>One of our subsidiaries in Kenya had carried forward losses and timing differences on which deferred tax assets had not been recognised until 2022/23. During the year, management proposed the recognition of deferred tax assets on these losses based on projected profitability. Additionally, the Group has also trued-up deferred tax assets in our subsidiaries in Tanzania and DRC on deductible temporary differences based on updated probability of future taxable profits in these subsidiaries. 
We reviewed and challenged management&#x27;s assumptions and were satisfied that there were taxable profits against which tax losses and temporary differences could be used – meaning that such deferred tax assets should be recognised. We were also satisfied with the transaction being classified as an exceptional item in accordance with the Group policy on exceptional items.</td></tr></table>

# Audit and Risk Committee report continued

Part 2  

<table><tr><td>Issue</td><td>How this was addressed by our committee</td></tr><tr><td>Transfer of Nigeria SmartCash outside of the AMC BV perimeter</td><td>The Group&#x27;s minority shareholders in Nigeria have interests in SmartCash Payment Service Bank Limited, a direct subsidiary of the Airtel Mobile Commerce BV Group (AMC BV). As outlined on page 189, Note 5 of the financial statements, in August 2022, as directed by Central Bank of Nigeria, SmartCash was transferred to Airtel Networks Limited (ANL), a subsidiary of Airtel Africa plc outside the perimeter of Airtel Mobile Commerce BV Group.
The non-controlling interest in respect of SmartCash continued to be recognised in Airtel Africa&#x27;s consolidated financial statements despite the legal transfer of SmartCash from the AMC BV perimeter to ANL.
Our committee reviewed the accounting for the transaction and was satisfied that the conclusions were appropriate.</td></tr><tr><td>Disclosure of currency devaluation risk</td><td>As outlined in the principal risks and uncertainties section of this Annual Report, the Group is constantly exposed to the risk of adverse currency fluctuations and the macroeconomic conditions in the markets where it operates. Adverse movements in exchange rates between the currencies in OpCos and the US dollar could have a negative effect on liquidity and financial performance. Given the severity of this risk, specifically in OpCos who face a limited supply of foreign currency in the local monetary system, management presented how it continuously monitors the potential impact of this risk of exchange rate fluctuations.
After performing a detailed review, our committee was satisfied with:
• Management&#x27;s methodology for monitoring the potential impact of this risk of exchange rate fluctuations
• The mitigating action plans in place
• The reasonability of sensitivities adopted
• That appropriate disclosures are included in quarterly reports and the Annual Report
For more details on currency devaluation disclosures, see page 222, Note 32.</td></tr><tr><td>Mobile money as a new reporting segment and consequent goodwill reallocation</td><td>As outlined on page 190, Note 6.1 of the financial statements, the Group identified mobile money services as a new operating and reportable segment as of April 2022. This is due to the significant growth in mobile money and a corresponding change in its organisation structure combined with changes in the information provided to the chief operating decision-maker for allocating resources and assessing performance. Information for both current and comparative periods was presented for the four segments: Nigeria, East Africa and Francophone Africa mobile services, and mobile money services. Consequently, as per the requirements of IAS 36, the Group&#x27;s goodwill was re-allocated between four groups of CGUs based on the new segments, with $1.3bn being allocated to the mobile money group of CGUs. Our committee reviewed the basis for this change and is satisfied that appropriate segmental disclosures and goodwill allocations are included in the financial statements.</td></tr><tr><td>Review of tax/legal/regulatory matters</td><td>We reviewed the key developments in material tax, legal and regulatory cases during the period, management&#x27;s estimate of key tax, legal and regulatory disputes, and how these were rated as probable, possible or remote. We were satisfied with the accounting conclusions reached by management.</td></tr><tr><td>Goodwill impairment</td><td>We received a detailed management paper on impairment and challenged the appropriateness of the assumptions and judgements adopted for the annual impairment testing exercise in December 2022. We reviewed the sensitivities performed by management on key assumptions such as the discount rate, growth rates and the headroom if a five-year plan were adopted with appropriate long-term growth rates.
We also reviewed management&#x27;s consideration of the impact of climate change. Based on the analysis conducted so far, we were satisfied that any related costs are adequately covered as part of the impairment sensitivities and, therefore, no impairment would arise.
For more information on the Group&#x27;s goodwill impairment assessment, refer to page 97 of the financial statements.</td></tr><tr><td>Alternative performance measures (APMs)</td><td>The Group has revised the computation of return on capital employed (ROCE) by grossing up the &#x27;equity attributable to owners of the company&#x27; for put option provided to minority shareholders. The previous period&#x27;s ROCE was also restated for this change.
Further, during the year, underlying revenue has not been defined as an APM due to the absence of any exceptional items during the period.
The committee performed a detailed review on the use and disclosures of APMs within the Annual Report (including reconciliations disclosed) and concluded that the balance and equal prominence of APMs (in comparison to GAAP measures) was appropriate. The committee challenged management on changes to APMs and satisfied itself that the changes were appropriate.
For more information on APMs, refer to pages 240-245 of the Annual Report.</td></tr></table>

# Risk management and internal controls

# Our approach to risk

As highlighted in the strategy and risk sections of the strategic report, risk management is inherent to our management thinking and business planning processes. The Board has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining our risk management and internal control systems.

For more information on our risks and mitigation and our risk management framework, see the risk report on pages 90-97 and 161.

The Board also approved the statement of the principal risks and uncertainties set out on pages 93-97.

# Progress in 2022/23

Each quarter, our CEO and CFO provide a compliance certificate connected to the preparation of our financial results. This includes the policies and procedures for areas of the business under their responsibility and confirms the existence of adequate internal control systems throughout the year. Our committee reviews any exceptions noted in this exercise.

# Working to minimise the risk of fraud, bribery and corruption

Minimising the risk of fraud is one of the key priorities for internal audit, and we do this in a range of ways. These include assessing the quality of balance sheet reconciliations, key judgement matters, tenders and quotations, and controls over payments and associated applications.

The committee received and reviewed reports of attempted and actual fraud incidents during the year. We received comprehensive updates from management on the incidents and reviewed the root cause analysis and remediation plans to address gaps noted. The committee will continue to monitor the implementation of these plans across all markets, through management updates followed by verification from the internal audit team.

We continue to focus on limiting our potential exposure to bribery and corruption risks, for example by providing mandatory training, reviewing financial records and developing our policies and procedures. Our contract management system includes mandatory certification to our Code of Conduct and anti-bribery and corruption policy. Each year, every employee must take part in computer-based training on anti-bribery and corruption and our Code of Conduct. Our internal audit team reviews our anti-bribery compliance programme to assess its continued effectiveness. We will continue to assess bribery risks in our markets to refine and improve our anti-bribery compliance programme.

Our committee also monitors and oversees procedures around allegations of improper behaviour and employee complaints.

# Whistleblowing procedures

Our whistleblowing programme is a confidential channel through which employees can report unethical practices or wrongdoing. We have an independent whistleblowing process managed by an external professional services firm from their Centre of Excellence in South Africa.

Throughout the reporting period, we received updates on the volume of reports, key themes emerging from these reports and the results of related investigations. We assess the reports for the category and level of concern and consider these in line with a protocol for review, investigation, action, closure and feedback. This is done independent of management where necessary, and involving senior business unit or HR management as appropriate.

We continue to monitor the volume, geographic distribution and range of reports made to the hotline to understand key themes, the results of investigations undertaken, significant regional compliance concerns, and whether access to this facility is less understood or publicised in some countries.

During the 12 months ended 31 March 2023, we investigated 34 incidents (2022: 74) received through various touch points and our formal whistleblowing channels. These were of varying magnitude, with five above the ExCo threshold – these and the measures taken in response have been reported to our committee. Of these 34 cases,  $92\%$  have been closed. The very small number of reports that contained allegations of a breach of our Code of Conduct were thoroughly investigated and disciplinary action was taken where appropriate.

The majority of reports received during the period were human resource issues which indicated no compliance concerns or serious breaches of our Code of Conduct.

Our committee chair reports to the Board at each of its meetings on the operation of our Code of Conduct, anti-bribery and corruption and whistleblowing procedures. This report contains enough detail to enable the Board to oversee these areas and make sure arrangements are in place for a proportionate and independent investigation of related matters and for follow-up action.

# Internal Audit

Our internal audit team considers compliance with internal policies, regulatory obligations and fraud risk mitigation as part of its independent testing and evaluation. Airtel Africa has adopted an internal audit co-sourcing model where the internal audit activity is carried out by a partnership of our group internal audit department and EY as the internal audit service provider. The team is governed by the internal audit charter, as approved by the Audit and Risk Committee, and is headed by our chief internal auditor who reports to the committee and the CEO. The committee chair regularly meets with the chief internal auditor to discuss the team's activity and any significant issues arising from its work.

Our committee approves the annual audit plan in the first meeting of each financial year. We then receive quarterly updates on activities, progress against the plan, the issues arising from audits and action plans to address concerns. This year, we reviewed and approved the detailed audit plan as dynamic and ensuring that internal audit's areas of focus remain appropriate. During the year, internal audit focused on principal risks as well as emerging risks, including cybersecurity and regulatory compliance. This year, we looked closely at how to remediate key issues more quickly and address risks in order of priority.

During the reporting period, we also approved the three-year Internal Assurance strategic plan that will guide the development of this function. This is focused on improving delivery, increasing automation and on a new approach to talent and staffing centred on recruiting and retaining a team with varied professional experience and supplementing it with external expertise as necessary.

# Audit and Risk Committee report continued

# Part 3

We'll continue to monitor the implementation of this strategy through quarterly updates on its progress and milestones from the chief internal auditor being achieved.

In evaluating the work, effectiveness and independence of internal audit, the audit committee drew its own conclusion based on its experience and regular contact with the chief internal auditor, and co-source partner. In addition, the committee reviewed the annual internal audit work plan, received periodic reports on the results of the internal audit work and monitored management's responsiveness to the internal auditor's findings and recommendations.

# Key controls

We continued to monitor the implementation and standardisation of key controls to enhance our internal control environment. A review of the initial set of key controls led to a redefined and expanded set of controls incorporating all functions. The revised controls were progressively implemented during the year and the full set will be operational during the next financial year. With the separation of Airtel Money, an initial set of key controls were also developed and adopted for the mobile money business, and incorporated into the overall key controls programme.

# Automation

Internal audit continued to adopt new technology to improve its effectiveness. We've brought in more extensive and insightful analytics and are using more expansive data to identify key emerging themes and risks.

As well as using enhanced data analytics, we piloted a continuous controls auditing programme for three functions across all 14 markets. This identified an initial set of 65 risk scenarios for the proof-of-concept phase. The programme will be rolled out progressively for all functions across our markets. This will enable us to flag errors and control violations as they happen.

During the next financial year, we'll establish a dedicated data analytics and automation team. The practices of data analytics and continuous auditing will become even more central to our methodology to ensure effective and sustainable auditing and monitoring of controls.

# Part 4

# External auditors

# Engaging our auditor

Our committee manages the Group's relationship with the external auditor. Each year, we assess their performance, effectiveness and independence and recommend their reappointment or removal to the Board.

The Group's external auditor is Deloitte LLP (UK), and the lead partner is Ryan Duffy. He was appointed as the engagement partner for our 2022/23 year after Mark Goodey retired.

# Effectiveness of the external audit process

Our committee makes recommendations to the Board on whether to reappoint the external auditors, their independence from our business, and the scope and fee for the audit. After reviewing and challenging the work done by Deloitte during the year, we approved Deloitte's terms of engagement and are fully satisfied with their performance, objectivity, quality of challenge and independence.

Having reviewed Deloitte's performance in committee, with management and other key stakeholders, our committee recommended to the Board that they be reappointed as our external auditor for the 2023 financial year. The Board will recommend this to shareholders as resolution 19 at our 2023 AGM.

Our committee works in line with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the FRC Guidance on Audit Committees and EU regulations on audit reform for our external audit tendering timetable.

We will continue to follow the annual appointment process until our next competitive tender. In line with current regulations, our next mandatory tender will be in readiness to retain our current auditor or move to a new audit firm for the 2029 financial year. This timetable is subject to an annual assessment of Deloitte's effectiveness and independence. The audit was last subjected to a tender in 2019 when Deloitte were appointed (four years).

Our choice of auditor is not restricted by contractual obligations or a minimum appointment period. We've complied with the provisions of the Competition and Markets Authority's Order for this financial year relating to audit rotation and tendering and the provision of non-audit services.

# Working with our auditor

The lead external audit partner and his team attend our committee meetings to provide insight and challenge and to report on their review of the half year results and audit of the year-end financial statements. To facilitate open dialogue and assurance, we also hold private sessions with our auditor without management present. Our committee chair regularly meets with Deloitte outside of scheduled committee meetings.

A number of external audit teams are involved in the audit, given the need to report both our own financial results and to report to our parent company, Bharti Airtel.

Throughout the year, audit teams deliver:

- An half year review report on Airtel Africa's interim condensed consolidated financial statements by Deloitte UK  
- The audit report on Airtel Africa's consolidated and company only financial statements signed by Deloitte UK  
- Local statutory accounts audited by each Deloitte Africa team, with some work performed by Deloitte India

# Part 4

During its half year and full year results reporting, Deloitte did not report any significant deficiencies in controls or issues with our accounting judgements and estimates.

Our committee receives a detailed audit plan from Deloitte identifying key risks and areas of focus. We review and challenge this external audit plan, including audit scope and materiality, to make sure Deloitte has identified all key risks and developed robust audit procedures and communication plans. We also look at the quality of auditors' reports throughout the year and consider responses to accounting, financial control and audit issues as they arise.

This year we agreed to refine the audit scope into three groups: full scope audits (Scope A), specified account balance audits (Scope B), and review procedures (Scope C). Deloitte visited all Scope A and Scope B OpCos during the year and some Scope C OpCos to meet local management and to perform audit procedures.

# Using our auditor for non-audit services

We safeguard auditor independence and objectivity through a number of control measures, including limiting the nature and value of non-audit services performed by the external auditor.

Where we consider our external auditor to have the most appropriate skills, expertise and safeguards, we may consider using them for certain acceptable non-audit services pursuant to law or regulation or where there are typically significant efficiencies to be had when done in combination with the audit. Their knowledge of our business may make such services more cost effective and ensure confidentiality.

Our non-audit services policy sets out the circumstances in which the external auditor can perform non-audit services. It restricts the provision of non-audit services as prohibited by the FRC Revised Ethical Standard 2019 and provides a monetary threshold for approved services. Our committee reviews and pre-approves any non-audit services with fees above the threshold or not stipulated by the policy.

Under our policy on non-audit services, the CEO and CFO have authority to approve permitted services up to \(50,000, with any amounts above this needing committee approval.

Our review of the auditor's performance during the reporting period included non-audit services and the ability of Deloitte to maintain independence while providing these services. The non-audit services work for the financial year included half year review work for our company, quarterly audits for our parent, Bharti Airtel, non-statutory audit of Airtel Mobile Commerce B.V. financial statements, and control attestation in Zambia required by local regulations, certification of SmartCash Payment Services Bank Limited's customers' deposits required by local regulations in Nigeria, mobile money regulatory reporting required by local regulations in Uganda and Single Electronic Format (ESEF) assurance. The value of this was \(1.9m, representing approximately 31% of Deloitte's total remuneration as set out on page 197, Note 8.1 of the consolidated financial statements.

# Part 5

# Finance Committee

Our Finance Committee is an operational management committee overseen by and subsidiary to our committee. Its two independent non-executive director members are also members of the Audit and Risk Committee.

Given the complexity and importance of finance, treasury and tax policy matters, the Board has delegated oversight and governance to this specialist Finance Committee. This has strengthened our adherence to the relationship agreement and treasury and tax controls. This committee frames our finance policies and procedures, creating risk framework mechanisms for treasury and tax to help achieve our strategic financial goals with a balance of initiative and risk control.

# Committee duties

- Ensures our treasury activities are carried out within an agreed policy framework  
- Makes sure activities are within agreed levels of risk and will contribute to our financial performance through focused management  
- Makes sure operations are appropriately funded and conducted in line with policy  
- Ensures the overall treasury objective and specific objectives for each main treasury activity are consistent with both financial and corporate business objectives  
- Recommends the strategic tax policy for approval by the Board

- Maintains diversified access to various local and global debt and borrowings markets  
- Determines and approves our strategic tax planning policies  
- Approves new debt and the cancellation and modification of borrowing and debt facilities

# Chair's statement

I'm pleased to present the Nominations Committee report for 2022/23 and to share our plans for the coming year.

# Changes to the Board

We continue to make sure our Board members have the necessary drive, abilities, experience and diversity to lead Airtel Africa in delivering on our strategy.

We also continue to regularly monitor succession planning for senior management immediately below the Board to ensure we have a consistent pipeline of diverse talent for progression to the Board. We're working to support and encourage a growing pool of talent potentially suitable for senior roles at Airtel Africa.

2022/23 saw the strengthening of our ExCo with significant changes:

- The recruitment of Anthony Shiner as our new chief commercial officer  
- The appointment of Ian Ferrao as CEO of Airtel Money  
- The promotion of Apoorva Mehrotra to regional director, East Africa We also made some significant senior management appointments: PD Sarma as CEO of FibreCo and Yashnath Issur as CEO of Data Centres.

We're expecting to be able to share news on our appointments of chief information officer and head of strategy and sustainability roles in the near future.

Our work to identify executives with potential and to encourage their development led to several key internal promotions in and across our operating companies this year. As well as Ian and Apoorva, Ashish Malhotra was promoted to managing director for Airtel Kenya Networks Ltd in May 2022. Ashish was previously head of sales and marketing, Africa.

As part of our onboarding and review process, we've supported Segun Ogunsumya as new MD and CEO of Airtel Africa since October 2021 and Jaideep Paul, CFO, since his appointment to the Board as executive director in June 2021. We are pleased with the progress of both.

# Board diversity

Airtel Africa is a multicultural business, and our ethnic diversity is reflected in our Board, our leadership team and our employee mix. We're committed to ensuring diversity in terms of culture, age, gender, ethnicity, length of service and educational background – and will continue to build an inclusive and diverse workplace. We count this as a core strength of our business.

We're privileged to have a Board of directors with a wide diversity of skills, experience, age and nationality to perform their vital role. This is invaluable in developing our business strategy and further enhancing our governance capabilities.

We reviewed the tenure of all directors and discussed future Board rotation as part of our ongoing review of the Board's current and future needs. Our Board is not yet gender balanced, despite including four women. We foresee this imbalance being corrected through our Board succession plans and retirement and rotation over the next 12 months.

As you can see from their biographies on pages 102-105, our committee chairs and members have recent and relevant skills, experience and expertise.

# Employee engagement

As the non-executive director with responsibility for engaging with our employees, I was delighted to be able to join several employee events during the year to hear and respond to questions and listen to people's stories. This included the leadership conclave in February 2023, when I met with over 200 colleagues, both informally and formally. I have shared the outcomes of this with the Board and the senior management team, as relevant. Our independent non-executive directors are also invited to all-employee quarterly town halls where they can take questions and provide answers.

Given my extensive travel to our operating companies throughout the year, the Board considers my role as non-executive director with responsibility for engaging with employees to be an effective engagement mechanism. The Board intends to review how we can both collectively and individually enhance engagement with our people during the coming year.

# Evaluating our Board

As part of our corporate governance review each year, we examine the independence and diversity of our Board and the balance of skills and development needs of members.

We regularly map the skillsets of our Board members against our current strategy and annual operating plan. We confirmed that collectively our non-executive directors have significant experience across the critical areas of strategy, risk management, M&A, technology, media and telecoms (TMT) and Africa.

I welcome questions from shareholders on this committee's activities. If you would like to discuss any aspect of this report, please contact me through our company secretary, Simon O'Hara (see page 127 for contact details). I will be attending the 2023 AGM and look forward to the opportunity to meet you and answer your questions there.

# Sunil Bharti Mittal

Chair, Nominations Committee

10 May 2023

# About the committee

Led by the chair of our Board, our committee consists of independent non-executive directors. Our CEO and chief HR officer are also invited to attend committee meetings and submit reports.

We met formally three times during the 2022/23 financial year. Our focus, driven by a more ambitious strategic agenda and the planned separation of Airtel Money, was on longer-term succession planning for the senior executive team, short-term senior leadership changes, and supporting the CEO on his proposal to restructure our Executive Committee (ExCo). Improving the gender balance at senior leadership level across our business, including in our HQ and OpCos, remained fundamentally important.

Having reviewed the composition and performance of the Board and its committees, we believe our Board has the experience, expertise and appetite for challenge to take Airtel Africa forward in line with our strategy while maintaining good governance. We keep this under regular review.

# The committee's work and focus in 2022/23

- Reviewed the Board's composition, balance, diversity, skill sets, individual directors' time commitment and overall effectiveness against future needs

# Developing our Board

The ongoing development of our Board members is a priority. We inform directors about relevant seminars and training and encourage and support their attendance. We provide regulatory updates at each Board meeting; and specialist advisers brief our committees on topics such as changes to accounting procedures and UK corporate governance. Our Board undertook a series of development activities during the reporting period, including training provided by our corporate legal advisers Herbert Smith Freehills LLP on the political environment, governance reform, liability to investors and directors' duties.

We also reviewed the induction programme for directors and concluded that this is appropriate.

# Employee engagement

Our Board engages with employees in various ways to understand how we can enhance our people strategy and continue to bring our values to life. To understand the business at all levels, directors are encouraged to engage with local operations, either by visiting in person or through online meetings, strategy sessions and quarterly reports from our HR Committee. We arrange visits each year to operations, either individually or in small groups – with representatives from the business present. This year, two of our Board and committee programmes once again took place in Dubai and were attended by many senior colleagues. These created opportunities for employees at all levels to discuss both professional and personal matters.

The Board stays on top of employee-related issues through:

- Our open-door policy, where employees can connect directly with our CEO or any ExCo director about anything  
- Quarterly CEO-led town halls in English and French, where senior executives update employees on our business performance, organisational changes and take questions from employees  
- Remuneration Committee updates on remuneration, people, culture, conduct and diversity  
- Quarterly presentations and one-to-one meetings as necessary from our chief HR officer  
- Quarterly reports from the HR Forum and Remuneration Forum chair to the Remuneration Committee on people, culture and wellbeing  
- The results of our employee engagement survey and regular pulses shared in various OpCos and OpCo-led town halls  
- One-to-one meetings between our ExCo and OpCo MDs and other leaders to discuss employee and personal wellbeing, team updates and career aspirations  
- Regular ExCo market visits where leaders interact with teams at all levels of the business

Sunil Bharti Mittal is our designated Board director for employee engagement, given his regular travel to our operating companies. In this role, he is not expected to take on the responsibilities of an executive director or the Chief HR officer.

He is responsible for supporting directors' collective responsibility to consider a wide range of stakeholder perspectives when making Board decisions, including:

- Understanding the concerns of the workforce and articulating their views and concerns in Board meetings  
- Ensuring that the Board, particularly executive directors, take appropriate steps to evaluate the impact of proposals and developments on the workforce  
- Where relevant and appropriate, providing feedback to the workforce on Board decisions and direction during the engagement process  
- Making sure that feedback is gathered from all levels of the workforce in various locations

Each of our non-executive directors is invited to attend all quarterly employee town halls to hear feedback from employees and is encouraged to engage directly with employees when the opportunity arises. Feedback can then be shared immediately with the company secretary or chief HR officer, or with the Board at its next meeting.

In 2023, we'll continue to identify and create mechanisms for effective and meaningful dialogue with our broad employee base.

For more on how we engaged with our people during the reporting period, see page 79.

# Employee development and engagement

During the year, our Board stayed up to date on projects to accelerate talent acquisition and to support and keep our own employees. These included:

- Our Women in Tech programme – a one-year developmental immersive programme targeting over 70 high-performing women employees in tech or engineering  
- The young technology leaders 2022 training programme and set-up of Nigeria Digital Labs, both of which offer engineering employment opportunities  
- The Airtel Africa Mobility Programme – a women-focused framework to support talent development and succession planning, which will create the opportunity to spend months in other OpCos  
- The rollout of online learning programmes for capability building and functional training, as well as for key competency areas like management effectiveness and project management  
- The rollout of mandatory compliance training across the Group

# Board and committee balance, diversity, independence and effectiveness

The chair of the Board is responsible for making sure independent non-executive directors can constructively challenge executive directors, while supporting them to implement the strategy and run the business effectively. He works with our committee to make sure the Board has the right blend of skills, independence and knowledge.

# Appointing and re-electing directors

# Our appointment processes

The Board has the power to appoint additional directors or to fill any vacancy. When recruiting new members for the Board, our committee adopts a formal and transparent procedure – this considers the skills, knowledge and level of experience required, as well as diversity.

We begin by evaluating the balance of skills, knowledge and experience of existing Board members, the diversity of the Board, and ongoing requirements and strategic developments of the business.

This enables us to focus our search process on appointing someone who will complement and enhance the Board's effectiveness and overall performance.

We review a long list of globally drawn potential candidates and shortlist candidates for interview based on the objective criteria set out in the agreed specification. These include the requirements of the Group, the diversity of the Board, and the skills, knowledge and experience of current members. Non-executive appointees must be able to show they have time available to devote to the role, and before being appointed all candidates must identify any potential conflicts of interest.

Shortlisted candidates are interviewed by the committee chair, other committee members and the CEO. The committee then recommends the preferred candidate, who is invited to meet other Board members. Finally, the committee takes up detailed external references before making a formal recommendation to the Board for appointment.

There were no Board changes in 2022/23.

No director took on a significant new appointment during the year. Before accepting any appointment, each director is expected to discuss the anticipated time commitment with our chair and company secretary to make sure they continue to have adequate time for Airtel Africa Board duties.

# Re-election

All directors will stand for re-election at each year's AGM while in office. Each director proposed for re-election at our AGM has been unanimously recommended by other members of the Board. More information on our appointments process is on page 131.

# Effectiveness

The internal Board evaluation reviewed our committee's effectiveness and sought feedback from the committee members. We discussed the output of the evaluation, which concluded that we continued to operate effectively throughout the year and confirmed our intended areas of focus for the year ahead.

<table><tr><td>2022-23 evaluation</td><td>Outcome</td><td>Key themes and areas for focus</td><td>Action</td></tr><tr><td>Nominations Committee</td><td>Areas of focus</td><td>Priorities for change</td><td>We will focus on our Board and executive succession planning to ensure greater gender diversity.</td></tr></table>

Areas of challenge are identified throughout this report.

Each director goes through a performance review process as part of the annual Board effectiveness review. This confirmed that each director continues to make an effective contribution to the Board.

# Advice available to the Board

All directors have access to the advice and services of the company secretary. Directors may also take independent professional advice at our expense where this is judged necessary to fulfil their responsibilities. During the year, the Board took advice from:

- Alvarez & Marsal through the Remuneration Committee, as explained in more detail on page 162  
- Herbert Smith Freehills LLP, our corporate legal advisers, through the Market Disclosure Committee on the identification of insider information  
- Legal advisers Clifford Chance on share plan and remuneration policy matters  
- Our brokers on the sector and the relative performance of our share price

# Nominations Committee report continued

# Diversity

We see diversity as fundamental to the successful operation of our Board and to creating a balanced culture across our business. The Board represents a broad range of skills, experience, age, education, social background, ethnicity, gender and nationality. Our youngest director is 34, and the Group is ethnically diverse. Most have spent a considerable amount of time living outside the UK, and this range of experience is invaluable in developing our business strategy and enhancing our governance capabilities.

Our policy is to appoint and promote the best person for each role without regard to age, ethnicity or disability – only considering factors such as educational and professional backgrounds as appropriate for the position. This applies to the entire business, including the Board. We're working to build diversity into our appointment and promotion processes at every level. All Airtel Africa employees have completed our annual Code of Conduct training and certification, which covers our commitments on diversity, inclusion and anti-discrimination.

The Board regularly reviews its balance and composition considering targets and recommendations for gender diversity, as well as the Parker Review and its report into ethnic diversity. We've gone far beyond the Parker Review target for FTSE 250 boards to have at least one director from an ethnic minority background by 2024. We also fully endorse to increase senior leadership diversity, including its listing rule requirement target of  $40\%$  women on Board, Executive Committee and senior management teams. As part of this review the Committee considered the Group's ongoing compliance with the Board diversity policy and the new Listing Rule Disclosure as at 31 March 2023 requirement, pursuant to which at least one woman should be

appointed as chair or senior independent director on the Board or as either our CEO or finance director by the end of 2025. The Board is not currently compliant with these two Listing Rule targets.

As at 31 March 2023, women made up  $31\%$  of the directors and there were no woman in senior Board positions. Of our directors,  $62\%$  identified as being from a non-white or minority-white background. This represented no change in the Board's gender and ethnic diversity compared to 31 March 2022. We are compliant with the Listing Rule target of having one individual on the Board of directors from a minority ethnic background.

While we haven't yet achieved the FTSE Women Leaders Review's Board level gender-balance target, its attainment is an integral part of our succession planning. Our two most recent Board appointments have been women, and this number will increase as Board members retire and we appoint new directors.

Gender diversity in our Group level Executive Committee remains a challenge. We're working to increase the number of women at this level by 2026. We are making considerable strides in addressing the gender imbalance at our OpCo Executive Committee level and in our senior management teams who report to the ExCo. For more on this see below.

We're making sure the specification for any new senior management role is equally suited to applicants of any gender and that there's no discrimination at any stage in the selection process based on applicant characteristics. Diversity and inclusion are, and will continue to be, a key focus for Airtel Africa.

# Gender balance

# 66

Achieving our corporate governance and transparency in reporting goals is a shared ambition of all the teams at Airtel Africa.

# 99

As Airtel Africa plc ordinary shares have been trading on the main market of the London Stock Exchange since 3 July 2019, we apply the principles and provisions of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code) and explain any non-compliance. (See the Code at frc.org.uk.) While we have a secondary listing on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NGX), we're permitted by NGX listings requirements to follow the corporate governance practices of our primary listing market in London.

The UK Financial Reporting Council (FRC) promotes high-quality corporate governance and reporting through the Code. All companies with a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange must either comply in full or explain why and to what extent they don't yet comply.

Throughout the year ended 31 March 2023, we've applied the principles and complied with the provisions set out in the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code except for in the area: Provision 9, requiring that the chair be independent on appointment.

# 1. Board leadership and company purpose

# A. An effective and entrepreneurial board

Our Board is responsible for Airtel Africa's system of corporate governance. As such, directors are committed to developing and maintaining high standards of governance that reflect evolving good practice.

The Board provides strategic and entrepreneurial leadership within a framework of strong governance, effective controls and an open and transparent culture. This enables opportunities and risks to be assessed and managed appropriately. Our Board also sets our strategic aims and risk appetite, makes sure we have the financial and human resources in place to meet our objectives, and monitors our compliance and performance against our targets. And finally, the Board ensures we engage effectively with all our stakeholders and considers their views in setting our strategic priorities.

# Roles and responsibilities

We have well-documented roles and responsibilities for directors, and a clear division of key responsibilities between our chair and CEO to help maintain a strong governance framework and the effectiveness of our Board. Our clearly defined policies, processes and procedures govern all areas of the business. These will continue to be reviewed and refined to meet business requirements and changing market circumstances.

We re-examine budgets considering business forecasts throughout the year to make sure they're robust enough to reflect the possible impact of changing economic conditions and circumstances. We conduct regular reviews of actual results and future projections compared with the budget and prior year results, as well as with various treasury reports. We monitor any disputes that could lead to significant litigation or contractual claims at each Board meeting, with updates provided by the CEO and CFO as part of their reports or tabled by the company secretary.

We have a Board-approved framework of delegated authority to identify and monitor individual responsibilities of senior executives.

# B. Purpose, values and strategy and alignment with culture

Our purpose is to transform the lives of people across sub-Saharan Africa. We do this through products, services and programmes that foster financial inclusion, drive digitisation and empower our 140 million customers and the communities in which they live. To continue to serve our vision of enriching the lives of our customers, we have a clear business objective: to grow market share profitably and create superior enterprise value while delivering our sustainability strategy.

We provide essential services that are unlocking the potential for people and economies to grow. The Board sets the strategy for aligning with our purpose. Our 'Win with' strategy ensures that working to deliver our sustainability strategy underpins everything we do.

Our Board believes that a healthy culture, which drives the right behaviours, protects and generates value and helps employees engage with our values, will lead to the successful delivery of our strategy. It is responsible for defining our values and setting clear standards from the top. Our chair leads the way by ensuring our Board operates correctly and with a clear culture of its own which can be promoted to our wider operations and dealings with all stakeholders. Our CEO, with the help of the CFO and his management team, is responsible for the culture within our wider operations. We've continued to build our people capability through:

Enhancing our online learning platform for greater access  
- Encouraging skills development through short-term assignments and exchanges between operating companies  
- Mentoring  
- Ensuring all employees have mandatory training in compliance areas such as our Code of Conduct, anti-bribery and corruption, and information security

The Board receives regular reports that allow it to assess our culture to ensure this continues to support our strategy and purpose. Our Audit and Risk Committee reviewed the culture of compliance and arranged a presentation facilitated by Deloitte UK. As a result of this, our chief internal auditor was instructed to establish a robust reporting framework for assessing and monitoring culture on an ongoing basis and to include these findings in the quarterly internal audit report to the Audit and Risk Committee, for subsequent sharing with the Board. Our Remuneration Committee helps our Board oversee our culture by making sure our incentivisation schemes are driving behaviours consistent with our purpose, values, strategy and culture; and through its focus on diversity and inclusion, people and community engagement. The committee tracks performance in these areas and reports to the Board as appropriate.

These reports have led to Board discussions on matters ranging from gender balance metrics across the business to how to achieve wider workforce engagement. In both instances, the Board recommended changes to be able to satisfy itself that policy, practices and behaviours throughout the business were aligned with our purpose, values and strategy.

Annika Poutiainen is the Board sustainability champion, supported by the CEO, CFO and company secretary as fellow committee members. She reports to each Board meeting on the work of the Sustainability Committee. This committee, which became a full committee of the Board at the beginning of the financial year, meets monthly and receives occupational health and safety updates at each meeting.

Our chief HR officer regularly attends Board meetings and all Remuneration Committee meetings to provide updates on HR matters – including on culture, diversity and inclusion, talent acquisition and retention and employee engagement. The chair of the Remuneration Committee also includes these matters in his own report to the Board.

While our leadership establishes our culture and leads by example, our clear policies and Code of Conduct ensure that our obligations to shareholders and other stakeholders are clearly understood and met, as described in more detail on pages 37 and 77.

# C. Company performance and risk management

Our CEO manages the Group's business in line with the strategic plan and approved risk appetite and takes responsibility for the operation of the internal control framework. Our Audit and Risk Committee oversees potential risks and provides the Board with strategic advice on current and potential future risk exposures. Our risk management framework supports informed risk-taking by our businesses, setting out the risks that we're prepared to be exposed to and the risks that we want to avoid.

>> More information on risk management can be found on page 90 and on page 222, note 32

# D. Stakeholder engagement

Our Board members are increasingly taking a more active role in engaging with shareholders and wider stakeholders and addressing their concerns. This is in keeping with our sustainability strategy, which addresses stakeholder concerns as advised by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), and the ongoing development of our remuneration policy. Our director induction process includes directors' duties under section 172 of the Companies Act 2006.

The Board regularly receives feedback on shareholder sentiment and sell-side analysts' views of our business and the wider industry. Our investor relations team and management have frequent contact with the 12 active equity research analysts who follow Airtel Africa.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/b466c5e8-a974-4f7e-87ee-1dc562965b0e/f156997fc72b3bb7835d01f9cb8b124c461e88bdb3ee31431c3208ba89d43f88.jpg)  
Our culture

# Our compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code continued

Our Board discusses the impact of all major decisions on our workforce before drawing its conclusion. We also consider stakeholder impact in relation to material acquisitions and strategic expansion. While we're working to better embed stakeholder considerations in Board decision-making, we do factor the needs and concerns of our stakeholders into Board discussions and decisions in accordance with section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 (see statement on page 77).

Sunil Bharti Mittal is our designated Board director for employee engagement, given his regular travel to our operating companies.

We continue to seek to identify and facilitate mechanisms for more effective and meaningful dialogue with our people.

# E. Workforce policies and practices

We expect all businesses and employees to work with the highest standards of integrity and conduct at all times. Our Code of Conduct, which can be found on our website, sets out our expectations in detail. We also have policies focused on anti-bribery and corruption, whistleblowing and data protection (GDPR) setting out the ethical framework that all companies and employees are expected to follow. Each year, our employees receive up-to-date training on legislative and regulatory matters.

Our management processes and divisions of responsibility are detailed in the following documents, which can be seen on our website:

- Schedule of matters reserved for Board decisions, including profit expectations and dividend policy  
- Terms of reference for Audit and Risk, Nominations, Sustainability and Remuneration Committees  
- Policies covering operational, compliance, corporate responsibility and stakeholder matters, including ones related to the Bribery Act 2010 and anti-corruption – these are updated as necessary in line with developments in corporate governance and legislation  
- Our Articles of Association

Our policies are reported on to the Board and Audit and Risk Committee by our head of internal audit and risk assurance, chief compliance officer or Group company secretary.

A description of our whistleblowing procedures is set out on page 125.

# 2. Division of responsibilities

# F. Role of the chair

The roles and responsibilities of the chair and CEO have been clearly defined, set out in writing and signed by Sunil Bharti Mittal and Olusegun Ogunsanya.

The chair leads our Board and is responsible for its overall effectiveness in directing the company.

Our chair and the senior independent director hold separate meetings at least once a year with non-executive directors without the CEO present. Each did this once during the 2022/23 reporting period. Led by the senior independent director, the non-executive directors also meet at least once during the year without the chair to appraise his performance. The chair also meets formally with independent non-executive directors without our CEO or other non-executive directors present. Through these meetings, the chair ensures we maintain a fair and open culture where all Board members can make a strong contribution.

The Board is aware that Sunil Bharti Mittal did not meet the independence criteria of the Code when he was appointed due to his interests in the company. Considering his extensive involvement with the Bharti Airtel Group over many years and his major contribution to Airtel Africa's growth, the Board unanimously agrees that his continued involvement is crucially important to our ongoing success. We have a number of safeguards in place to ensure robust corporate governance during his tenure as chair, including Andrew Green in position as a strong senior independent director.

The Board believes Sunil Bharti Mittal continues to effectively oversee our leadership and maintain a balanced shareholder agenda.

# G. Composition of the Board and division of responsibilities

Our Board consists of 13 directors: non-executive chair Sunil Bharti Mittal, who is not independent, CEO Segun Ogunsanya, CFO Jaideep Paul, seven independent non-executive directors and three nonexecutive directors. Andrew Green, CBE, is the senior independent director and Simon O'Hara is our Group company secretary. For more on our Board composition, see pages 102-105.

The Board has an established framework of delegated financial, commercial and operational authorities which define the scope and powers of the CEO and of operational management.

For more on our Board and executive roles, see pages 102-107

# H. Role of non-executive directors

Our independent non-executive directors offer advice and guidance to the CEO and CFO, drawing on their wide experience in business and diverse backgrounds. They also provide constructive challenge and hold management to account – monitoring the overall direction and strategy of the company, scrutinising the performance of the CEO and CFO, and ensuring the integrity of the financial information made available to the Board and our shareholders. They play an important part in general succession planning for the Board and other executive and senior management positions.

The senior independent director and the independent directors also play a critical role in fulfilling the requirements of the separation governance framework and ensuring Airtel Africa's independence.

Following their appointment, each of our non-executive directors (both independent and non-independent) received an induction that focused on the culture, operational structure and key challenges of Airtel Africa.

# I. Board processes and role of the company secretary

We have a range of processes in place to make sure our Board is fully informed in a timely manner to be able to perform its duties. Directors receive papers before each Board and committee meeting. This allows them to prepare for meetings and to send in their views if unable to attend.

The CEO sends updates to members on important issues between meetings. Members also receive a monthly report on key financial and management information, as well as regular updates on shareholder issues and analysts' notes. This information is distributed through a secure online portal.

All directors have direct access to the advice and services of the Group company secretary. And non-executive directors can take independent legal advice at our expense when necessary to fulfil their duties to the company.

We take time at the end of each Board meeting to review our Board and committee processes and to build on actions introduced as a result of the annual evaluation exercise. Coordinated by the Group company secretary and led by the chair, we consider feedback from Board members to improve our efficiency.

# 3. Composition, succession and evaluation

# J. Board appointments

As part of our 2022/23 Board evaluation, we reaffirmed that each of our independent non-executive directors is independent in character and that there are no relationships which could affect their judgement.

The main objective of our Nominations Committee is to make sure we have the best possible leadership team by overseeing a formal and rigorous and transparent process for appointing and removing directors to or from the Board, our committees and other senior roles. The committee also works to improve diversity and develop our succession-planning processes. During the reporting period, no new directors were appointed to the Board.

For more on our Nominations Committee's activities and processes, see pages 128-133

# K. Skills, experience and knowledge of the Board and its committees

We have an engaged and diverse Board who reflect the cultural and ethnic diversity of the countries in which we operate. Our Board members bring a range of practical experience and deep expertise to our business – and at least half of our directors, excluding the chair, are independent non-executive directors, in line with the Code's recommendations.

The Board considers that each director brings relevant and complementary skills, experience and background to the Board, details of which are set out in the biographies on pages 102-105.

# L. Board evaluation

As part of good governance, it's important to make sure our Board as a whole, its committees and each director is operating and performing effectively. The Code requires an externally facilitated evaluation at least every three years. We have chosen to do this in each of the three previous years since listing to enable us to plan effectively for the future. This year we have undertaken an anonymised internally facilitated evaluation under the direction of the company secretary.

>> See page 116 for details

# 4. Audit, risk and internal control

# M. Independence and effectiveness of internal and external audit

Each year, our Audit and Risk Committee identifies the key risks to be reviewed and assessed by Internal Audit as part of its programme of work to enhance our control environment; and satisfies itself as to the policies and procedures that ensure the independence and effectiveness of internal and external audit functions and satisfies on the integrity of financial and narrative statements.

During 2022/23, Deloitte UK performed an external statutory audit of year ended 31 March 2023, and a half-yearly review. See page 126 for a discussion of their independence and effectiveness.

For more on the activities and processes of our Audit and Risk Committee, see pages 117-127

# N. Fair, balanced and understandable assessment

Pages 17-19, 24-25, 26-37, 90-97 of the strategic report set out our performance, business model and strategy, as well as the risks and uncertainties relating to the company's future prospects. When taken as a whole, the directors consider this Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable and provides information necessary for shareholders to assess our performance, business model and strategy.

For more on the Audit and Risk Committee's assessment of fair, balanced and reasonable see page 122

# O. Risk management, internal control and determining principal risks

As highlighted in the strategy and risk sections of the strategic report, risk management is inherent to our management thinking and business planning processes. The Board has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining our risk management and internal control systems. Our Audit and Risk Committee supports the Board in reviewing the effectiveness of our internal controls, including financial, operational and compliance, and risk management systems.

For more on the activities and processes of this committee, see pages 117-127

# 5. Remuneration

# P. Remuneration policies and practices

Our proposed policy is intended to attract, motivate and retain high-calibre directors, to promote the long-term success of Airtel Africa, and to be in line with best practice and the interests of our stakeholders. There are two key principles of our remuneration policy. One, the structure of remuneration packages and the design of performance-based schemes, should be aligned with stakeholders' interests and support our business strategy and objectives. And two, the performance-based element of remuneration should be appropriately balanced between the achievement of short-term objectives and longer-term objectives.

Our current Remuneration Policy was originally introduced at the 2020 AGM. It was designed to be appropriate for a newly listed company in the UK while taking account of our very specific circumstances: being listed on the LSE with a secondary listing on the Nigerian Stock Exchange and operating in 14 countries in Africa.

In 2022, changes were made to the remuneration policy to incorporate best practice features and reflect the appointment of a new CEO and CFO in line with current good practice. The committee decided to adapt the policy in two areas: requiring one-third of any bonus paid to executive directors to be deferred (rather than any bonus of more than  $100\%$  of salary) and introducing a two-year post-employment holding period. No changes were made to policy maximum pay levels. These changes were supported by shareholders at the 2022 AGM.

# Provision 41: engagement with the workforce

Airtel engages with employees on a number of issues, including remuneration, in a variety of ways. For example, the designated non-executive director for employee engagement holds regular meetings with employees when he visits sites throughout the year, and Board members when they visit markets during any year hold engagement sessions with the workforce. Through these meetings and engagement, our board members inform employees on executive remuneration and receive feedback. This engagement approach is kept under review as we continually seek to improve the Board's dialogue with employees.

The topic of engaging with our people forms part of the chief HR officer's report to each Board meeting.

# Our compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code continued

Copies of our Annual Report detailing the executive directors' remuneration are widely shared and available for employees to see on our website.

During our annual strategy meeting and Q3'23 Board and Committee meetings in Dubai, UAE, the Board met both formally and informally with our wider management team and other colleagues when questions were asked. A similar opportunity is offered to employees attending the Q&A session following each quarterly Group-wide town hall meeting. The Board is satisfied that we're compliant with Provision 41.

>> See page 137 for details

# Q. Procedure for developing remuneration policy

The committee regularly reviews our policy to ensure that it operates as intended, is in line with best practice and is aligned to our evolving business strategy. The committee has decided to put the policy to a shareholder vote at the AGM later this year. The policy differs from the previous shareholder-approved policy in these key areas:

- A reduction in the CFO's maximum annual bonus opportunity  
- An increase in the LTIP opportunity allowable to provide headroom for larger award sizes over the next three years if Airtel Africa continues to deliver high levels of growth  
A cap on RSU opportunity of  $50\%$  of base salary  
- The introduction of a facility for one-off awards linked to key strategic initiatives

# R. Exercising independent judgement

In the year ended 31 March 2023, Alvarez & Marsal provided remuneration advice and benchmarking data, and Clifford Chance provided legal advice in relation to share plan matters and remuneration advice to our Remuneration Committee.

The committee uses its discretion, within the maximum policy limits, to consider the target bonus taking account of market development opportunities, specific events and evolving roles. While the committee has the discretion to change the metrics and weighting for the bonus plan from year to year, we normally consult with major shareholders before making any significant changes.

See our remuneration report on pages 145-163 for more detail

# Directors

The names of our current directors, along with their biographical details, are set out on pages 102-105 and are incorporated into this report by reference. Directors serving during the year are listed on page 115.

Details of directors' interests in our share capital are in our remuneration report on page 158.

Our Articles of Association govern the appointment, removal and replacement of our directors and explain the powers given to them.

# Avoiding conflicts of interest

The Board regularly reviews each director's interests outside Airtel Africa and considers how the chair ensures he is applying objective judgement in his role, as required by the UK Corporate Governance Code. To help directors avoid conflicts (or possible conflicts) of interest, the Board must first give clearance to any potential conflicts, including directorships or other interests in outside companies and organisations. This is recorded in a statutory register kept for this purpose.

If a director considers they are, or might be, interested in any contract or arrangement in which the company is or may be involved, they must give notice to the Board in line with the Companies Act 2006 and our Articles of Association. In this instance, unless allowed by the articles, the director cannot take part in any discussions or decisions about the contract or arrangement.

# Articles of Association

The Articles of Association can be amended in line with the Companies Act 2006 through a special shareholder resolution. The information below sets out the provisions in the Articles of Association in place at the date of this report.

# Directors' report continued

# Share capital and control

We have two classes of shares:

1. Ordinary shares of \(0.50 - each carries the right to one vote at our general meetings and other rights and obligations as set out below.  
2. Deferred shares – these carry no voting rights.

Following the conclusion of our AGM, Airtel Africa intends to apply its authority to purchase all deferred shares from their holders before proceeding to cancel the shares.

Details of our share capital movement during the year are set out in the consolidated statement of changes in equity on page 176.

# Rights of members

There are no restrictions on the size of a holding, the exercise of voting rights, or the transfer of shares. The directors are not aware of any agreements between shareholders that might restrict the transfer of shares or voting rights.

# Share plans and rights under the employee share scheme

We operate an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) for some employee share plans. The trustees of the EBT have all rights attached to Airtel Africa shares unless specifically restricted in the plan's governing document. Under these plans, we can satisfy entitlements by acquiring existing shares or issuing new shares. Existing shares are held in the trust. The trustee purchases shares in the open market as required to enable us to issue shares to satisfy awards that vest. The trustee does not register votes in respect of these shares at our AGMs and has waived the right to receive any dividends. At 31 March 2023, the EBT held 7,326,058 ordinary Airtel Africa shares. During the year, the EBT transferred 3,933,952 shares to satisfy the vesting of awards under our share-based incentive plans.

# Purchase of own shares

The articles do not prevent Airtel Africa from purchasing its own shares. No one person has any rights of control over our share capital and all issued shares are fully paid.

# Major shareholders

Major shareholders have the same voting rights as other shareholders. We publish information given to us by substantial shareholders through the regulatory information service and on our website www.airtel.africa, in line with the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules. At 31 March 2023, we had been notified, in keeping with Rule 5, of the following holdings of ordinary share voting rights $^{2}$ :

<table><tr><td>Shareholder</td><td>Number of voting rights</td><td>% of capital1</td></tr><tr><td>Airtel Africa Mauritius Limited</td><td>2,105,108,805</td><td>56.01</td></tr><tr><td>Indian Continent Investment Limited</td><td>292,424,330</td><td>7.78</td></tr><tr><td>Singapore Telecom International Pte Ltd</td><td>148,093,705</td><td>3.94</td></tr><tr><td>Warburg Pincus LLC</td><td>145,212,068</td><td>3.86</td></tr><tr><td>Qatar Holding LLC</td><td>134,726,964</td><td>3.58</td></tr><tr><td>Bharti Global Limited</td><td>127,147,531</td><td>3.38</td></tr></table>

1  $\%$  interest in voting rights attaching to issued shares.  
2 The company has not received any notifications in accordance with DTR5 from 1 April 2023 to the date of this Annual Report.

# Significant agreements (change of control)

Airtel Africa's borrowing and bank facilities contain the usual provisions which could potentially lead to prepayment and cancellation by the other party if there's a change of company control. There are no other significant contracts or agreements that would take effect, change or come to an end on a change of control following a takeover bid. All our share plans contain provisions for a change of control as summarised in the directors' remuneration report on page 153.

We do not have agreements with any director or employee that would compensate for loss of office or employment resulting from a takeover bid.

# Airtel Mobile Commerce BV (AMC BV)

AMC BV, a wholly owned subsidiary of Airtel Africa, is currently the holding company for several of Airtel Africa's mobile money operations. It is intended to own and operate the mobile money businesses across all of Airtel Africa's 14 operating countries once the inclusion of the remaining mobile money operations under AMC BV is completed.

Airtel Africa plc has sold minority equity stakes in AMC BV to four investors.

Airtel Africa aims to explore the potential listing of the mobile money business within four years of the announcement to do so made in March 2021. Under the terms of the transaction with the four minority stakeholders, the minority investors have the option to sell their shares in AMC BV to Airtel Africa or its affiliates in very limited circumstances: if there's no Initial Public Offering of shares in AMC BV within four years of first close, or if there are changes of control without prior approval. This sale would be made to provide liquidity to the minority investors and would be at fair market value, determined by a mutually agreed merchant bank using an agreed internationally accepted valuation methodology. The option is subject to a minimum price equal to the consideration paid by the investors for their investment (less the value of all distributions and any proceeds of sale of the shares, and with no time value of money or minimum built in) and a maximum number of shares in AMC BV.

# Relationship agreement

In accordance with the Listing Rules, Airtel Africa entered into a relationship agreement with Bharti Airtel, Airtel Africa Mauritius Limited (AAML), our majority shareholder and an indirect subsidiary of Bharti Airtel, and Bharti Telecom on 17 June 2019. This agreement regulates the ongoing relationship and ensures that transactions and arrangements between parties are conducted at arm's length and on normal commercial terms. It also contains the independence undertakings and provisions required by the Listing Rules. During the financial year, Airtel Africa has complied with the terms and provisions of the relationship agreement.

# Board and meeting participation

As long as Bharti Airtel and/or AAML are a controlling shareholder, Board meetings and certain committee meetings must include a non-executive director nominated by Bharti and/or AAML (subject to certain exemptions) to be valid (quorate). Each Board and committee meeting must include three directors including two independent directors to be valid.

As long as Bharti Airtel and/or AAML and their associates hold (directly or indirectly) ordinary shares in Airtel Africa, they are entitled to appoint non-executive directors to the Board as follows:

One non-executive director for  $10\%$  or more interest in the ordinary shares  
- Two non-executive directors for  $15\%$  or more interest in the ordinary shares

For every  $10\%$  or more interest (directly or indirectly) in the ordinary shares above  $15\%$  in aggregate, Bharti Airtel and/or AAML can nominate one additional non-executive director to the Board, up to a maximum of four directors. Independent non-executive directors must form the majority of the Board.

Similarly, as long as Bharti Airtel and/or AAML and Bharti Telecom and their associates have a  $10\%$  or more interest in Airtel Africa ordinary shares, each can appoint one observer (who must be a director) to attend meetings of the Audit and Risk Committee and Remuneration Committee. This observer can attend and speak at meetings but does not count towards quorum or have a right to vote. As such, Akhil Gupta attends the Audit and Risk Committee meetings, and Shravin Bharti Mittal attends the Remuneration Committee meetings.

# Directors' report continued

# Other provisions

The agreement provides that Airtel Africa will not make any market purchases that would cause Bharti or Bharti Telecom to have to make a mandatory offer under Rule 9 of the Takeover Code, unless Airtel Africa has the necessary consents and waivers to prevent a mandatory offer obligation.

Amendments can only be made to this relationship agreement in writing and with the recommendation of a majority of the independent directors. The relationship agreement will come to an end upon the earlier of:

- Ordinary shares of Airtel Africa no longer being listed on the premium listing segment and traded on the London Stock Exchange (LSE)  
- Bharti Airtel, AAML and Bharti Telecom, together with their associates, ceasing to be interested (directly or indirectly in aggregate) in at least  $10\%$  of issued ordinary shares

The relationship agreement will terminate upon the shares ceasing to be listed on the LSE's main market or the principal shareholders and their associates ceasing to hold at least  $10\%$  of the issued shares.

We believe that the terms of this relationship agreement enable Airtel Africa to carry out its business independently of Bharti Airtel, AAML and Bharti Telecom.

# Services agreement

Bharti Airtel provides services to Airtel Africa and its subsidiaries including Bharti Airtel International (Netherlands) B.V. (BAIN) under a services agreement.

# Provision of information

To provide services to Airtel Africa under the services agreement, Bharti Airtel will have access to information related to the Airtel Africa Group which may include sensitive or confidential information. Bharti Airtel will ensure its affiliates comply with the terms of the information flow protocol to the extent that it is legally able to do so. Airtel Africa will provide Bharti Airtel with service-related information necessary for it to provide services under the agreement.

# Future developments

The strategic report contains details of likely future developments within Airtel Africa.

# Group policy compliance

Each Group policy is owned by a member of the Executive Committee to ensure clear accountability and the authority to make sure the associated business risk is adequately managed. The senior leadership team member responsible for each Group function has primary accountability for ensuring compliance with all Group policies by all our markets and entities. Our Group compliance team supports the policy owners and local markets in implementing policies and monitoring compliance. All of the key Group policies have been consolidated into our Code of Conduct which applies to all employees and those who work for or on behalf of Airtel Africa. It sets out the standards of behaviour expected in relation to areas such as insider dealing, bribery, and raising concerns through our whistleblowering process.

# Directors' indemnities

We have agreed to indemnify directors for certain losses and liabilities in connection with their duties, powers and office. Qualifying third-party indemnity provisions (as defined by section 234 of the Companies Act 2006) were in force during the financial year ended 31 March 2023. We also hold liability insurance covering our directors for any legal action against them. We took legal advice on this subject.

# Branch and representative offices

Airtel Africa Services (UK) Limited has an office in Dubai, UAE. We were issued a commercial licence in Dubai on 30 September 2021 with number 99099.

Bharti Airtel International (Netherlands) B.V. has a branch office in Nairobi, Kenya. It was issued a certificate of compliance on 7 October 2010 with number CF/2010/33117.

# Anti-bribery and anti-corruption

In line with the Bribery Act 2010, we have written policies on avoiding and not tolerating bribery or corruption. These apply across all our businesses and can be found on our website. All employees are trained in anti-bribery and anti-corruption to help mitigate the risk of reputational damage, financial penalties and possible exclusion from certain approved partnerships.

# Political donations

In line with our policy, we have not made any donations to political parties during the year.

At our next AGM, our directors will again be asking for the authority to make political donations of no more than £25,000 in total. This is to strengthen our corporate governance by making sure that neither Airtel Africa nor our subsidiaries inadvertently breach the wide definitions in Part 14 of the Companies Act.

# Employing people with disabilities

It is our policy that people with disabilities should be fairly considered for any job vacancy.

We are committed, wherever possible, to making sure people with disabilities are supported and encouraged to apply for employment and able to work successfully at Airtel Africa.

# Important events since the end of the financial year

Details of important events affecting the Group which have occurred since the end of the financial year are set out in the strategic report and on page 235, note 36 to the consolidated financial statements.

# Our auditor

Deloitte LLP have confirmed their willingness to continue as our auditor. Following our Audit and Risk Committee's review of their effectiveness (described on page 126), we'll propose at our AGM that we reappoint Deloitte.

Our policy is that our auditor will not carry out non-audit services, except where appropriate and in line with our policy for doing such work. Our Audit and Risk Committee also considers the ethical and auditing professional standards related to non-audit services by our external auditor. Deloitte provided limited non-audit services during the year in line with our policy as described in the Audit and Risk Committee report – see page 127.

As at the date of this report, so far as each director is aware, there's no relevant audit information of which our auditor is unaware. Each director confirms that they've taken all appropriate steps to make themselves aware of relevant audit information and to make sure our auditor is aware of that information. This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of section 418 of the Companies Act 2006.

# Audit and Risk Committee recommendations and statements of compliance

The committee has completed its review of the effectiveness of internal controls, including risk management, during the year and up to the date of this Annual Report. The review covered all material controls including financial, operating and compliance. As such, we can provide assurance to the Board under the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code. This is covered in more detail in the Audit and Risk Committee report – see pages 117-127.

Airtel Africa has complied throughout the reporting period with the provisions of the Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) order 2014.

# Annual general meeting (AGM)

Our AGM will be live streamed on Tuesday 4 July 2023 at 11am BST from 53/54 Grosvenor Street, London W1K 3HU. Details of the business to be transacted at the AGM are included in our 2023 notice of the AGM available on our website at www.airtel.africa.

In line with recent practice and good governance, we'll conduct all voting on resolutions at this year's AGM by poll. The Board believes that this way of voting gives as many shareholders as possible the opportunity to have their votes counted.

This directors' report has been approved by the Board and is signed on its behalf by:

# Directors' responsibilities statement

# The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law, the directors are required to prepare our financial statements in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards in line with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. We have elected to prepare the company's financial statements in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (GAAP), including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework. Under company law, the directors must not approve the accounts unless satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of our company and of our profit or loss for that period.

In preparing our company's financial statements, the directors are required to:

- Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently  
- Make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent  
- State whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements  
- Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that Airtel Africa will continue in business

In preparing the Group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors:

- Properly select and apply accounting policies  
- Present information, including accounting policies, in a way that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information  
- Provide additional disclosures when the specific requirements in IFRSs do not enable readers to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on our financial position and financial performance  
- Make an assessment of our ability to continue as a going concern

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that show and explain the company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time our financial position. These records must also enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and for taking reasonable steps to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.

The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on our website. UK legislation governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

# Responsibility statement

# We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:

- The financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole.  
- The strategic report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.  
- The Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess the company's position and performance, business model and strategy.

This responsibility statement was approved by the Board of directors on 10 May 2023 and is signed on its behalf by:

# Doug Baillie

Chair, Remuneration Committee

This report sets out the remuneration policy for our directors, what they've been paid in the year and how this is linked to the performance achieved.

# There are three sections to the report:

# Part 1

An introduction from the committee chair – this explains our approach to remuneration, summarises the key decisions made by the committee during the year (also part of the annual remuneration report), and gives an overview of our 2022/23 approach and policy.

# Part 2

The directors' remuneration policy – this sets out the proposed remuneration policy for our CEO, CFO, chair and non-executive directors, which will be submitted for shareholder approval at the 2023 AGM and will remain in force until the 2026 AGM at the latest.

# Part 3

Our annual report on remuneration – this sets out in detail how we applied our current remuneration policy in 2022/23, the remuneration received by directors for the year and how the policy will be applied in 2023/24. This report will be put to an advisory shareholder vote at the AGM.

All amounts in this report are in US dollars (\$), unless stated otherwise.

# Chair's introduction

I'm pleased to present the Remuneration Committee's report for 2022/23.

# Performance outcomes for the year

To recap on the performance as described in the strategic report, this year Airtel Africa delivered a strong performance, with double-digit revenue, underlying EBITDA and operating free cash flow growth. Airtel Africa has delivered on growth opportunities despite macroeconomic volatilities, with the customer base growing to 140m customers.

Annual bonuses for 2022/23 were based on a scorecard of measures: net revenue (35%), EBITDA (35%), operating free cash flow (10%) and ESG and Governance objectives (20%). Given the Group's strong performance with  $18.3\%$  growth in net revenue on a constant currency basis,  $17.3\%$  growth in underlying EBITDA and  $18.6\%$  growth in operating free cash flow, the targets for all of the financial objectives were exceeded. Both of our executive directors in the year also had role-specific personal objectives for the year - see page 156 for details. As a result, bonuses of  $74.45\%$  of maximum were awarded to our CEO and our CFO. One-third of the bonuses will be deferred into shares for two years.

Our CFO was granted an award in 2020 which vested subject to performance up to 31 March 2023. This award vested at  $100\%$ . See page 157 for details.

# Considering formulaic outcomes

Our committee reviewed the formulaic outcomes against the bonus and LTIP targets and decided that these were a fair reflection of the overall performance achieved for shareholders. We confirm that in assessing performance against the targets, no discretion was applied to the outcome and that the policy operated as intended.

# Review of the policy in 2022/23

Last year, we made minor amendments to the policy before its expiry in order to incorporate best practice features. However, we did not conduct a full review of the policy at that time.

The current policy provides for base salary, benefits, pension, annual bonus and long-term incentive awards (LTIP) and allows long-term incentive awards to be delivered in a mix of performance shares (PSP) and restricted shares (RSU) with a performance underpin. It includes best practice features such as bonus deferral, post-vesting holding periods, in-employment and post-employment shareholder requirements, and malus and clawback.

This policy received strong support from our shareholders, having received  $94.98\%$  of votes in support of its adoption at the 2023 AGM. Now, in line with our normal review schedule, we have reviewed the policy to ensure it continues to support our strategic goals for the next three years.

Since the IPO, our remuneration policies have provided headroom to allow incentive levels to increase in line with the achievement of our ambitious growth plans. In accordance with this approach, the policy maximum has been set above the intended grant level. Since the IPO actual incentive opportunities have been below the maximum levels and have not increased in the last three years even though Airtel Africa has grown and even exceeded its growth targets.

# Directors' remuneration report continued

Airtel's strong growth since IPO has now resulted in the policy maximum LTIP level falling behind market median for a company of Airtel's size. Moreover, the current policy maximum will be a constraining factor in delivering remuneration at market levels as Airtel continues to grow.

As a result, we are proposing a new policy which seeks to achieve the following goals:

(a) Bring total target remuneration to market levels, which is supported by Airtel's strong performance.  
(b) Continue to provide headroom so that incentive opportunities can be increased if Airtel continues to achieve its ambitious growth targets over the next three years.  
(c) Introduce differentiation in incentive levels between the CEO and other executive directors.  
(d) Continues to weight variable remuneration towards the long-term components.  
(e) Continues to support our entrepreneurial culture.

In addition, the next three years will include some major strategic goals fundamental to our growth strategy, such as the IPO of Airtel Money. As a result, the new policy will also include a facility to motivate and reward the achievement of these goals, as these will not necessarily lend themselves to being covered by our existing annual bonus or LTIP.

# Proposed changes to the Directors' Remuneration Policy and amendment to the rules of the long-term incentive plan

As a result of the review of the remuneration policy, the Committee is proposing the following changes to the current remuneration policy:

(a) Differentiate annual bonus opportunities for the CEO and other executive directors by reducing the annual bonus policy maximum for other executive directors.  
(b) Increase and differentiate the policy maximum LTIP award levels for the CEO and other executive directors.  
(c) Place a cap on annual RSU award levels within the overall maximum LTIP award levels.  
(d) Introduce a facility for a one-off exceptional award opportunity to incentivise a strategic initiative (such as a successful IPO of Airtel Money).

This policy would be implemented in a similar manner to our previous policies. Incentive levels will initially be set below the policy maximum levels, and will result in total target remuneration for each executive director which is around the market median level for companies of similar market cap to Airtel Africa, and whilst taking into account remuneration levels at like-minded direct comparators in Africa, which include Vodacom, MTN Safaricom and Orange Africa. This approach of providing headroom in the policy provides the necessary flexibility for a company with high growth ambitions.

In order to enable the company to make one-off exceptional awards under the new policy, shareholders will be asked to approve certain amendments to the rules of our existing long-term incentive plan at our 2023 AGM.

# Applying the new policy in 2023/24

Salaries for the CEO and the CFO will be increased by  $5\%$ , which is below the planned increase for employees which is slightly above  $8\%$ .

Maximum bonus opportunity is capped at  $200\%$  of base salary for the CEO, and  $175\%$  of base salary for the CFO, under the new policy, if approved by shareholders at the 2023 AGM. The actual 2023/24 bonus opportunities for the executive directors will be set below these policy maximum levels. The 2022/23 target bonus will be set at  $75\%$  of base salary for the CEO and  $70\%$  of salary for the CFO. In line with the policy, one-third of any bonus will be deferred into shares for two years. It is intended that metrics and weightings remain unchanged from last year, with  $80\%$  based on financial metrics (net revenue, underlying EBITDA and operating free cash flow) and  $20\%$  non-financial.

LTIP grants will also be made at levels below the maximum levels permitted under the new policy, if approved by shareholders at the 2023 AGM. LTIP grants will consist of performance shares (with a maximum face value of  $150\%$  of salary for the CEO and  $100\%$  of salary for the CFO), and restricted stock units (with a face value of  $50\%$  of salary for the CEO and  $40\%$  of salary for the CFO). These increases will bring the CEO and CFO target remuneration to around market median levels, and deliver the majority of the increase in performance-linked long-term remuneration. We believe that a significant proportion of pay should be tied to performance. We will continue to set robust and challenging performance targets for both the bonus and the performance shares component of the LTIP, with vesting of restricted stock units dependent on the satisfaction of a financial underpin.

As in 2022/23, three performance conditions will apply to the performance shares: relative TSR (20%), underlying EBITDA (40%) and net revenue (40%), with each measured over three years. The underlying EBITDA and net revenue targets will not be disclosed at grant as they are currently considered to be commercially sensitive. They will be disclosed when this changes – no later than the report for the year in which the awards vest. The underpin applying to the grant of restricted stock units will require a positive operating free cash flow over the three financial years ending the year before the units vest.

During the next three years, a successful IPO of Airtel Money is a strategic priority and will create significant value for Airtel Africa shareholders. Given the importance of this goal, and the role which the executive directors play in its achievement, the committee intends to grant a one-off incentive award linked to a successful listing. This incentive will sit alongside the annual bonus and PSP awards, which are designed to incentivise the successful management of the remaining businesses, and its key terms are as follows:

(a) Award of equity in Airtel Money shares  
(b) Award will vest on IPO subject to this not being later than three years from grant and subject to the meeting of performance targets linked to the IPO price, (which will be disclosed retrospectively) and continued employment. If the IPO does not occur within three years from grant, the award will lapse  
(c) Award is subject to clawback and malus  
(d) Award is subject to a one year post-vesting holding period

No vesting will occur if a threshold IPO price which creates significant value for shareholders is not achieved. The award will align the remuneration of executive directors with Airtel Africa's current strategic priorities and the interests of shareholders.

# Conclusion

The past year has once again demonstrated the strong resilience of all of Airtel Africa's employees. The company has maintained its position as one of the fastest growing and most profitable mobile communications company in Africa and made very good progress in embedding its sustainability plan in all it does. Importantly it has continued to live out its purpose of delivering vital services and helping to transform the lives of all its stakeholders.

The implementation of the policy, as set out above, will motivate and reward the achievement of our strategic goals by increasing the portion of variable remuneration linked to three-year performance measures, by including a new incentive linked to the successful IPO of Airtel Money, and by bringing remuneration closer to market median levels. This planned implementation will result in total target remuneration for the CEO and CFO around or below market median levels, when compared to companies of similar size.

I would like to thank my fellow committee members for their continued diligence and dedication. We look forward to seeing your support for the new policy and remuneration report at this year's AGM and, more importantly, seeing the continued benefits of our work to all our stakeholders over the coming years.

I will be attending the 2023 AGM and look forward to engaging with shareholders at the meeting. In the meantime, if you'd like to discuss any aspects of this report please contact me through our company secretary, Simon O'Hara (see page 251 for contact details).

# Main activities in 2022/23

During the financial year, the committee:

Agreed annual salary increases and reviewed senior executive remuneration  
- Implemented and made awards under our share plans  
- Determined the level of bonus payments for the previous financial year  
- Determined the level of LTIP vesting for the CFO

# Shareholder consultation

Shareholders were consulted during the year on the proposed policy and its implementation. Letters were sent to major shareholders and voting advisory bodies in order to explain the rationale for the policy changes and understand the views of our shareholders. Only a minority of shareholders who were contacted decided to participate in the consultation, and the chair of the Remuneration Committee responded to their questions through correspondence and meetings. Shareholders' main questions related to the rationale for the special incentive arrangement, why the policy maximum levels were being positioned above market median, and how the comparator group for benchmarking purposes had been selected. The responses to shareholders were in line with the information provided earlier in this annual statement on each of these topics.

# Engaging with employees

The report on pages 132 and 137 explains our work on diversity and the various ways in which management engaged with employees during the year. While our committee doesn't directly consult employees on executive remuneration, a non-executive director attended our regular town halls at which a wide range of topics were discussed with our CEO, including employee remuneration.

# Effectiveness

The external Board evaluation reviewed our committee's effectiveness and sought feedback from the committee members. We discussed the output of the evaluation, which concluded that we continued to operate effectively throughout the year. We also confirmed our intended areas of focus for the year ahead.

# Directors' remuneration report continued

# Part 2

# Directors' remuneration policy

This sets out the policy which will be submitted for shareholder approval at the 2023 AGM.

We developed the policy taking into account the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the views of our major shareholders, and pay and conditions of other employees which were considered when the Committee discussed the new policy. The policy is intended to attract, motivate and retain high-calibre directors, to promote the long-term success of Airtel Africa, and to be in line with good practice and the interests of our shareholders. To avoid conflicts of interest, executive directors were not included in discussions on the new policy, and the policy was approved by the Remuneration Committee. The policy will be implemented by the Remuneration Committee.

The policy differs from the previous shareholder approved policy in the following key areas:

- Differentiation in the maximum annual bonus opportunities allowed under the policy.  
- Increase in the LTIP opportunity allowable under the policy to provide headroom over the next three years for larger award sizes if Airtel Africa continues to deliver high levels of growth. These opportunities will not be used in full in FY2023/24.  
- Cap on RSU opportunity of  $50\%$  of base salary.  
- Introduction of a facility for one-off awards linked to key strategic initiatives

There are other minor wording changes to make sure the policy is clear and easily understood.

# Key principles of our remuneration policy

Our committee took into account the UK Corporate Governance Code's six factors in Provision 40 in determining the remuneration policy. We believe the policy addresses these factors:

- Clarity: the structure of remuneration is designed to support our company strategy, aligning the interests of our executive directors with those of our shareholders.  
- Simplicity: we operate a simple remuneration framework, comprising fixed pay, short- and long-term incentives. The use of both performance and restricted shares may add a little complexity, but this is appropriate and critical to our talent agenda for the markets in which we operate.  
- Proportionality: remuneration is set at competitive levels to ensure our ability to attract and retain premium talent. There is a direct link between the success of the strategy and the value received by executive directors.  
- Alignment to culture: the remuneration approach supports our strategy objectives and reflects the diversity of our business. The structure of the package, and benefits in particular, reflects local practices and employment conditions in the countries in which executive directors are based and/or recruited from.  
- Predictability: a significant proportion of executive directors' remuneration should be performance based. The policy sets out the possible future value of remuneration executive directors can receive.  
- Risk: the package is appropriately balanced between the achievement of short-term and longer-term objectives and does not reward poor performance or encourage inappropriate risk-taking.

Executive directors' remuneration policy table  

<table><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>Purpose and link to strategy</td><td>How we assess performance</td><td>Maximum opportunity</td></tr><tr><td>Base salary</td><td>To recruit and reward executive directors of a suitable calibre for the role and duties required</td><td>Normally reviewed annually by committee, taking account of company and individual performance, changes in responsibility and levels of increase for the broader employee population. 
Reference is also made to market levels in companies of similar size and complexity. 
We consider the impact of any base salary increase on the total remuneration package. 
Salaries (and other elements of the remuneration package) may be paid in different currencies as appropriate to reflect the geographic location.</td><td>There is no prescribed maximum salary or annual increase. 
However, increases will generally be guided by increases for the broader employee population. 
Increases above this level may be made in specific situations to recognise development in the role, changes in responsibility, material changes to the business or exceptional company performance.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Benefits and pension</td><td>To provide market competitive benefits</td><td>Benefits for executive directors will typically reflect their country of residence. 
Where an executive director receives an expatriate package, additional cash benefits may be provided. Expatriate benefits may include housing allowance, education allowance and home leave tickets. Car allowances, life and medical insurance may also be provided. Statutory benefits as required under local law of the host country will also be paid. 
Pensions may be provided where this is in line with the workforce provision and statutory requirements in the executive’s home location. 
We may also equalise for double taxation between the required work location and the executive’s country of residence, if required.</td><td>Maximum values are determined by reference to market practice, avoiding paying more than is necessary. Where pension is offered, this will be in line with statutory requirements in the executive’s home location and in line with the wider workforce for that location.</td><td></td></tr></table>

<table><tr><td></td><td>Purpose and link to strategy</td><td>How we assess performance</td><td>Maximum opportunity</td></tr><tr><td>Bonus plan</td><td>To incentivise and reward annual performance achievements. To also provide sustained alignment with shareholders through a component deferred in shares</td><td>Awards are based on annual performance against a scorecard of metrics aligned with our strategy, KPIs and other yearly goals. Financial measures have the highest weighting. Performance against strategic financial and non-financial objectives may also be used, but will not normally account for more than 20% of the total. The policy gives the committee the authority to select suitable performance metrics aligned to our strategy and shareholders&#x27; interests, and to assess the performance outcome. One-third of any bonus is normally delivered in shares deferred for a further two years. Any dividend equivalents accruing on shares between the date when the awards were granted and when the awards vest will normally be delivered in shares. Malus and clawback provisions apply to both the cash and share-based element of awards for a period of two years from the date of payment (cash) or date of release (shares) if there is: 
• Misstatement of the company&#x27;s accounts 
• An error in calculating performance 
• Gross misconduct resulting in dismissal 
• Material failure in risk management 
• Reputational damage 
• Material downturn in financial performance 
• Any other event or events that the committee considers to be both exceptional and sufficiently adverse to the interests of the company</td><td>The maximum annual bonus is 200% of base salary for the CEO, and 175% for other executive directors. The committee will use its discretion within these limits to consider the maximum bonus opportunity each year, taking account of market development opportunities, specific events and role expansion. Threshold performance results in a payment of 30% of maximum. Dividend or dividend equivalents may be earned on the deferred bonus component. Change from previous policy: Reduction in policy maximum from 200% to 175% of base salary for other executive directors.</td></tr><tr><td>Long-term incentive plan (LTIP)</td><td>To incentivise and reward the delivery of the company&#x27;s strategic objectives and provide further alignment with shareholders through the use of shares</td><td>Awards may comprise performance shares (PSP) and/or restricted stock units (RSUs). Individuals are considered each year for an award of shares that normally vest after three years to the extent that any performance conditions are met and in line with the terms of the shareholder-approved plan. PSP awards are made subject to continued employment and the satisfaction of stretching performance conditions normally measured over three years set by the committee before each grant. The committee will have discretion to change the metrics and weighting from year to year. Major shareholders will normally be consulted before any significant changes. Awards of RSUs depend on continued employment and a financial underpin set by the committee before each grant. Awards granted in 2022 will require positive operating free cash flow over three financial years. The LTIP vesting outcome can be reduced, if necessary, to reflect the underlying or general performance of Airtel Africa. A two-year post-vesting holding period also normally applies to LTIP awards that vest (net of tax) after the adoption of this policy. Any dividend equivalents will normally be delivered at the end of the vesting period in shares based on the proportion of the award that vests. Malus and clawback provisions apply to awards made for three years from the date on which the award vest when there has been: 
• A misstatement of the company&#x27;s accounts 
• An error in calculating performance 
• Gross misconduct resulting in dismissal 
• Material failure in risk management 
• Reputational damage 
• Material downturn in financial performance 
• Any other event or events that the committee considers to be both exceptional and sufficiently adverse to the interests of the company</td><td>The maximum annual grant limit is 300% of base salary (face value of shares at grant) for the CEO and 250% of base salary for other executive directors. No more than 50% of base salary may be granted as RSUs to any one person in a single year. A maximum of 25% of the PSP award is available for threshold performance, rising to 100% of the grant for performance at the stretch level. In accordance with the LTIP plan rules, dividend or dividend equivalents may be earned on vested shares. Change from previous policy: Increase in LTIP award level from 200% of base salary to 300% of base salary for the CEO and to 250% of base salary for other executive directors.

# Discretion in operating the incentive plans

To make sure these plans are operated and administered efficiently, the committee has discretion in relation to a number of areas. Consistent with the marketplace, these include (but are not limited to):

- Selecting the participants  
- The timing of grant and/or payment  
- The size of grants and/or payments (within the limits set out in the policy table)  
- The extent and timing of vesting based on the assessment of performance  
- Determining a 'good leaver' and, where relevant, the extent of vesting for share-based plans  
- Treatment in exceptional circumstances such as change of control, when the committee would act in the best interests of our business and its shareholders  
- Making the adjustments required in certain circumstances (such as rights issues, corporate restructuring, variation of capital and special dividends)  
- The form of settlement of awards in accordance with the discretions set out in the plan rules  
- The annual review of performance measures, weightings and targets for the discretionary incentive plans from year to year  
- The interpretation and operation of requirements related to the holding of shares in Airtel Africa

The committee has the right to amend or substitute any performance conditions if something occurs that would stop the condition from achieving its original purpose. Any amended condition would not be materially easier to satisfy in the circumstances.

# Choice of performance measures and approach to target setting

Targets for each year's annual incentive and long-term incentive award are determined by the committee, and, if relevant, any one-off award for exceptional strategic initiatives, taking a range of factors into account. Financial goals include the annual budget, the relevant three-year strategic plan, analysts' consensus factors, wider economic facts and affordability for the business. Non-financial goals reflect the priorities of our business and responsibilities of the role.

The annual bonus is based on performance against a stretching combination of financial and non-financial performance measures aligned with our KPIs and operational goals for the year. As such, they typically include measures of revenue, profitability and cash flow, which reflect our focus on profitable growth, cash generation and satisfying our debt and other capital commitments. For 2023 these will comprise net revenue (35%), underlying EBITDA (35%), operating free cash flow (10%), and non-financial objectives (20%) as key indicators of our growth, profitability and financial health. Executive directors and members of our senior management team are also assessed on personal objectives, as agreed by our committee at the start of each year. The committee reviews and adapts the objectives each year as appropriate to reflect the priorities for the business in the year ahead.

The committee sets a sliding scale of targets for each financial measure to encourage continuous improvement and to stretch performance. The policy gives the committee the authority to select suitable performance metrics aligned to our strategy and shareholder interest.

The performance conditions for the PSP in 2023/24 are based on relative TSR against the MSCI Emerging Markets Communication Services Index (20%), net revenue (40%) and underlying EBITDA (40%). The underpin for grants of RSUs are based on operating free cash flow. These measures are key indicators of our growth, financial health and are aligned with our shareholders' interests. The committee sets a sliding scale of challenging performance targets for each measure for the PSP – for more on these targets, see page 157. The committee reviews the choice of performance measures and the appropriateness of the performance targets and TSR peer group before each PSP grant. While different performance measures and/or weightings may be applied for future awards, the committee will consult with major shareholders before making any significant changes.

The performance conditions for any one-off awards for strategic initiatives would be linked to the successful delivery of the strategic initiative and the creation of value for Airtel Africa shareholders. The performance targets would be tailored to the specific strategic objective, but would be set so that: (a) the maximum award would be only payable for achieving a stretching level of performance, and (b) the delivery of a 'target' level of performance would result in around  $50\%$  of the maximum award becoming payable.

# Legacy arrangements

Airtel Africa has the authority to honour any commitments entered into with current or former directors before this policy is approved or before their appointment to the Board. Details of any such payments will be set out in the remuneration report for the relevant year.

# Executive directors' existing service contracts

Our executive directors can enter into agreements with a fixed or indefinite term that may be terminated by either party on three months' written notice. At the committee's discretion, we may make a payment in lieu of notice – this is calculated relative to base salary and benefits only, paid on a phased basis and subject to mitigation.

Entitlement to both annual bonus and LTIP awards will typically lapse on cessation. In good leaver circumstances pro-rata bonuses may be paid and LTIP awards may vest in line with our policy and the plan rules. If a director commits an act of gross misconduct or similar, they may be dismissed without notice and without further payment or compensation, except for sums accrued up to the leaving date.

<table><tr><td>Name of director</td><td>Date of service contract</td><td>Unexpired term</td></tr><tr><td>Segun Ogunsanya</td><td>1 October 2021</td><td>10 years</td></tr><tr><td>Jaideep Paul</td><td>1 June 2021</td><td>10 years</td></tr></table>

# Approach to remuneration for new executive directors

The remuneration package for a newly appointed executive director will be set in line with the remuneration policy in force at the time. Variable remuneration will be determined in the same way as for existing executive directors, and is subject to the maximum limits on variable pay referred to in the policy table on page 150.

The committee may also buy out any remuneration and contract features that an executive director may be giving up in order to become an executive director of Airtel Africa. Such buyouts would take into account the nature of awards forfeited and would reflect (as far as possible) performance conditions, the value foregone and the time over which they would have vested or been paid. Where shares are used, these awards may be made under the terms of the LTIP or under a separate arrangement as permitted under UK Listing Rules.

The committee may agree that certain relocation, legal, tax equalisation and other incidental expenses will be met as appropriate.

For an internal appointment, any legacy arrangements related to the previous role will be allowed to pay out as per their original terms unless they are bought out by the company, even if these are in conflict with the policy in place at the time.

# Service contracts for new executive directors and policy on loss of office

Contracts for new executive directors will normally include up to six months' notice by either party. This table summarises how the main elements of pay will normally be treated.

<table><tr><td></td><td>Good leaver</td><td>Other leavers</td><td>Dismissal for cause</td></tr><tr><td>Base salary</td><td>Payable for unexpired portion of notice period or settled by making a cash payment in lieu</td><td></td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>Benefits and pension</td><td>Continues to be provided for unexpired portion of notice period or settled in cash</td><td></td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>Annual bonus</td><td>Paid for period worked and subject to the normal performance conditions Paid following the relevant year end in cash</td><td>Normally lapse</td><td>Lapse</td></tr><tr><td>Deferred bonus awards</td><td>Typically vest on normal timetable without pro-rating for time</td><td>Normally lapse</td><td>Lapse</td></tr><tr><td>Share-based awards</td><td>Typically vest according to normal schedule subject to performance conditions (if applicable) and usually pro-rated for time</td><td>Normally lapse</td><td>Lapse</td></tr></table>

The committee would try to mitigate any payments in lieu of notice by, for example, making payments in instalments that can be reduced or ended if the former director wants to begin alternative employment during the payment period. We will pay as necessary any statutory entitlements or sums to settle or compromise claims in connection with a termination (including, at the discretion of the committee, reimbursement for legal advice and provision of outplacement services).

On a change of control of Airtel Africa, outstanding awards will normally vest early to the extent that the performance conditions have been satisfied. Awards would normally be reduced pro-rata to reflect the time between the grant date and the date of the corporate event.

If there is a demerger, special dividend or other event the committee thinks may affect the current or future value of shares, they may decide that awards will vest on the same basis as on a change of control. If there is an internal corporate reorganisation, awards will be replaced by equivalent new awards over shares in a new holding company, unless the committee decides that awards should vest on the same basis on a change of control.

We may reimburse the reasonable expenses of directors that relate to their duties for Airtel Africa (including tax if applicable). We may also provide advice and assistance with directors' tax returns where these are affected by their duties on our behalf.

All non-executive directors have letters of appointment for an initial period of three years. In keeping with best practice, non-executive directors are subject to re-election each year at our AGM. The chair's appointment may be terminated be either party with six months' notice, and the appointments of the other non-executive directors may be terminated by either party with one month's notice. Either appointment can also be terminated at any time if the director is removed by resolution at an AGM or pursuant to the Articles.

Directors' letters of appointment are available for inspection during normal business hours at our registered office and also at our yearly AGM. All directors were appointed for a fixed term ending on the date of our 2022 AGM and were renewed for a further three years, with the exception of Kelly Bayer Rosmarin and Tsega Gebreyes who have letter of appointment end dates of 27 October 2023 and 12 October 2024 respectively reflecting their date of appointment to the Board.

# Shareholder context

The committee considers the views of shareholders when reviewing the remuneration of executive directors and other senior executives.

We consult directly with major shareholders about any material changes to the policy and work with shareholders to understand any concerns. For example, the committee consulted with major shareholders on changes to this policy during the development of this proposed policy.

# Broader employee context

The committee considers executive remuneration in the context of our wider employee population. Remuneration for executive directors is more weighted towards variable pay than for other employees so that more of their pay is conditional on the successful delivery of business strategy. Our aim is to create a clear link between the value created for shareholders and the remuneration of our executive directors.

Airtel engages with employees on a number of issues, including remuneration, in a variety of ways. For example, the designated non-executive director for employee engagement holds regular meetings with employees when he visits sites throughout the year, and Board members when they visit markets during any year hold engagement sessions with the workforce. Through these meetings and engagement, our Board members inform employees on executive remuneration and receive feedback. This engagement approach is kept under review as we continually seek to improve the Board's dialogue with employees.

# Notes

2 From the date of joining the Board on 1 June 2021.  
3 Segun's benefits included ( $000) of: expatriate housing benefit of$ 247, car benefit value of $71, and insurance costs of $5. Jaideep Paul's benefits included ( $000) of: expatriate housing of$ 69, car of $58, expatriate home leave tickets entitlement of $25 and insurance costs of $5.  
Only Segun Ogunsanya receives a pension contribution of  $10\%$  of his salary – this is in accordance with his legacy arrangements which reflect statutory requirements for employees in his home location of Nigeria.  
For Jaideep Paul, the 2022/23 figure includes 397,590 PSU awards and 198,795 RSU awards which were granted on 30 October 2020 and will vest in 2023. The PSU awards were subject to a performance condition and the RSU awards were subject to a performance underpin, both of which had performance periods ending on 31 March 2023. The value of these awards has been estimated using the average price of Airtel Africa shares between 1 January 2022 and 31 March 2022. For 2022/23, the total value estimated attributable to share price appreciation is $550,900.  
The 2021/22 LTIP value for Jaideep Paul has been restated based on the share price of $1.941 on the vesting date of 01 June 2022. For the 2021/22 LTIP the total value estimated attributable to share price appreciation is $124,401. Last year's report contained an estimate of the level of vesting for the TSR element of these awards. It was estimated that 100% of the shares subject to the TSR performance condition would vest, and this estimate has since been confirmed, as Airtel Africa's TSR of 26% per annum over the performance period placed it first amongst the three comparators and exceeded the 10% per annum requirement for full vesting. The value in last year's report was estimated using an average share price.

# Annual bonus

Airtel Africa delivered strong performance, exceeding the targets in all key financial metrics. Revenue growth in constant currency continued to grow double digit, as did underlying EBITDA and operating free cash flow. In more detail, revenue grew by  $18.3\%$ , underlying EBITDA grew by  $17.3\%$ , and operational free cash flow grew by  $18.6\%$ .

Performance was equally strong across all the key operational KPI's. Total customer base increased to 140 million (up  $9\%$ ), as the penetration of mobile data and mobile money services continued to rise, driving up the data and the mobile money customer base. The mobile money business performed strongly with annualised transaction value reaching nearly $102bn, as Airtel Africa continues to drive financial inclusion in the continent. It is in this context that we have assessed the performance achieved against the incentive targets. The strong in-year performance resulted in performance for all financial measures falling in between the target and stretch levels set at the beginning of the year. As a result, a bonus between target and the maximum level has been awarded, of which one-third will be deferred into shares for two years.

RSUs may not vest unless aggregate operating free cash flow is positive over the three financial years ending the year before the RSUs vest.  
The performance conditions for the PSUs are based on three performance measures – net revenue growth (40%), underlying EBITDA margin (40%) and relative TSR (20%). Performance is measured over a three-year period, and this combination of measures helps to align the operation of the LTIP with shareholders' interests and our business strategy. Net revenue growth provides a key indicator of long-term growth achieved in the market. Underlying EBITDA margin is a key indicator of long-term growth in profitability from our operations. Relative TSR measures the total returns to our shareholders providing close alignment with shareholder interests.

Airtel Africa operates only in Africa. We have three main competitors, none of whom disclose targets in their Annual Remuneration Reports. For competitive and commercial reasons, the Board does not believe it would be in the interests of our shareholders to disclose our net revenue and underlying EBITDA LTIP targets. The targets will be disclosed when they're no longer considered commercially sensitive. This will be no later than the year in which the awards vest. Our targets are based on the 2022/23 three-year plan and will require competitive market-leading growth in net revenue at target with more than  $5\%$  up and down to threshold and maximum. The underlying EBIT from an already high competitive base will be equally stretching, and both targets will be fully disclosed on vesting. On TSR against the MSCI Emerging Markets Communications Service Index, threshold will vest at the 50th percentile with the maximum at the 75th percentile.

# Share awards vesting in relation to 2022/23

The CFO was granted a RSU award over 198,795 shares subject to an Operating free cash flow performance underpin, and a PSP award over 397,590 shares on 30 October 2020 subject to performance measured to the end of 31 March 2023 against the following conditions:

The underpin for the RSU awards required aggregate Operating free cash flow to be positive over the three-year performance period ending on 31 March 2022. Over the three financial years, aggregate Operating free cash flow was $4,770m, which resulted in the underpin being satisfied.

# CEO pay ratio

As the majority of our employees are based in Africa, with only seven in the UK, we're not required to publish a CEO pay ratio. Given the numbers of employees in the UK versus those overseas and the fact that the people in the UK are mainly involved in operating our head office, the ratio produced by comparing CEO remuneration with that of our UK employees is likely to be misleading. As such, we've decided not to publish this information. However, the committee takes into account pay relativities, employee wellbeing when setting executive remuneration, and we aim to be an employer of choice with a diverse and inclusive work environment that continues to foster a culture of high performance, wellbeing, skills enhancement and coaching.

# Statement of directors' shareholdings and share interests (audited)

The beneficial and non-beneficial share interests of our directors and their connected persons in line with regulations, as at 31 March 2022 and 31 March 2023 (or on appointment or departure to the Board if different), are listed below.

# Executive directors (audited)

Executive directors must build up and maintain a shareholding in Airtel Africa equivalent to  $250\%$  of their base salary within five years of being appointed to the Board. Under the proposed policy, the CFO will be required to build and maintain a shareholding of  $200\%$  of their salary over the same time period. While the executive director is building to this shareholding level, deferred bonus awards (net of expected taxes) that will apply on vesting will count towards this requirement. LTIP shares that have vested and that are within the two-year post-vesting holding period will also count on a net of tax basis.

To deal with unexpected circumstances, the committee has the discretion to make exceptions and allowances if it sees fit.

# Independent auditor's report to the members of Airtel Africa plc

# Report on the audit of the financial statements

# 1. Opinion

In our opinion:

- the financial statements of Airtel Africa plc (the 'company') and its subsidiaries (the 'Group') give a true and fair view of the state of the Group's and of the company's affairs as at 31 March 2023 and of the Group's profit for the year then ended;  
- the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom adopted international accounting standards and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB);  
- the company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, including Financial Reporting Standard 101 "Reduced Disclosure Framework"; and  
- the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements which comprise:

- the consolidated statement of comprehensive income;  
- the consolidated and company statements of financial position;  
- the consolidated and company statements of changes in equity;  
- the consolidated cash flow statement; and  
- the related notes 1 to 35 of the Group financial statements and the related notes 1 to 11 of the company financial statements.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law, United Kingdom adopted international accounting standards and IFRSs as issued by the IASB. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS101 'Reduced Disclosure Framework' (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

# 2. Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.

We are independent of the Group and the company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the Financial Reporting Council's (the 'FRC's') Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. The non-audit services provided to the Group and company for the year are disclosed in note 8.1 in the Group financial statements. We confirm that we have not provided any non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard to the Group or the company.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

# 3. Summary of our audit approach

<table><tr><td>Key audit matters</td><td>The key audit matters that we identified in the current year were: 
·Prepaid and Airtel Money (mobile money) revenue 
·Airtel Money restricted cash; and 
·The classification of legal cases. 
Within this report, key audit matters are identified as follows: 
·Newly identified 
·Increased level of risk 
·Similar level of risk 
·Decreased level of risk</td></tr><tr><td>Materiality</td><td>The materiality that we used for the Group financial statements was $65m which represents 6.3% of profit before tax (March 2022: 5.1% of profit before tax) and 2.5% (March 2022: 3%) of underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (underlying EBITDA).</td></tr><tr><td>Scoping</td><td>Our scope covered seventeen components. Of these, three were full-scope audits. Six components were subject to an audit of specified account balances and seven components were subject to analytical review procedures. A further component is the Group&#x27;s shared service centre in India. The scope of this component was either a full scope or an audit of specified account balances depending on the scope of the component managed at the shared service centre. These covered 96% of Group profit before tax, 97% of Group revenue and 96% of the Group total assets. Components and balances not in scope were subject to analytical procedures performed by the Group audit team.</td></tr><tr><td>Significant changes in our approach</td><td>Airtel Money restricted cash has now been included as a separate key audit matter given the increase in size and prominence of the Group&#x27;s mobile money business. Going concern has not been included as key audit matter this year given the continued profitability of the Group and the early prepayment of bonds in the current year. Gabon, Chad, Congo B, Rwanda, Seychelles and Madagascar are now subject to analytical review procedures this year as these components are deemed not to be significant to the Group. 
We tested the operating effectiveness of controls relating to IFRS16, the classification of legal and regulatory matters as well as the consolidation process this year.</td></tr></table>

# 4. Conclusions relating to going concern

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

Our evaluation of the directors' assessment of the Group's and company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:

- Obtaining an understanding of the relevant controls over the Group's forecasting process;  
Performing retrospective reviews of historical forecasts to assess the reasonableness of the Group's forecasting process;  
- Performing risk assessment procedures in response to the economic disruption risk. This covered a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements;  
- Assessing the reasonableness of the anticipated impact of the Group's principal risks on the Group's cash flow projections and how these were factored into the Group's reasonable worst case forecast, including: currency devaluation; a reduction in revenue and profit; and legal, tax and regulatory claims;  
- Assessing and challenging the assumptions used by the directors in each of the cash flow forecasts, considering our own expectations based on our knowledge of the Group;  
- Assessing and challenging the key mitigating actions available, including a reduction in capital expenditure and lower dividends payouts;  
- Obtaining direct confirmations of the value, duration and terms for the Group's undrawn committed facilities as at the year-end;

- Recalculating the cash headroom available using undrawn committed facilities in each of the scenarios prepared by management and approved by the directors and testing the integrity and mechanical accuracy of the going concern model; and  
- Assessing the appropriateness of the disclosures in the financial statements.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's and company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

In relation to the reporting on how the Group has applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.

# 5. Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

# 5.1.Prepaid and mobile money revenue

<table><tr><td>Key audit matter description</td><td>As set out in note 6 to the financial statements, revenue of $5,255m (March 2022: $4,714m) is derived from the provision of voice, data, mobile money and other services. These revenue streams account for $5,245m of revenue (March 2022: $4,307m) with voice and data accounting for $4,278m (March 2022: $3,883m) of revenue and mobile money services accounting for $540m (March 2022: $424m) of revenue. 
88% of voice and data revenue derives from customers who subscribe to services on a prepaid basis. Mobile money revenue relates to the commission earned on allowing customers to transfer funds and pay bills on the Group&#x27;s mobile money IT platform, Mobiquity. The Group&#x27;s accounting policies on prepaid and mobile money revenue are set out in note 2.21. 
Due to the complexity of the Group&#x27;s revenue recording systems (IN for prepaid revenue and Mobiquity for mobile money) and the volume of customer data, we identified a key audit matter relating to prepaid revenue, specifically (i) the correct set up of tariffs on the applicable systems and (ii) the manual journal posting of revenue from the billing system to the general ledger. For mobile money, we identified a key audit matter in relation to the accuracy of rates and tariffs within the Mobiquity system. Errors in either would impact the accuracy of prepaid and mobile money revenue. We also identified a fraud risk in respect of both matters.</td></tr><tr><td>How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter</td><td>Our procedures involved: 
• Working with our IT specialists to understand the IT environment in which the revenue recording systems reside, including interface controls between different IT applications. This included the IN billing system for prepaid revenue and the Mobiquity IT platform for mobile money; 
• Testing the relevant controls over (a) approvals and maintenance of new plans in the IN billing system, and (b) authorisation of rate changes and the maintenance of rates within the IN and Mobiquity systems; 
• Testing the reconciliation process between the general ledger and IN and Mobiquity, including any manual adjustments posted; 
• For prepaid revenue, testing a sample of call record validations to test the accuracy of prepaid revenue and the resolution of exceptions in addition to performing independent call testing to evidence that the amounts charged to the subscriber is consistent with the approved tariffs; 
• We analysed key movements in prepaid revenue recorded within the general ledger against cash collection in the billing systems at the Group level; 
• For prepaid revenue, tested a sample of tarrifs set up in IN system; 
• For Airtel Money, tested a sample of tariffs set up in Mobiquity system; and 
• We also created our expectation of the Airtel Money revenue by considering the transactions and the applicable rates and compared the actual revenue recorded with the expected revenue.</td></tr><tr><td>Key observations</td><td>Based on our work, we noted no significant issues on the accuracy of prepaid and mobile money revenue recorded in the year.</td></tr></table>

# Independent auditor's report to the members of Airtel Africa plc continued

# 5.2. Mobile money restricted cash

<table><tr><td>Key audit matter description</td><td>Airtel Money has been identified as a separate reportable segment for the year ended 31 March 2023 due to the growth in this business together with changes to the Group&#x27;s organisational structure, including the separate reporting of the results of mobile money to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) for the allocation of resources and assessment of performance.The Group holds cash on behalf of its mobile money customers, which is restricted for use by the Group. The total restricted cash balance as at 31 March 2023 amounted to $617m (March 2022: $513m) and is presented as ‘balance held under mobile money trust’ under cash and cash equivalents.We identified a key audit matter and a fraud risk related to the existence of this restricted cash balance.</td></tr><tr><td>How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter</td><td>Our procedures involved:

• Testing a sample of transactions at or around period end to ensure the transactions were appropriate and did not constitute transfers into the Group&#x27;s own operating bank accounts.</td></tr><tr><td>Key observations</td><td>Based on our work, we noted no exceptions regarding the existence of the mobile money restricted cash balance.</td></tr></table>

# 5.3 Classification of legal matters

<table><tr><td>Key audit matter description</td><td>Management has recorded a provision of $7m (March 2022: $7m) in respect of legal claims against components operating within complex jurisdictions. This is included in the total provision for legal and regulatory cases amounting to $34m (March 2022: $51m) as set out in note 25 to the financial statements. Contingent liabilities as at 31 March 2023 for legal claims in these jurisdictions amounted to $69m (March 2022: $70m) as described in Note 29 to the financial statements.Airtel Africa has business operations in 14 countries across Africa, each with different legal environments. Certain components operate in higher-risk and complex jurisdictions than others. Each component maintains legal registers which are updated on a monthly basis to summarise the current position of each legal case and to consider whether a legal case is assessed as probable, possible or remote in accordance with IAS 37: Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent assets, and consequently whether a provision or contingent liability disclosure is required. Management of these matters is frequently supported by external counsel in the local markets and the opinion of counsel is considered in assessing the classification of the matter as probable, possible or remote in accordance with IAS 37: Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent assets.Further information on the Group&#x27;s policies for legal matters, including the judgements taken, can be found in notes 2.19 and 2.20 of the financial statements, and within the key source of estimation uncertainty disclosures in note 3.1. The Audit and Risk Committee also comment on this area in their report on page 106.We identified a key audit matter relating to the appropriate classification and presentation of legal cases within the financial statements as remote (no disclosure), possible (contingent liability, note 29) and probable (provision, note 25) in accordance with IAS 37, with a focus on components operating in complex jurisdictions. There is an incremental challenge in predicting the outcome of the ongoing cases in these jurisdictions due to the significant number of cases and the high value of the claims. Management has exercised significant judgement in determining their assessment of the outcome and the accounting consequences thereon. As a result of these factors, we consider there to be a fraud risk associated with this key audit matter due to susceptibility of the judgement to bias.</td></tr><tr><td>How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter</td><td>Our procedures involved:Obtaining an understanding of the relevant controls concerning the classification of legal cases and testing the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of these controls;Assessing a sample of cases and challenging whether the cases are appropriately classified as probable, possible or remote based on IAS 37: Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets;Holding discussions with internal legal counsel and obtaining supporting evidence for a sample of cases;Circularising external legal counsel for a sample of cases and checking their assessment of whether a case is probable, possible or remote is appropriate. We also evaluated the competence, capability and objectivity of external legal counsel;Assessing the consistency and completeness of approach across each operating company by considering if there is any precedent for similar cases to be settled within each jurisdiction, as well as current legal settlements; andEvaluating the financial statement disclosures, including the articulation of each material case.</td></tr><tr><td>Key observations</td><td>Based on the procedures performed we consider the classification of legal cases as probable, possible and remote to be appropriate.We consider the provision and contingent liability disclosures within notes 25 and 29 of the financial statements to be appropriate.</td></tr></table>

# 6. Our application of materiality

# 6.1 Materiality

We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Group financial statements</td><td>Parent company financial statements</td></tr><tr><td>Materiality</td><td>$65m (March 2022: $62m)</td><td>$41m (March 2022: $33.5m)</td></tr><tr><td>Basis for determining materiality</td><td>6.3% of profit before tax (March 2022: 5.1% of profit before tax) and 2.5% of underlying EBITDA (March 2022: 3% of underlying EBITDA).</td><td>1% of net assets (March 2022: 1% of net assets).</td></tr><tr><td>Rationale for the benchmark applied</td><td>Profit before tax is our primary benchmark as it impacts distributable reserves and dividends, which is key for investors. Underlying EBITDA is also a key performance measure for the Group.</td><td>Airtel Africa plc is a holding company, which holds investments in a number of subsidiaries. Thus, the primary users of the company&#x27;s financial statements are the Group&#x27;s shareholders and the directors and management of its holding company (Bharti Airtel Limited) and ultimate holding company (Bharti Enterprises (Holding) Private Limited which is held by the private trusts of the Bharti family). We therefore considered net assets to be the most appropriate benchmark given the primary purpose of the company is a holding company.</td></tr></table>

\$1,034m

# 6.2 Performance materiality

We set performance materiality at a level lower than materiality to reduce the probability that, in aggregate, uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceed the materiality for the financial statements as a whole.

<table><tr><td></td><td>Group financial statements</td><td>Parent company financial statements</td></tr><tr><td>Performance materiality</td><td>65% (March 2022: 60%) of Group materiality</td><td>65% (March 2022: 60%) of parent company materiality</td></tr><tr><td>Basis and rationale for determining performance materiality</td><td colspan="2">In determining performance materiality, we considered the following factors: 
a. Our experience of auditing the Group: this is the fifth year of our audit of the consolidated financial statements and fourth year of auditing the Group as a listed entity on the London Stock Exchange; 
b. Our ability to visit component management and component audit teams in India, Dubai and Africa during the year following the easing of Covid-related travel restrictions; and 
c. The maturity of the Group&#x27;s control environment. 
As a result of these factors, we increased performance materiality to 65% of Group materiality (March 2022: 60% of Group materiality). We applied the same approach in calculating parent company materiality.</td></tr></table>

# 6.3 Error reporting threshold

We agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of  $3.3m (March 2022:$ 3.1m), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit and Risk Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.

# Independent auditor's report to the members of Airtel Africa plc continued

# 7. An overview of the scope of our audit

# 7.1 Identification and scoping of components

Our component audit scope requires us to (a) achieve sufficient coverage across the Group to address the key risk areas and (b) meet the requirements of ISA (UK) 600 to plan and oversee the work performed by component audit teams. Our Group audit was scoped on an entity-level basis, assessing components against the risk of material misstatement at the Group level. We also considered the quantum of financial statement balances and individual financial transactions of a significant nature. In performing our assessment, we have considered the geographical spread of the Group and risks presented within each region.

The Group operates across fourteen countries across Africa (each were identified as a component for audit purposes) and supported by the Group's shared service centre based in India, as well as a key holding company based in the Netherlands (Bharti Airtel Netherlands B.V.) which holds a part of the Group's debt, and Airtel Africa plc, the company.

Component teams performed full scope audits on two components (Nigeria and Uganda) and audits of specified account balances on five components as set out in the table below. We performed interim audit procedures for the 9 months ended 31 December 2022 on Nigeria, Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, Malawi, Zambia and the DRC and additional procedures for the period to the year ended 31 March 2023.

For Congo B, Gabon, Niger, Chad, Seychelles, Rwanda and Madagascar we performed analytical review procedures at the Group level for the year ended 31 March 2023 as these components are not significant to the Group.

We performed a full scope audit on Airtel Africa plc and an audit of specified account balances on Bharti Airtel Netherlands B.V. A component audit team also performed procedures at the shared service centre in India. The scope of the shared service centre matched the scope of each African component e.g. the Nigeria transactions at the shared service centre were subject to a full scope audit.

The Group team performed analytical review procedures on the remaining balances not included within audit scope, each of which are insignificant. This included other holding companies within the Netherlands, including AMC B.V., the holding company of the main Airtel Money entities. We also made inquiries of management and evaluated and tested management's Group-wide controls across a range of locations and segments in order to address the risk of residual misstatement on a segment-wide and component basis. At the Group level, we also tested the consolidation process and performed procedures over significant risks and controls. We also assessed the accounting for key transactions in the year, as set out in note 5 to the financial statements.

The below table summarises the segment allocation and scope of the Group's components:  

<table><tr><td>Segment</td><td>Full scope audit</td><td>Audits of specified balances</td><td>Analytical review procedures</td></tr><tr><td>Nigeria</td><td>Nigeria</td><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>East Africa</td><td>Uganda</td><td>Tanzania, Malawi, Kenya and Zambia</td><td>Rwanda</td></tr><tr><td>Francophone</td><td>–</td><td>Democratic Republic of the Congo</td><td>Congo Brazzaville, Niger, Chad, Gabon, Madagascar and Seychelles</td></tr><tr><td>Central</td><td>Airtel Africa plc and shared service centre in India for the full scope components</td><td>Netherland holding company and shared service centre in India for other components in scope</td><td>Other components deemed insignificant to the Group</td></tr></table>

# 7.2 Our consideration of the control environment

# 7.2.1 IT controls

As a business, the Group is heavily reliant on IT systems. Therefore, effective IT controls are important not just to address financial risks, but also for other areas such as operational, regulatory and reputational risk. Given the high volume, low value nature of the Group's transactions, reliance on the IT control environment is a fundamental part of the audit approach, not least for revenue.

Our assessment of the IT control environment included testing general IT controls (such as user access and IT change management), automated controls (such as appropriate configuration of tariffs) and system generated reports (such as daily recharge reports).

Key systems in scope for the audit were the accounting and revenue recording systems (IN, Intec and Mobiquity), including revenue recording systems managed in country (such as those relating to prepaid, mobile money and interconnect revenue) and the Group's general ledger system. The Group is reliant on third parties for the support and maintenance of these systems, and arrangements are in place with a range of third-party IT providers.

# 7.2.2 Business processes

We previously relied on controls for our full scope audits and audits of specified balances over the prepaid revenue, interconnect revenue, mobile money revenue, expenditure and payables, property plant and equipment and payroll cycles. In the year we expanded this to cover reliance over the classification of legal and regulatory cases, the recording or leases and the consolidation processes following improvements in the controls of these areas.

# 7.2.3 Governance controls

We paid particular attention to the governance of the relationship with the company and entity level controls. We did not identify any significant findings in these areas.

# 7.3 Our consideration of climate-related risks

The Group has disclosed its Task force on climate-related financial disclosures ('TCFD') on pages 56-59 of the Annual Report, including its governance process for managing climate related risks, the climate related risks and opportunities and how these risks and opportunities are managed. We assessed the TCFD recommended disclosures within the Annual Report and considered whether they are materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained in the audit.

We obtained an understanding of management's process for considering the impact of climate-related risks. We evaluated these risks to assess whether they were complete and consistent with our understanding of the Group and our wider risk assessment procedures. The key focus was the impact of climate change on the impairment review performed on the Group's assets, particularly in respect of Goodwill. Management disclosed in note 15 that no reasonable possible change in any assumption underpinning the impairment review would lead to an impairment which includes the impact of climate change. We assessed this as part of our work on impairment and agree with the conclusions drawn.

# 7.4 Working with other auditors

The work on all components subject to either full audit or an audit of specified account balances was performed by Deloitte member firms. The majority of account balances are managed and audited at the shared service centre in India. This is supplemented by the management and audit of account balances at each operating company and the Group head office in Dubai.

We held a planning meeting in Dubai with all the component audit teams to discuss and agree the planning and execution of the audit; at the same meeting we met with Group management to communicate our planned audit strategy, including key audit focus areas.

As part of oversight procedures, we visited all the full scope components and all the components subject to audit of specified account balances (Nigeria, Uganda, the DRC, Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi and Zambia). We also visited Gabon and Congo Brazzaville components, which was subject to Group analytical review procedures, the shared service centre in India and the Group's head office in Dubai. We remained in regular contact with all component teams throughout the year to understand key issues and appropriately plan and execute the year end audit. The frequency of these interactions was increased during the key audit periods and included direct calls between senior members of the Group and component audit teams.

We issued detailed instructions to our component audit teams, included them within our team briefings and regular status calls, and reviewed component auditor working papers during the above component visits and remotely via online review of their audit files.

Throughout the core period of the audit, we held regular, and at times daily calls with Group management, which also involved Deloitte India, who audit the shared service centre in India and where the majority of account balances are managed.

# 8. Other information

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, including the strategic report, the corporate governance report, the directors' remuneration report and the directors' report, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

# We have nothing to report in this regard.

# 9. Responsibilities of directors

As explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group's and the company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

# Independent auditor's report to the members of Airtel Africa plc continued

# 10. Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC's website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.

# 11. Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.

# 11.1 Identifying and assessing potential risks related to irregularities

In identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations, we considered the following:

- the nature of the industry and sector, control environment and business performance, including the design of the Group's remuneration policies, key drivers for directors' remuneration, bonus levels and performance targets;  
- results of our enquiries of management, internal audit and the Audit and Risk committee about their own identification and assessment of the risks of irregularities, including those that are specific to the Group's sector;  
- any matters we identified having obtained and reviewed the Group's documentation of their policies and procedures relating to:

- identifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances of non-compliance;  
- detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud;  
- the internal controls established to mitigate risks of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations;

- the matters discussed among the audit engagement team, including significant component audit teams and involving relevant internal specialists, including tax, valuations, and IT specialists regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any potential indicators of fraud.

As a result of these procedures, we considered the opportunities and incentives that may exist within the organisation for fraud and identified the greatest potential for fraud in the following areas: prepaid and mobile money revenue, the existence of mobile money restricted cash and the classification of legal matters in components operating in certain jurisdictions. In common with all audits under ISAs (UK), we are also required to perform specific procedures to respond to the risk of management override.

We also obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that the Group operates in, focusing on provisions of those laws and regulations that had a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The key laws and regulations we considered in this context included the UK Companies Act and relevant tax legislation in the jurisdictions that the Group operates.

In addition, we considered provisions of other laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the financial statements but compliance with which may be fundamental to the Group's ability to operate or to avoid a material penalty. This primarily includes the regulations set by the telecommunication and mobile money regulator within each operating entity and the relevant financial regulations which govern the components.

# 11.2 Audit response to risks identified

As a result of performing the above, we identified prepaid and mobile money revenue, the existence of mobile money restricted cash and the classification of legal cases in components operating in certain jurisdictions as key audit matters related to the potential risk of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations. The key audit matters section of our report explains the matter in more detail and describes the specific procedures we performed in response to those key audit matters.

In addition to the above, our procedures to respond to risks identified included the following:

- reviewing the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with provisions of relevant laws and regulations described as having a direct effect on the financial statements;  
enquiring of management, the audit and risk committee and in-house legal counsel of actual and potential litigation and claims;  
- performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of material misstatement due to fraud;  
- reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, reviewing internal audit reports and reviewing correspondence with relevant tax authorities;  
- in addressing the risk of fraud through management override of controls, testing the appropriateness of journal entries, including enhanced testing of manual journal entries which demonstrate characteristics of audit interest; assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias; and evaluating the business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business.

We also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team members, including specialists and component audit teams and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout the audit.

# Report on other legal and regulatory requirements

# 12. Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006

In our opinion the part of the directors' remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

- the information given in the strategic report and the directors' report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and  
- the strategic report and the directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors' report.

# 13. Corporate governance statement

The Listing Rules require us to review the directors' statement in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Group's compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.

Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate Governance Statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit:

- the directors' statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material uncertainties identified set out on pages 123 and 178;  
- the directors' explanation as to its assessment of the Group's prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate set out on pages 98-99;  
- the directors' statement on fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 122;  
- the Board's confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks set out on page 90;  
- the section of the Annual Report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems set out on pages 90-97; and  
- the section describing the work of the Audit and Risk Committee set out on pages 117-127.

# 14. Matters on which we are required to report by exception

14.1 Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or  
- adequate accounting records have not been kept by the company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or  
- the company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.

# We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

# 14.2 Directors' remuneration

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors' remuneration have not been made or the part of the directors' remuneration report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.

# We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

# 15. Other matters which we are required to address

# 15.1 Auditor tenure

Following the recommendation of the audit and risk committee, we were appointed by the Board in April 2019 to audit the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2019 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement, including previous renewals and reappointments of the firm is five years, covering the years ended 31 March 2019 to 31 March 2023.  
15.2 Consistency of the audit report with the additional report to the Audit and Risk Committee

Our audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit and Risk Committee we are required to provide in accordance with ISAs (UK).

# 16. Use of our report

This report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose.

# 2. Summary of significant accounting policies

# 2.1 Basis of preparation

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and approved for use in the United Kingdom (UK) by the UK Accounting Standards Endorsement Board (UKEB).

All the amounts included in the financial statements are reported in United States dollars, with all values rounded to the nearest millions (\(m) except when otherwise indicated. Further, amounts which are less than half a million are appearing as '0'.

The accounting policies as set out in the following paragraphs of this note have been consistently applied by all the Group's entities to all the periods presented in these financial statements.

a. New and amended standards and interpretations that are effective for the current year

No new IFRS issued during the year are applicable to the Group. Amendments to existing IFRSs have been applied by the Group as required, however these amendments do not have any material impact on the Group's financial statements. The list of newly issued amendments is as follows:

- Amendments to IAS 37 in relation to 'Onerous contracts - cost of fulfilling contracts'.  
- Amendments to IAS 16 in relation to 'Proceeds before intended use of property, plant and equipment'.

# 2.2 Basis of measurement

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for financial instruments that are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period as explained in the accounting policies below. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services.

# Fair value measurement

Fair value is the price at the measurement date at which an asset can be sold, or the price paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.

The Group is required to classify the fair valuation method of the financial/non-financial assets and liabilities either measured or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements using a three level

fair-value hierarchy (which reflects the significance of inputs used in the measurement of fair value). Accordingly, the Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data is available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.

The three levels of the fair-value hierarchy are described below:

- Level 1 – fair values derived on the basis of quoted (unadjusted) prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.  
- Level 2 – fair values derived on the basis significant inputs other than quoted prices within Level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable.  
- Level 3 - fair values derived on the basis valuation techniques that used significant inputs that are not based upon observable market data (unobservable inputs).

# Going concern

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. In making this going concern assessment, the Group has considered cash flow projections to June 2024 (going concern assessment period) under both base and reasonable worst-case scenarios taking into considerations its principal risks and uncertainties, including a reduction in revenue and EBITDA and a significant devaluation of the various currencies in the countries in which the Group operates, including the Nigerian naira. As part of this evaluation, the Group has considered available ways to mitigate these risks and uncertainties and has also considered committed undrawn facilities of $525m expiring beyond the going concern assessment period, which will fulfil the Group's cash flow requirement under both the base and reasonable worst-case scenarios. Having considered all the factors above impacting the Group's businesses, the impact of downside sensitivities, and the mitigating actions available, including a reduction and deferral of capital expenditure, the directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to continue its operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

# 2.3 Basis of consolidation

# a. Subsidiaries

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the company and entities controlled by the company (its subsidiaries) up to 31 March each year. The Group controls an entity when it has power over the entity (that is, existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities), it is exposed to or has right to variable return from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls the entity, if the underlying facts and circumstances indicate a change in the above-mentioned parameters that determine the existence of control.

Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date when the Group obtains control and are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases. No subsidiaries are excluded from the Group consolidation. Non-controlling interests the equity in a subsidiary not attributable to the parent and is presented separately from equity attributable to the owners of the company. Non-controlling interests consist of the amount at the date of the business combination and its share of changes in equity since that date. Profit and loss and other comprehensive income/loss are attributed to the controlling and non-controlling interests in proportion to their ownership interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. However, in cases where there are binding contractual arrangements that determine the attribution of the earnings, the attribution specified by such arrangement is considered.

# 2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued

The Group has written a put option to non-controlling shareholders in one of the Group's subsidiaries to purchase their equity interest in the subsidiary, for cash and/or another financial assets. This gives rise to a financial liability for the present value of the likely redemption amount. This is the case even if the contract itself is an equity instrument or even if the obligation to purchase the equity interest is conditional on the counterparty exercising a right to redeem. The financial liability is recognised initially at the present value of the likely redemption amount by debiting equity ('Transactions with NCI reserve') while continuing to recognise the non-controlling interest if the non-controlling shareholders continue to have present access to returns on the underlying equity interest of the subsidiary. Subsequently, the financial liability is re-measured in accordance with IFRS 9. If the contract expires without delivery, the carrying amount of the financial liability is reclassified to equity ('Transactions with NCI reserve'). If the option is exercised, the corresponding non-controlling interest (if any) to the extent of shares re-acquired from non-controlling shareholders is de-recognised through equity ('Transactions with NCI reserve') at the time of exercise of the put option.

The profit/loss on disposal of a subsidiary (associated with loss of control) is recognised in profit and loss being the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest, and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of the deconsolidated entity, are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities of the subsidiary (i.e., reclassified to profit and loss or transferred to another category of equity as required/permitted by applicable IFRS). At such disposal any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value with the resultant change in carrying value being recognised in the profit and loss.

A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a change of control, is accounted for as a transaction with equity holders. Any difference between the amount of the adjustment to non-controlling interests and any consideration exchanged is recognised in 'the transactions with NCI reserve', within equity.

# b. Associate and joint venture (JV)

An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.

A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.

The Group's investments in its associate and joint venture are accounted for using the equity method from the date on which the Group starts exercising significant influence over the associate or joint control over the joint venture.

At each reporting date, the Group determines whether there is objective evidence that the investment is impaired. If there is such evidence, the Group calculates the amount of the impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the investment and its carrying value.

# c. Method of consolidation

The standalone financial statements of subsidiaries are fully consolidated on a line-by-line basis after adjusting for business combination adjustments. Intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset.

The Group's investments in its associate and JV are accounted for using the equity method. Accordingly, the investment is carried at cost less any impairment loss, as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Group's share of the net assets of the investee. Any excess of the cost over the Group's share of net assets in its associate/JV at the date of acquisition is presented as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment. The unrealised gains resulting from transactions with the associate/JV are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group's interest in the associate/JV. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.

Adjustments in respect of accounting policies of the Group's subsidiaries, associate and JV are made to ensure consistency with the accounting policies that are adopted by the Group.

# 2.4 Business combinations

The Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting; accordingly, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in the acquisition are recorded at their acquisition date fair values (except certain assets and liabilities which are required to be measured as per the applicable standards) and the non-controlling interest is initially recognised at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's net identifiable assets. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the aggregation of the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred or assumed and the equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.

The consideration transferred also includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability is subsequently measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit and loss. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not re-measured and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.

The excess of the consideration transferred, along with the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value (with the resulting difference being recognised in the profit and loss) of any previous equity interest in the acquiree, over the fair value of the Group's share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related costs are expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred.

If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete as at the reporting date in which the combination occurs, the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are measured at their provisional fair values at the date of acquisition.

Subsequent adjustments to the provisional values are made within the measurement period, if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and, if known, would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of that date, otherwise, the adjustments are recorded in the period in which they occur.

(All amounts are in US$ millions unless stated otherwise)

# 2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued

A contingent liability recognised in a business combination is initially measured at its fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, it is measured at the higher of:

(i) the amount that would be recognised in accordance with IAS 37, 'Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets', and  
(ii) the amount initially recognised less, where appropriate, cumulative amortisation recognised in accordance with IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers'.

# Common control transactions

Transfers involving entities or businesses in which all the combining entities or businesses are ultimately controlled by the same party or parties both before and after the business combination, (and that control is not transitory) are accounted for at their historic carrying values. The difference between the consideration paid/received and the historic carrying values is recorded in equity.

# 2.5 Foreign currency transactions

# a. Functional and presentation currency

The items included within the financial statements of each of the Group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which each entity operates (i.e., 'functional currency').

The financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is also the functional and presentation currency of the company.

# b. Transactions and balances

For the purpose of presenting the consolidated financial statements, transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the relevant functional currency at the rates prevailing at the date of the transaction.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the closing exchange rate prevailing as at the reporting date with the resulting foreign exchange differences on subsequent re-statement/settlement recognised in the profit and loss within finance costs/finance income. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevalent at the date of initial recognition (in case they are measured at historical cost) or at the date when the fair value is determined (in case they are measured at fair value) – with the resulting foreign exchange difference on subsequent re-statement/settlement recognised in the profit and loss, except to the extent that it relates to items for which gains and losses are recognised in the other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

The equity items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at historical exchange rates.

# c. Foreign operations

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations (including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of foreign entities) are translated into US dollars at the exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date. Items recognised in profit and loss are translated into US dollars at monthly average exchange rates, with equity translated at the historical rate. The resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and held within the foreign currency translation reserve (FCTR), a component of equity.

On disposal of a foreign operation (i.e., disposal of Group's entire interest in a foreign operation or disposal involving loss of control), all the accumulated exchange differences accumulated in FCTR in respect of that foreign operation is reclassified to profit and loss.

# d. Net investment in foreign operation

When a monetary item forms part of the Group's net investment in a foreign operation, the exchange differences are then recognised initially in other comprehensive income and are held within the foreign currency translation reserve (FCTR). Such FCTR is reclassified from equity to profit and loss on disposal of the foreign operation.

# 2.6 Current versus non-current classification

The Group classifies assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position as current or non-current.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities, and all assets and liabilities which are not 'current' (as discussed in the below paragraphs) are classified as non-current assets and liabilities.

An asset is classified as current when it is expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in the Group's normal operating cycle, held primarily for the purpose of trading, expected to be realised within 12 months after the reporting period, is a cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or is used to settle a liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period.

A liability is classified as current when it is expected to be settled in the Group's normal operating cycle, it is held primarily for the purpose of trading, it is due to be settled within 12 months after the reporting period, or the Group does not have the unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period.

# 2.7 Property, plant and equipment (PPE) and capital work-in-progress (CWIP)

The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised as an asset if, and only if, it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably.

PPE is initially recognised at cost. The initial cost of PPE comprises its purchase price (including non-refundable duties and taxes and after deducting trade discounts and rebates), and any directly attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition and location of its intended use. Further, it includes assets installed on the premises of customers where the associated risks, rewards and control remain with the Group.

Subsequent to initial recognition, PPE is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. When significant parts of PPE are required to be replaced at regular intervals, the Group recognises such parts as a separate component of each asset. When an item of PPE is replaced, its carrying amount is de-recognised from the statement of financial position and the cost of the new item of PPE is recognised.

The expenditure incurred after an item of PPE is ready to use, such as repairs and maintenance, is charged to the profit and loss in the period in which such costs are incurred. However, in situations where the expenditure can be measured reliably and it is probable that future economic benefits associated with it will flow to the Group, it is included in the asset's carrying value or as a separate asset, as appropriate.

Depreciation on PPE is computed using the straight-line method over the PPE's estimated useful lives.

# 2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued

Freehold land is not depreciated as it has an unlimited useful life. The Group has established the estimated range of useful lives for different categories of PPE as follows:

<table><tr><td>Categories</td><td>Years</td></tr><tr><td>Leasehold improvement</td><td>Period of lease or 
10-20 years, as 
applicable, whichever 
is less</td></tr><tr><td>Buildings</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Plant and equipment</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Network equipment (including passive 
infrastructure)</td><td>3-25</td></tr><tr><td>Computer</td><td>3-5</td></tr><tr><td>Furniture and fixture and office equipment</td><td>1-5</td></tr><tr><td>Vehicles</td><td>5</td></tr></table>

The useful lives, residual values and depreciation method of PPE are reviewed, and adjusted appropriately, at least at each financial year end so as to ensure that the method and period of depreciation are consistent with the expected pattern of economic benefits from these assets. The effect of any change in the estimated useful lives, residual values and/or depreciation method are accounted for prospectively, with depreciation calculated over the PPE's remaining revised useful life. The cost and the accumulated depreciation for PPE sold, scrapped, retired, or otherwise disposed of are de-recognised from the statement of financial position and the resulting gains/(losses) are included in the profit and loss within other income/other expenses, respectively.

PPE in the course of construction less any accumulated impairment is carried at cost and presented separately as CWIP (including capital advances) in the statement of financial position until ready for use at which point it is transferred to PPE and subsequently depreciated. Such cost comprises the purchase price (including non-refundable duties and taxes but excluding any trade discounts and rebates), and any other directly attributable costs.

# 2.8 Intangible assets

Identifiable intangible assets are recognised when the Group controls the asset, it is probable that future economic benefits attributed to the asset will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.

Goodwill represents the cost of the acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired (refer to Note 2.4). Goodwill is not amortised; however, it is tested for impairment (refer to Note 2.9) and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses if any. The gains/(losses) on the disposal of a cash-generating unit (group of CGUs) include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the group of CGUs sold. In case goodwill has been allocated to a group of CGUs, allocation of goodwill is determined based on the relative value of the operations sold in order to compute the gains/(losses).

Intangible assets that are acquired in a business combination are initially recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Other intangible assets are recognised at cost which includes their purchase price and cash price equivalent of deferred payments beyond normal credit terms, if any. Intangible assets with definite useful life are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses. Amortisation is computed using the straight-line method over the expected useful life.

Subsequent expenditure on intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates. All other expenditures are recognised in profit and loss as incurred.

The Group has established the estimated useful lives of different categories of intangible assets as follows:

# - Software

Software is amortised over the software licence period, generally not exceeding three years.

# - Licences (including spectrum)

Acquired licences and spectrum are amortised commencing from the date when the related network is available for intended use in the relevant jurisdiction over the relevant licence period. The useful lives generally range from two to twenty-five years.

In addition, the Group incurs a fee on licences/spectrum that is calculated based on the revenue of the licensee entity. These fees are recognised as a expense in profit and loss when incurred.

# - Other acquired intangible assets

Other acquired intangible assets include customer relationships which are amortised over the estimated life of such relationships generally ranging from one year to five years.

The useful lives and the amortisation method is reviewed and adjusted appropriately, at least at each financial year end, so as to ensure that the method and period of amortisation is consistent with the expected pattern of economic benefits from these assets. The effect of any change in the estimated useful lives and/or amortisation method is accounted for prospectively, and accordingly, amortisation is calculated over the remaining revised useful life.

Further, the cost of intangible assets under development is presented separately in the statement of financial position and includes spectrums/ licences allotted to the Group and related costs for which services are yet to be rolled out.

# - Internally-generated intangible assets - research and development expenditure

Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.

An internally-generated intangible asset arising from development (or from the development phase of an internal project) is recognised if, and only if, all of the following conditions have been met:

- The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale.  
- The intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it.  
- The ability to use or sell the intangible asset.  
- The intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits.  
- The availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset.  
- The ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development.

The amount initially recognised for internally-generated intangible assets is the sum of the expenditure incurred from the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria listed above. Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised in profit and loss in the period in which it is incurred.

Subsequent to initial recognition, internally-generated intangible assets are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.

# 2.9 Impairment of non-financial assets

# a. Goodwill

Goodwill is tested for impairment, at least annually or earlier, in case circumstances indicate that the carrying value may exceed the recoverable amount (higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use). For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to a cash-generating-unit (CGU) or group of CGUs (CGUs) which are expected to benefit from the acquisition-related synergies and represent the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, but not higher than an operating segment. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets.

Impairment occurs when the carrying value of a CGU/CGUs, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the CGU/CGUs. The recoverable amount of a CGU/CGUs is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of future cash flows expected to be derived from the CGU/CGUs.

The total impairment loss of a CGU/CGUs is allocated first to reduce the carrying value of goodwill allocated to that CGU/CGUs and then to the other assets of that CGU/CGUs – on a pro-rata basis of the carrying value of each asset.

b. Property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets, intangible assets and intangible assets under development

At each reporting period date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its PPE, right-of-use assets, CWIP and finite-lived intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. Intangible assets under development are tested for impairment, at least annually or earlier, in case circumstances indicate that it may be impaired.

For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (that is, higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use) is determined on an individual asset basis, unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets, in which case the recoverable amount is determined at the CGU level to which the asset belongs. If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss representing the excess of recoverable value over the carrying value of the asset/CGU is recognised immediately in profit and loss.

# c. Reversal of impairment losses

Impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset's or CGU's recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the profit and loss.

# 2.10 Financial instruments

a. Recognition, classification and presentation

Financial instruments are recognised in the statement of financial position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument.

The Group determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition.

The Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories:

those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income, or through profit or loss); and  
those to be measured at amortised cost.

The classification depends on the entity's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows.

The Group's business model for managing financial assets refers to how it manages its financial assets in order to generate cash flows. The business model determines whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash flows, selling the financial assets, or both. Financial assets classified and measured at amortised cost are held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows while financial assets classified and measured at fair value through OCI are held within a business model with the objective of both holding to collect contractual cash flows and selling. The Group does not have any financial instruments classified as fair value through other comprehensive income.

The Group has classified all non-derivative financial liabilities as measured at amortised cost.

Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety for determining the contractual terms of the cash flow and accordingly, embedded derivatives are not separated. However, derivatives embedded in non-financial instrument/financial liability (measured at amortised cost) host contracts are classified as separate derivatives if their economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contracts.

Financial assets and liabilities arising from different transactions are offset against each other and the resultant net amount is presented in the statement of financial position if, and only when, the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the related recognised amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

The amounts held by electronic account holders in their mobile money wallets are presented separately in the balance sheet as 'mobile money wallet balance'. The amounts held in bank on behalf of such electronic account holders are restricted for use by the Group and are presented as 'balance held under mobile money trust'.

b. Measurement - non-derivative financial instruments I. Initial measurement

Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, except for trade receivables that do not have a significant financing component which are measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in profit or loss.

# 2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued

The transaction price is generally the best evidence of the financial instrument's initial fair value. However, it is possible for an entity to determine that the instrument's fair value is not the transaction price. The difference between the transaction amount and the fair value (if any) is accounted for as follows:

- The difference is recognised as a gain or loss in the profit and loss only if fair value is evidenced by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or liability (that is, a Level 1 input) or based on a valuation technique that uses only data from observable markets.  
- In all other cases, an entity recognises the instrument at fair value and defers the difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price in the Statement of Financial Position.

# II. Subsequent measurement – financial assets

The subsequent measurement of non-derivative financial assets depends on their classification as follows:

# Financial assets measured at amortised cost

Assets that are held for the collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method (if the impact of discounting/any transaction costs is significant). Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income.

EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash receipts or payments (including all fees and transaction costs that form an integral part of the effective interest rate) over the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset or to the amortised cost of a financial liability.

# Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)

All equity instruments and financial assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) are measured at FVTPL. Interest (based on the EIR method) and dividend income from financial assets at FVTPL is recognised in profit and loss within finance income/finance costs separately from the other gains/losses arising from changes in the fair value.

# Impairment

The company assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its assets carried at amortised cost and debt instruments carried at FVTOCI. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. If credit risk has not increased significantly, 12-month expected credit loss (ECL) is used to provide for impairment loss, otherwise, lifetime ECL is used.

However, in case of trade receivables and contract assets, the Group applies the simplified approach which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.

# III. Subsequent measurement – financial liabilities

Financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method (if the impact of discounting/any transaction costs is significant).

# c. Measurement - derivative financial instruments

Derivative financial instruments, including separated embedded derivatives, that are not designated as hedging instruments in a hedging relationship are classified as financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value. They are subsequently measured at their fair value, with changes in fair value being recognised in profit and loss within finance income/finance costs.

In cases, where the initial fair value is evidenced neither by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or liability nor based on observable inputs, on subsequent measurement, the difference between initial fair value and transaction price is recognised in profit and loss on an appropriate basis (e.g., straight-line) over the life of the instrument but no later than when the valuation is wholly supported by observable market data or the transaction is closed out.

# d. Hedging activities

# I. Fair value hedge

Some of the Group's entities may use derivative financial instruments (e.g., interest rate swaps) to manage/mitigate their exposure to the risk of change in the fair value of borrowings. The Group may designate certain interest swaps to hedge the risk of changes in fair value of recognised borrowings attributable to the hedged interest rate risk. The effective and ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in profit and loss within finance income/finance costs, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged liability that is attributable to the hedged risk. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item is amortised to profit and loss over the period of the remaining maturity of the hedged item. The amortisation is based on the recalculated effective interest rate.

# II. Cash flow hedge

Some of the Group's entities may use derivative financial instruments (e.g., foreign currency forwards, options, swaps) to manage their exposure to foreign exchange and price risk. Further, the Group may designate certain derivative financial instruments (or its components) as hedging instruments for hedging the exchange rate risk attributable to either a recognised item or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge). The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments (or its components) that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, are recognised in other comprehensive income and is held within the cash flow hedge reserve (CFHR) – within other components of equity. Any gains/(losses) relating to the ineffective portion are recognised immediately in profit and loss within finance income/finance costs. The amounts accumulated in cash flow hedge reserve are accounted for, depending on the nature of the underlying hedged transaction. If the hedged transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial item, the amount accumulated in equity is removed from the separate component of equity and included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability. This is not a reclassification adjustment and will not be recognised in OCI for the period.

For any other cash flow hedges, the amount accumulated in OCI (in CFHR) is reclassified to profit and loss as a reclassification adjustment in the same period or periods during which the hedged cash flows affect profit and loss.

If cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued, the amount that has been accumulated in OCI (in CFHR) remains in accumulated OCI (in CFHR) if the hedged future cash flows are still expected to occur. Otherwise, the amount will be immediately reclassified to profit and loss as a reclassification adjustment.

After discontinuation, once the hedged cash flow occurs, any amount remaining in accumulated OCI (in CFHR) must be accounted for depending on the nature of the underlying transaction as described above.

# Notes to consolidated financial statements continued

(All amounts are in US$ millions unless stated otherwise)

# 2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued

# III. Net investment hedge

The Group may hedge its net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. On doing so, any foreign exchange differences on the hedging instrument (e.g., borrowings) relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income within the foreign currency translation reserve (FCTR) – within other components of equity, so as to offset the change in the value of the net investment being hedged. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges is immediately recognised in profit and loss. The amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit and loss when the foreign operation is disposed.

# Derecognition

A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e., removed from the Group's consolidated statement of financial position) when:

- The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or  
- The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a pass-through arrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if, and to what extent, it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Group continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of its continuing involvement. In that case, the Group also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Group has retained.

A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in profit and loss.

# 2.11 Leases

At inception of a contract, the Group assesses a contract as, or containing, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Group assesses whether the contract involves the use of an identified asset, the Group has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset throughout the period of use, and the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset.

# a. Group as a lessee

The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease agreements in which it is the lessee, in the statement of financial position. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted by using the rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate. Lease liabilities include the net present value of fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), variable lease payments that are based on consumer price index (CPI),

the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and payments of penalties for terminating the lease if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option.

Subsequently, the lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments, including changes in CPI or if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option or when the lease contract is modified and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease. The corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit and loss if the carrying amount of the related right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received, any initial direct costs, and restoration costs.

Subsequent to initial recognition, right-of-use assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the useful life of the underlying asset or the end of the lease term, whichever is shorter. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of the underlying asset.

In the statement of financial position, the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are presented separately.

When a contract includes lease and non-lease components, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract on the basis of the relative stand-alone prices of each lease component and the aggregate stand-alone price of the non-lease components.

# Short-term leases

The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less. The Group recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

# Sale and leaseback

In sale and leaseback transactions, the Group first considers whether the initial transfer of the underlying asset to the buyer-lessor is a sale by applying the requirements of IFRS 15. If the transfer qualifies as a sale and the transaction is on market terms, the Group derecognises the asset, recognises a right-of-use asset (and lease liabilities) and recognises a portion of the total gain or loss on the sale in the profit and loss. The right-of-use asset is recognised at the proportion of the previous carrying amount of the asset that relates to the right of use retained by the seller-lessee. The amount recognised is calculated by splitting the total gain or loss into:

- an amount recognised in the profit and loss relating to the buyer-lessor's rights in the underlying asset, and  
- an unrecognised amount relating to the rights retained by the seller-lessee which is deferred by way of reducing the right-of-use assets initially recognised.

# b. Group as a lessor

Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

When a contract includes lease and non-lease components, the Group applies IFRS 15 to allocate the consideration under the contract to each component.

# 2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued

The Group enters into 'indefeasible right to use' (IRU) arrangements wherein the right to use the assets is given over the substantial part of the asset life. However, as the title to the assets and the significant risks associated with the operation and maintenance of these assets remains with the Group, such arrangements are recognised as an operating lease. The contracted price is recognised as revenue during the tenure of the agreement. Unearned IRU revenue received in advance is presented as deferred revenue within liabilities in the statement of financial position.

# 2.12 Taxes

The income tax expense comprises current and deferred income tax. Income tax is recognised in the profit and loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised outside profit and loss, in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the related income tax is also recognised accordingly within other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

# a. Current tax

Current tax is calculated on the basis of the tax rates, laws and regulations, which have been enacted or substantively enacted as at the reporting date in the respective countries where the Group entities operate and generate taxable income. The payments made in excess/(shortfall) of the respective Group entities' income tax obligation for the respective periods are recognised in the statement of financial position under income tax assets/income tax liabilities, respectively.

Any interest relating to accrued liabilities for potential tax assessments is not included in the income tax charge or (credit), but is recognised within finance costs.

A provision is recognised for those matters for which the tax determination is uncertain but it is considered probable that there will be a future outflow of funds to a tax authority. These provisions are measured at the best estimate of the amount expected to become payable or based on the expected value approach, as applicable and are presented within current tax liabilities. The assessment is based on the judgement of tax professionals within the company supported by previous experience in respect of such activities and in certain cases based on specialist independent tax advice.

Current tax assets and tax liabilities are offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

# b. Deferred tax

Deferred tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values in the financial statements. However, deferred tax is not recognised if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit (tax loss). Further, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences, tax losses and tax credits can be utilised. To assess such probability, the Group considers profit generation capability of the taxable entity based on historical trends as well as forecast profitability for the foreseeable future. When it is probable that there will be future taxable profits, an evaluation is performed to assess the availability of sufficient deductible temporary differences during the foreseeable future, relating to the same taxation authority and in the same taxable entity.

Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, associate and joint venture unless the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets, recognised and unrecognised, are reviewed at each reporting date and assessed for recoverability based on best estimates of taxable profits for the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and where the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority.

# 2.13 Inventories

Group's inventories include handsets, modems and related accessories.

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (determined using the first-in-first-out method) and net realisable value. The costs comprise its purchase price and any directly attributable cost of bringing it to its present location and condition. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated variable costs necessary to make the sale.

# 2.14 Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, wallet balances, bank balances, cheques in hand and any deposits with original maturities of three months or less (i.e., that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and cash equivalents, and subject to an insignificant risk of a change in value). However, for the purpose of the statement of cash flows, in addition to the above items, any bank overdrafts that are an integral part of the Group's cash management and balances held under mobile money trust are also included as a component of cash and cash equivalents.

Term deposits with an original maturity of more than three months are presented within other bank balances.

# 2.15 Non-current assets (or disposal groups) held for sale

Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as assets-held-for-sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable. The sale is considered highly probable only when the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition, it is unlikely that the sale will be withdrawn and the sale is expected to complete within one year from the date of classification as held for sale. Disposal groups classified as held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell, except for assets such as deferred tax assets (measured in accordance with IAS 12) and financial assets which are measured at fair value in accordance with IFRS 9. Non-current assets are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held for sale.

Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately in the statement of financial position.

A loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset (or disposal group) to fair value less costs to sell. A gain is recognised for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell of an asset (or disposal group), but not in excess of any cumulative loss previously recognised.

If the criteria for held for sale are no longer met, it ceases to be classified as held for sale and is measured at the lower of (i) its carrying amount before the asset was classified as held for sale, adjusted for any depreciation/amortisation that would have been recognised had that asset not been classified as held for sale, and (ii) its recoverable amount at the date when the disposal group ceases to be classified as held for sale.

# 2.16 Share capital/share premium

Ordinary shares are classified as equity when the Group has an unconditional right to avoid delivery of cash or another financial asset, that is, when the dividend and repayment of capital are at the sole and absolute discretion of the Group and there is no contractual obligation whatsoever to that effect. The share premium account is used to record the premium on issue of shares.

# 2.17 Employee benefits

The Group's employee benefits mainly include wages, salaries, bonuses, defined contribution plans, defined benefit plans, other long-term benefits, including compensated absences and share-based payments. The employee benefits are recognised in the year in which the associated services are rendered by the Group employees. Short-term employee benefits are recognised in profit and loss at undiscounted amounts during the period in which the related services are rendered. Details of long-term employee benefits are provided below:

# - Defined contribution plans

The contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised in profit and loss as and when the services are rendered by employees. The Group has no further obligations under these plans beyond its periodic contributions.

# - Defined benefit plans

The Group has defined benefit plans in the form of 'retirement benefits' and 'severance pay' wherein the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each interim reporting period. The obligation towards these benefits is recognised in the statement of financial position under provisions, at the present value of the defined benefit obligations. The present value of these obligations is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows, using an appropriate discount rate.

Defined benefit costs are split into the following categories:

- service costs, which includes current service cost, past service cost and gains and losses on curtailments and settlements;  
- interest expense; and  
- remeasurements.

The Group recognises service costs within profit and loss as employee benefit expenses. Past service cost is recognised in profit and loss when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs. Gains or losses on settlement of a defined benefit plan are recognised when the settlement occurs. Interest cost is calculated by applying a discount rate to the defined benefit liability and is recognised within finance costs. Remeasurements comprising actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately as a charge or credit to other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurements recognised in other comprehensive income are subsequently not reclassified to profit and loss.

# - Other long-term employee benefits

The employees of the Group are entitled to compensated absences as well as other long-term benefits. Compensated absences benefit comprises encashment and the availing of leave balances that were earned by the employees over the period of past employment.

The Group provides for the liability (presented under provisions) towards these benefits on the basis of actuarial valuations carried out quarterly as at the reporting date, by an independent qualified actuary using the projected-unit-credit method. The related re-measurements are recognised in the profit and loss in the period in which they arise.

# - Share-based payments

Refer to Note below.

# 2.18 Share-based payments

The Group operates equity-settled and cash-settled compensation plans under which the Group receives services from employees as consideration for equity shares/cash-settled units.

The Group measures the fair value of the services received from employees by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted. The grant-date fair value of equity-settled share-based payment arrangements is generally recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis, with a corresponding increase in equity (reserves), over the vesting period of the awards.

At each reporting date, the Group estimates the number of equity instruments expected to eventually vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. The impact of the revision of the original estimates of the number of equity instruments expected to vest, if any, is recognised in profit and loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to reserves.

The fair value of the amount payable to employees in respect of share-based payments which are settled in cash is recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment. The liability is remeasured at each reporting date and at settlement date based on the fair value of such instruments. Any changes in the liability are recognised in profit and loss.

As at each reporting date, the Group estimates the number of awards that are expected to eventually vest. It recognises the impact of any revision to original estimates in the period of change. Accordingly, no expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for where vesting is conditional upon a market performance/non-vesting condition. These are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market/non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that service conditions and all other non-market performance conditions are satisfied.

Where the terms of an award are modified, in addition to the expense pertaining to the original award, an incremental expense is recognised for any modification that results in additional fair value, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.

For further details of equity-settled and cash-settled compensation plans refer to Note 7.

# - Treasury shares

The company is the sponsoring entity of an Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) which is controlled by the Group. The company provides funds to the EBT to enable it to satisfy its objectives. The company's equity instruments held by the EBT are accounted for as if they were the company's own equity and are treated as treasury shares. Such treasury shares are recorded at cost and deducted from equity. Refer to Note 26.1 for details of treasury shares held by the EBT.

# 2.19 Provisions

# a. General

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated.

Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the relevant obligation, using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money (if the impact of discounting is significant) and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to un-winding of the discounting due to the passage of time is recognised within finance costs.

# 2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued

b. Provision for legal, tax and regulatory matters

The Group is involved in various legal, tax and regulatory matters, the outcome of which may not be favourable to the Group. Management, in consultation with legal, tax and other advisers where required, assesses the likelihood that a pending claim will succeed against the Group. The Group recognises a provision in cases where it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligations arising from such claims.

c. Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO)

AROs are recognised for those lease arrangements where the Group has an obligation at the end of the lease period to restore the leased premises to a condition similar to that at inception of the lease. AROs are provided at the present value of expected costs to settle the obligation and are recognised as part of the cost of that particular asset. The estimated future costs of decommissioning are reviewed annually and any change in the estimated future costs or in the discount rate applied are adjusted against the cost of the asset.

# 2.20 Contingencies

A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but probably will not, require an outflow of resources. When there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in respect of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made. Contingent assets are not recognised unless virtually certain and disclosed only where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.

# 2.21 Revenue

Revenue is recognised upon the transfer of control of promised products or services to the customer at the consideration which the Group has received or expects to receive in exchange for those products or services, net of any taxes/duties and discounts. When determining the consideration to which the Group is entitled for providing promised products or services via intermediaries, the Group assesses whether the intermediary is a principal or agent in the onward sale to the end customer. To the extent that the intermediary is considered a principal, the consideration to which the Group is entitled is determined to be that receivable from the intermediary. To the extent that the intermediary is considered to be an agent, the consideration to which the Group is entitled is determined to be the amount receivable from the ultimate customer. Any upfront discount or commission provided to the intermediary is recognised as a cost of sale in such a case.

The Group has entered into certain multiple-element revenue arrangements, which involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services or right-of-use assets. At the inception of the arrangement, all the deliverables within the contract are evaluated to determine whether they represent distinct performance obligations, and if so, they are accounted for separately.

Total consideration related to the multiple element arrangements is allocated to each performance obligation based on their relative standalone selling prices. The stand-alone selling prices are the prices at which the Group would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer.

Revenue is recognised when, or as, each distinct performance obligation is satisfied. The main categories of revenue and the basis of recognition are as follows:

# Service revenue

Service revenue is derived from the provision of telecommunications and mobile money services to customers. The majority of the Group's customers subscribe to services on a pre-paid basis.

Telecommunications service revenue mainly pertains to usage, subscription charges for voice, data, messaging and value-added services and customer onboarding charges.

Telecommunications services are considered to represent a single performance obligation as all are provided over the Group's network and transmitted as data representing a digital signal on the network. The transmission consumes network bandwidth and therefore, irrespective of the nature of the communication, the customer ultimately receives access to the network and the right to consume network bandwidth.

Customers primarily pay in advance for services of the Group. These cash amounts are recognised in deferred income in the consolidated statement of financial position and transferred to the profit and loss when the service obligation has been performed/when the usage of services becomes remote.

The Group recognises revenue from these services over time as they are provided. Revenue is recognised over time based on actual units of telecommunications services provided during the reporting period as a proportion of the total units of telecommunications services to be provided.

Subscription charges are recognised over the subscription pack validity period.

Revenue recognised in excess of amounts invoiced are classified as unbilled revenue. If amounts invoiced/collected from a customer are in excess of revenue recognised, a deferred revenue/advance income is recognised.

Service revenue also includes revenue from interconnection/roaming charges for use of the Group's network by other operators for voice, data, messaging and signalling services.

Revenue from long distance operations comprise voice services and bandwidth services (including installation), which are recognised on the provision of services, provided over the period of the respective arrangements.

The Group has interconnect agreements with local and foreign operators. This allows customers from either network to originate or terminate calls to each other's network. Revenue is earned and recognised as per bilateral agreements when other operators' calls are terminated to the Group's network, i.e., when the service is rendered.

As part of the mobile money services, the Group earns commission from merchants for facilitating recharges, bill payments and other merchant payments. It also earns commissions on the transfer of money from one customer wallet to another. Such commission is recognised as revenue at a point in time on fulfilment of these services by the Group.

# Sale of products

Equipment sales mainly pertain to sale of telecommunications equipment and related accessories for which revenue is recognised when the control of equipment is transferred to the customer, i.e., transferred at a point in time.

Costs to obtain or fulfil a contract with a customer

The Group defers costs to obtain or fulfil a contract with a customer over expected average customer life determined based on churn rate specific to such contracts.

# 2.22 Borrowing costs

Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that the Group incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing costs which are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset (that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale) are expensed in the period they occur.

# 2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued

# 2.23 Operating profit

Operating profit is stated as revenue less operating expenditure, including depreciation and amortisation and operating exceptional items. Operating profit excludes finance income, finance costs, other non-operating income and share of profit of the associate and joint venture accounted for using equity method.

# 2.24 Exceptional items - Alternative performance measures (APMs)

Management exercises judgement in determining the adjustments to apply to IFRS measurements in order to derive APMs, which provide additional useful information on the underlying trends, performance and position of the Group. This assessment covers the nature of the item being one-off or non-routine and the significance of the impact of that item on reported performance in accordance with the Group's exceptional items policy.

To monitor performance, the Group uses the following APMs:

- 'Underlying profit before tax' representing profit before tax for the period, excluding the impact of exceptional items.  
- 'Underlying profit after tax' representing profit after tax for the period, excluding the impact of exceptional items and tax on exceptional items.

Exceptional items refer to items of income or expense within the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, which are of such size, nature or incidence that their exclusion is considered necessary to explain the performance of the Group and improve the comparability between periods. Reversals of previous exceptional items are also considered as exceptional items. When applicable, these items include network modernisation, share issue expenses, loan prepayment costs, the settlement of legal and regulatory cases, restructuring costs, impairments, gain on sale of tower assets and initial recognition of deferred tax assets. A breakdown of the exceptional items included in the profit and loss is disclosed in Note 11.

For other APMs, refer pages 240-245.

# 2.25 Dividends

Dividends to shareholders of the company are deducted from retained earnings and recognised as a liability, in the year in which the dividends are approved by the shareholders. Interim dividends are deducted from the retained earnings when they are paid.

# 2.26 Earnings per share (EPS)

The Group presents the basic and diluted EPS data. Basic EPS is computed by dividing the profit for the period attributable to the owners of the company by the weighted average number of shares net of any treasury shares outstanding during the period.

Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account:

- the after-income tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares, and  
- the weighted average number of additional ordinary shares that would have been outstanding assuming the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.

# 3. Critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements

The estimates and judgements used in the preparation of these financial statements are continuously evaluated by the Group, and are based on historical experience and various other assumptions and factors (including expectations of future events), that the Group believes to be reasonable under the existing circumstances. These estimates and judgements are based on the facts and events that existed as at the reporting date, or that occurred after that date but provide additional evidence about conditions existing as at the reporting date.

Although the Group regularly assesses these estimates, actual results could differ materially from these estimates (even if the assumptions underlying such estimates were reasonable when made), if these results differ from historical experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate. The changes in estimates are recognised in the financial statements in the year in which they become known.

# 3.1 Key sources of estimation uncertainty

The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying values of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below:

# Uncertain tax treatments

Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations. Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and the assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded. The Group establishes provisions/contingencies, based on reasonable estimates, for potential audits by the tax authorities in the respective countries in which it operates as well as where the probability of tax authorities accepting the Group's treatment is in doubt. The amount of direct tax provisions carried as part of current tax liabilities amounted to  $15m and contingencies amounted to$ 16m (refer to Note 29). Reflecting the complexities of tax regulations and international business relationships, as described above, the Group receives, from time to time, demands from tax authorities. The Group assesses these demands and estimates whether a provision should be recorded or a contingent liability should be disclosed or whether the matter is considered to be remote. These estimates are based on various factors, such as experience from previous tax audits and the Group's interpretation of tax regulations by the taxable entity and the relevant tax authority. For those demands where the Group believes there is a low likelihood of the demand being successful against the Group, no provision is recorded nor a contingent liability is disclosed. However, these estimates may be subject to a material change within the next financial year which could lead to the recognition of additional material provisions or the disclosure of additional material contingent liabilities.

# Contingent liabilities and provisions

The Group is involved in various legal, indirect tax and regulatory matters, the outcome of which may not be favourable to the Group. Management, in consultation with legal, indirect tax and other advisers where required, assesses the likelihood that a pending claim will succeed. The Group has applied its judgement and has recognised liabilities based on whether additional amounts will be payable and has included contingent liabilities where economic outflows are considered possible but not probable. The Group carried provisions amounting to

# 3. Critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements continued

$30m in respect of indirect tax, legal and regulatory matters and discloses contingencies amounting to$ 116m. In recording or disclosing these amounts, the Group has estimated which claims are probable and consequently has recorded a provision for those. For the claims which are possible, the Group has disclosed a contingent liability. For claims which are considered to be remote, no recording or disclosure has been made. However, given the nature of these matters and size of such claims there may be a risk of a material change within the next financial year, including the recognition of additional provisions, should the Group not be successful in defending the cases where contingent liabilities are disclosed. For further details, refer to Notes 25 and 29, respectively.

# 3.2 Critical judgements in applying the Group's accounting policies

There were no critical accounting judgments that would have a significant effect on the amount recognised in the Group's financial statements.

# 4. New accounting pronouncements to be adopted on or after 1 April 2023

The following pronouncements issued by the IASB are relevant to the Group and effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. The Group's financial statements will be presented in accordance with these requirements, which are being evaluated but are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated results, financial position or cash flows of the Group. These pronouncements have been issued by IASB but have not yet been adopted by UKEB for use in the UK.

- Amendments to IFRS 16 in relation to Sale and leaseback accounting.  
- Amendments to IAS 1 in relation to 'classification of liabilities as current and non-current'.  
- Amendments to IAS 12 in relation to 'deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction'.  
- Amendments to IAS 8 in relation to Accounting Estimates.  
- Amendments to IAS 1 in relation to disclosure of accounting policies.

# 5. Significant transactions/new developments

a) The directors recommended and shareholders approved a final dividend of 3 cents per ordinary share for the year ended 31 March 2022, which was paid on 22 July 2022 to the holders of ordinary shares on the register of members at the close of business on 24 June 2022.

An interim dividend of 2.18 cents per share was also approved by the Board on 26 October 2022, which has been paid on 08 December 2022.

b) In April 2022, one of the Airtel Mobile Commerce B.V.'s (AMC B.V.) subsidiaries, SmartCash Payment Service Bank Limited ('SmartCash'), received the final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria for a full Payment Service Bank licence affording it the opportunity to deliver a full suite of mobile money services in Nigeria.

Later in August 2022, in line with the directions of the Central Bank of Nigeria, SmartCash was transferred to Airtel Networks Limited (a subsidiary of Airtel Africa Group, outside the perimeter of AMC B.V. Group). Airtel Africa Group has agreed with non-controlling investors to compensate them for their respective potential loss of value by

way of transferring additional AMC B.V. shares equivalent to the value of SmartCash on the prescribed trigger event date (subject to a cap of  $5\%$  of the value of AMC B.V. Group), which will only be payable in the event that SmartCash does not again form part of the AMC B.V. Group perimeter or the non-controlling investors do not own a direct shareholding in SmartCash based on regulatory approvals, by the prescribed trigger event date.

Given that the proposal to compensate the non-controlling investors is agreed, for their economic value loss due to exclusion of SmartCash (which they were entitled to before the transfer of SmartCash to Airtel Nigeria Limited) based on the future fair value of SmartCash on the prescribed trigger event date, Airtel Africa Group continues to recognise non-controlling interest with respect to net assets of SmartCash.

c) In June 2022, the Group announced the acquisition by Airtel Congo RDC S.A, a subsidiary of the Group, of 58 MHz of additional spectrum spread across the 900, 1800, 2100, and 2600 MHz bands for a gross consideration of  $42m. An amount of$ 20m pertaining to the 900, 1800 and 2100 MHz bands has been capitalized as an intangible asset and $22m pertaining to the 2600 MHz bands is carried as intangible asset under development since these bands are not yet available for use (expected to be available for use by June 2023).  
d) On 7 July 2022, Bharti Airtel International (Netherlands) B.V., one of the Group's subsidiaries, completed the early redemption of  $450m of its$ 1bn of 5.35% guaranteed senior notes due in 2024 for a consideration of $463m. The consideration included accrued interest up to the date of redemption and early redemption cost.  
e) In July 2022, the Group announced the acquisition by Airtel Kenya, a subsidiary of the Group, of  $60\mathrm{MHz}$  of additional spectrum in the 2600 MHz band from the Communications Authority of Kenya, for a gross consideration of  $\$40$ m. The spectrum is valid from July 2022 for a period of 15 years. This cost has been capitalised as an intangible asset.  
f) In October 2022, the Group announced the acquisition by Airtel Tanzania, a subsidiary of the Group, of 110 MHz of additional spectrum spread across the 2600 MHz (two blocks of 2x15 MHz) and 3500 MHz bands from the Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority (TCRA) for a gross consideration of $60m. The spectrum is being carried as an intangible under development, since it is not available for use yet (expected to be available for use by August 2023).  
g) In October 2022, the Group announced the acquisition by Airtel Zambia, a subsidiary of the Group, of 60 MHz of additional spectrum spread across the 800 MHz and 2600 MHz bands from the Zambia Information and Communications Technology Authority (ZICTA), for a gross consideration of $29m which has been capitalised as an intangible asset.  
h) In December 2022, the Group paid \(317m (in Nigerian naira) to acquire 100 MHz of spectrum in the 3500 MHz band and 2x5 MHz of 2600 MHz band from the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC). The 2600 MHz and 3500 MHz spectrum licences are valid for a period of 10 years from January and July 2023, respectively. The spectrum has been carried as an intangible under development, since it is not yet available for use (expected to be available for use by July 2023).  
i) During the year, Airtel Nigeria, a subsidiary of the Group, was offered renewal of 2100 MHz spectrum license by Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) for a gross consideration of  $127\mathrm{m}$ , which was accepted by Airtel Nigeria. This cost was capitalised as an intangible asset and is being amortised over the useful life of the spectrum of 15 years. A corresponding liability was created for the amount payable for the renewal which has been subsequently paid in April 2023.

# 6.1 Segmental information

The Group's segment information is provided on the basis of geographical clusters and products to the chief executive officer (chief operating decision maker – 'CODM') for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of performance.

The Group's reporting segments till 31 March 2022 were as follows:

Nigeria – comprising operations in Nigeria.

East Africa – comprising operations in Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.

Francophone Africa – comprising operations in Chad, Gabon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, Niger, Republic of the Congo and the Seychelles.

Owing to significant growth in the Group's mobile money business and a corresponding change in the organisation structure combined with changes in information provided to the CODM for the allocation of resources and the assessment of performance, with effect from April 2022, the Group has identified mobile money as a new operating and reportable segment. Thus, the segments for the Group are now as follows:

Nigeria mobile services – comprising of mobile service operations in Nigeria.

East Africa mobile services – comprising of mobile service operations in Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.

Francophone Africa mobile services – comprising of mobile service operations in Chad, Gabon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, Niger, Republic of the Congo and the Seychelles.

Mobile money - comprising of mobile money services across the Group, including the recently launched payment service bank in Nigeria.

* Mobile money segment consolidates the results of mobile money operations from all operating entities within the Group. Airtel Money Commerce B.V. (AMC B.V.) is the holding company for all mobile money services for the Group, and as of 31 March 2023, it consolidates mobile money operations from eleven OpCos, currently excluding operations in Nigeria, Tanzania, and Republic of the Congo. It is management's intention to continue work to transfer all these remaining mobile money services operations into AMC B.V., subject to local regulatory requirements.

# 6. Revenue continued

Each segment derives revenue from the respective services housed within each segment, as described above. Expenses, assets and liabilities primarily related to the corporate headquarters and centralised functions of the Group are presented as unallocated items.

The amounts reported to the chief operational decision-maker ('CODM') are based on the accounting principles used in the preparation of the financial statements. Each segment's performance is evaluated based on segment revenue and segment result.

The segment result is Underlying EBITDA (i.e., earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation before exceptional items). This is the measure reported to the CODM for the purpose of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance. During the year ended 31 March 2023, EBITDA is equal to underlying EBITDA since there are no exceptional items pertaining to EBITDA.

Consequent to the change in reportable segments during the period, comparative information has also been restated in line with the revised segments.

Inter-segment pricing and terms are reviewed and changed by the management to reflect changes in market conditions and changes to such terms are reflected in the period in which the changes occur.

The 'Eliminations' column comprises inter-segment revenues eliminated upon consolidation.

Segment assets and segment liabilities comprise those assets and liabilities directly managed by each segment. Segment assets primarily include receivables, property, plant and equipment, capital work in progress, right-of-use assets, intangibles assets, inventories and cash and cash equivalents. Segment liabilities primarily include operating liabilities. Segment capital expenditure comprises investment in property, plant and equipment, capital work in progress, intangible assets (excluding licences) and capital advances.

The total carrying value of cash-settled share-based compensation liability is nil and nil as of 31 March 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The fair value of options and awards is measured using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The key inputs used in the measurement of the grant date fair valuation of equity-settled plans which are granted during the year are given in the below table:

<table><tr><td></td><td>31 March 2023</td><td>31 March 2022</td></tr><tr><td>Risk free interest rates</td><td>2.12%</td><td>0.08% to 0.16%</td></tr><tr><td>Expected life</td><td>2.00 to 3.00</td><td>2.00 to 3.00</td></tr><tr><td>Volatility</td><td>44.14% to 58.36%</td><td>36.22% to 38.10%</td></tr><tr><td>Dividend yield</td><td>2.97%</td><td>3.69%</td></tr><tr><td>Share price on the date of grant</td><td>1.69</td><td>1.08</td></tr><tr><td>Fair value</td><td>1.23 to 1.27</td><td>0.70 to 0.75</td></tr></table>

The expected life of the stock options is based on the company's expectations and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may actually occur. The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility over a period to the expected life of the options is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome. Further, the expected volatility is based on the weighted average volatility of the comparable benchmark companies.

The details of weighted average remaining contractual life for the share options are as follows:

These defined benefit plans expose the Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, currency risk, interest rate risk and market (investment) risk.

# Notes to consolidated financial statements continued

(All amounts are in US$ millions unless stated otherwise)

# 7. Employee benefits expense continued

The financial and demographic assumptions used to determine defined benefit obligations are as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">As of</td></tr><tr><td>31 March 2023</td><td>31 March 2022</td></tr><tr><td>Discount rate</td><td>7.80% to 15.00%</td><td>8.00% to 14.00%</td></tr><tr><td>Rate of return on plan assets</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td>Rate of salary increase</td><td>4.48% to 7.50%</td><td>3.84% to 7.00%</td></tr><tr><td>Rate of attrition</td><td>5.40% to 14.75%</td><td>5.20% to 13.00%</td></tr><tr><td>Retirement age</td><td>55 to 65 years</td><td>55 to 65 years</td></tr><tr><td>Mortality rate</td><td>CIMA F</td><td>CIMA F</td></tr></table>

The Group regularly assesses these assumptions with the projected long-term plans and prevalent industry standards.

The impact of sensitivity due to changes in the significant actuarial assumptions on the defined benefit obligations is given in the table below:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2" colspan="2"></td><td colspan="3">31 March 2023</td><td colspan="3">31 March 2022</td></tr><tr><td>Retirement benefits</td><td>Severance benefits</td><td>Total</td><td>Retirement benefits</td><td>Severance benefits</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Discount rate</td><td>+1.00%</td><td>(1)</td><td>(0)</td><td>(1)</td><td>(0)</td><td>(0)</td><td>(1)</td></tr><tr><td>-1.00%</td><td>(1)</td><td>0</td><td>(1)</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Salary growth rate</td><td>+1.00%</td><td>(1)</td><td>0</td><td>(1)</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>-1.00%</td><td>(1)</td><td>(0)</td><td>(1)</td><td>(0)</td><td>(1)</td><td>(1)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Withdrawal rate</td><td>+1.00%</td><td>(1)</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>(0)</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>-1.00%</td><td>(1)</td><td>(1)</td><td>(2)</td><td>0</td><td>(1)</td><td>(1)</td></tr></table>

The above sensitivity analysis is determined based on a method that extrapolates the impact on the net defined benefit obligations, because of reasonable possible changes in the significant actuarial assumptions. Further, the above sensitivity analysis is based on a reasonably possible change in a particular underlying actuarial assumption, while assuming all other assumptions to be constant. In practice, it is unlikely to occur as changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.

The table below summarises the maturity profile and duration of the defined benefits plan liability (retirement and severance benefits) on an undiscounted basis:

1 During the year ended 31 March 2023, the Group has recognised new deferred tax assets in Airtel Kenya. Airtel Kenya had carried forward losses and temporary differences on which deferred tax was not previously recognised. Considering Airtel Kenya's profitability trends, that tax losses have recently been utilised and on the basis of forecast future taxable profits, the Group has determined that it is now probable that taxable profits will be available against which the tax losses and temporary differences can be utilised. Consequently, the deferred tax asset recognition criteria are met, leading to the recognition of an additional deferred tax asset of $117m during the year ended 31 March 2023 in Airtel Kenya. Additionally, the Group has also trued up deferred tax assets in Airtel Tanzania and Airtel DRC amounting to $19m and $25m, respectively on deductible temporary differences based on updated probability of future taxable profits in these subsidiaries.

Profit attributable to non-controlling interests include benefit of  $10m and$ 33m during the years ended 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022, respectively, relating to the above exceptional items.

The analysis of deferred tax assets and liabilities is as follows:

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are consolidated jurisdiction wise at component level. The breakdown of deferred tax assets and net deferred tax liabilities is summarised below.

Deferred tax in jurisdictions with net deferred tax assets is comprised of:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">As of</td></tr><tr><td>31 March 2023</td><td>31 March 2022</td></tr><tr><td>Deferred tax assets (net)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>a) Deferred tax asset arising out of</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Carried forward losses</td><td>127</td><td>144</td></tr><tr><td>Fair valuation of financial instruments and exchange differences</td><td>68</td><td>105</td></tr><tr><td>Depreciation/amortisation on PPE/intangible assets</td><td>99</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td>Provision for impairment of trade receivables/advances</td><td>28</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>Deferred tax asset on fair valuation of PPE/intangible</td><td>11</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Employee benefits</td><td>8</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Provision for inventories</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Deferred revenue</td><td>3</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Others</td><td>2</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>b) Deferred tax liability due to</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Depreciation/amortisation on PPE/intangible assets</td><td>(9)</td><td>(103)</td></tr><tr><td>Others</td><td>(3)</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>337</td><td>222</td></tr></table>

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and carry forward tax losses/credits can be utilised. Accordingly, the Group has not recognised deferred tax assets in respect of deductible temporary differences and carry-forward tax losses of  $927m and$ 1,593m as of 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022, respectively, as it is not currently probable that relevant taxable profits will be available in future. The applicable tax rates for the same vary from 20% to 33%, depending on the tax jurisdiction in which the respective Group entity operates.

Unused tax losses and deductible temporary differences for which no deferred tax assets is recognised:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">As of</td></tr><tr><td>31 March 2023</td><td>31 March 2022</td></tr><tr><td>Expiring within 5 years</td><td>222</td><td>389</td></tr><tr><td>Expiring beyond 5 years</td><td>20</td><td>428</td></tr><tr><td>Unlimited</td><td>685</td><td>776</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>927</td><td>1,593</td></tr></table>

The Group has not recognised deferred tax liability with respect to unremitted retained earnings and associated foreign currency translation reserve with respect to certain of its subsidiaries where the Group is in a position to control the timing of the distribution of profits and it is probable that the subsidiaries will not distribute the profits in the foreseeable future. The taxable temporary difference associated with respect to unremitted retained earnings is  $29m and$ 76m as of 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022, respectively. The distribution of the unremitted retained earnings is expected to attract a tax in range of 5% to 20% depending on the tax rate applicable as of 31 March 2023 in the jurisdiction in which the respective Group entity operates. Also, the Group does not recognise deferred tax liability on the unremitted retained earnings of its subsidiaries wherever it believes that it would avail the tax credit for the dividend distribution tax payable by the subsidiaries on its dividend distribution.

# Factors affecting the tax charge in future years

a) The Group's future tax charge and effective tax rate, could be affected by the following factors:  
- Change in income tax rate in any of the jurisdictions in which Group operates  
- Overall profit mix between profit and loss making entities  
- Withholding tax on distributed and undistributed retained earnings of subsidiaries  
- Recognition of deferred tax assets in any of the Group entities  
b) The Group is routinely subjected to audit by tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates. The Group recognises tax provisions based on reasonable estimates for those matters where determination of tax is uncertain but it is considered probable that there will be a future outflow of funds to tax authorities. The amount of these provisions is based on various factors, such as experience of previous tax audits and different interpretations of tax regulations by the tax authority in jurisdictions in which the Group operates; the amount ultimately paid for these uncertain tax cases may differ materially and could, therefore, affect the Group's overall profitability and cash flows in the future.  
c) The tax impact of a transaction disclosed as contingent liability can also be uncertain until a conclusion is reached with the relevant tax authority or through a legal process. Refer to Note 29 for details of the contingencies pertaining to income tax.

1 Mainly consists of reversal of gross carrying value and accumulated depreciation on retirement of intangibles and reclassification from one category of asset to another. Also includes movement from intangible asset under development on capitalisation.  
2 The Group capitalises deferred spectrum license payments, for which the Group is under an obligation for payment till the expiry of the licence period. Consequently, intangible assets are recognised at the present value of such payments with a corresponding liability.

The weighted average remaining amortisation period of the Group's licences as of 31 March 2023 and 2022 is 10.35 years and 9.47 years, respectively.

# Impairment review

As disclosed in Note 6.1, during the year, the Group re-assessed its operating segments which resulted in mobile money becoming a new operating segment of the Group. In line with this change, for the purposes of impairment testing, mobile money was identified as an additional new group of CGUs. The new group of CGUs for impairment testing purposes are Nigeria mobile services, East Africa mobile services, Francophone Africa mobile services and mobile money (previously Nigeria, East Africa and Francophone Africa). Goodwill was reallocated to the four groups of CGUs based on the relative values of each group of CGUs, which resulted in goodwill being reallocated from Nigeria mobile services, East Africa mobile services and Francophone Africa mobile services to the mobile money group of CGUs. Consequently, as of 1 April 2022, goodwill of $1,295m was reallocated to the new group of CGUs, i.e. mobile money.

The carrying amount of goodwill is attributed to the following groups of CGUs:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">As of</td></tr><tr><td>31 March 2023</td><td>31 March 2022</td></tr><tr><td>Nigeria – mobile services</td><td>900</td><td>1,275</td></tr><tr><td>East Africa – mobile services</td><td>927</td><td>1,835</td></tr><tr><td>Franchophone Africa – mobile services</td><td>503</td><td>717</td></tr><tr><td>Mobile money</td><td>1,186</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>3,516</td><td>3,827</td></tr></table>

# 15. Intangible assets continued

The Group tests goodwill for impairment annually on 31 December. The carrying value of goodwill as of 31 December 2022 was  $901m,$ 951m,  $497m and$ 1,200m for Nigeria mobile services, East Africa mobile services and Francophone Africa mobile services and mobile money services, respectively. The recoverable amounts of the above group of CGUs are based on value-in-use, which are determined based on ten-year business plans that have been approved by the Board.

Whilst the Board performed a long-term viability assessment over a three-year period, for the purposes of assessing liquidity (refer to long-term viability statement on pages 98-99), the Group has adopted a ten-year plan for the purpose of impairment testing due to the following reasons:

- The Group operates in emerging markets where the telecommunications and mobile money markets are underpenetrated when compared to developed markets. In these emerging markets, short-term plans (for example, five years) are not indicative of the long-term future prospects and performance of the Group.  
- The life of the Group's regulatory telecom licences and network assets are at an average of ten years, the spectrum renewals happen for a period of ten years or more and in general the replacement of technology happens after a similar duration, and  
- The potential opportunities of the emerging African telecom and mobile money sectors, which is mostly a two-to-three player market with lower smartphone penetration.

Accordingly, the Board approved that this planning horizon reflects the assumptions for medium- to long-term market developments, appropriately covers market dynamics of emerging markets and better reflects the expected performance in the markets in which the Group operates.

While using the ten-year plan, the Group also considers external market data to support the assumptions used in such plans, which is generally available only for the first five years. Considering the degree of availability of external market data beyond year five, the Group has performed sensitivity analysis to assess the impact on impairment of using a five-year plan. The results of this sensitivity analysis demonstrate that the initial five-year plan with appropriate changes, including long-term growth rates applied at the end of this period does not result in any impairment and does not impact the headroom by more than  $6\%$  in any of the group of CGUs as compared to the headroom using the ten-year plan. Further, the Group is confident that projections for years six to ten are reliable and can demonstrate its ability, based on past experience, to forecast cash flows accurately over a longer period. Accordingly, the Board has approved and the Group continues to follow a consistent policy of using an initial forecast period of ten years for the purpose of impairment testing.

In assessing the Group's prospects, the directors considered 5G cellular network potential in the markets in which the Group operates. The Group's first endeavour is to secure spectrum for 5G launch and roll out 5G network in key markets. During the financial year, the Group secured 5G spectrum in Nigeria, Kenya, Zambia and Tanzania and will selectively launch 5G services in these markets. Given the relatively low 4G customer penetration in the countries where it operates, the Group will continue to focus on its strategy to expand its data services and increase data customer penetration by leveraging and expanding its leading 4G network.

The nominal cash flows used in the impairment tests reflect the Group's current assessment of the impact of climate change and associated commitments the Group has made (refer to climate change disclosures on pages 56-61). Based on the analysis conducted so far, the Group is satisfied that the impact of climate change does not lead to an impairment as of 31 December 2022 and is adequately covered as part of the sensitivities disclosed below.

The nominal cash flows beyond the planning period are extrapolated using appropriate long-term terminal growth rates. The long-term terminal growth rates used do not exceed the long-term average growth rates of the respective industry and country in which the entity operates and are consistent with internal/external sources of information.

The inputs used in performing the impairment assessment as of 31 December 2022 were as follows:

<table><tr><td>Assumptions</td><td>Nigeria mobile services</td><td>East Africa mobile services</td><td>Francophone Africa mobile services</td><td>Mobile money</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-tax discount rate</td><td>33.38%</td><td>23.01%</td><td>21.07%</td><td>26.10%</td></tr><tr><td>Capital expenditure (as a percentage of revenue)</td><td>6-23%</td><td>8-20%</td><td>9-26%</td><td>1-5%</td></tr><tr><td>Long term growth rate</td><td>7.64%</td><td>7.30%</td><td>7.35%</td><td>7.47%</td></tr></table>

As of 31 December 2022, the impairment testing did not result in any impairment in the carrying amount of goodwill in any group of CGUs.

The key assumptions in performing the impairment assessment are as follows:

<table><tr><td>Assumptions</td><td>Basis of assumptions</td></tr><tr><td>Discount rate</td><td>Nominal discount rate reflects the market assessment of the risks specific to the group of CGUs and estimated based on the weighted average cost of capital for respective CGUs.</td></tr><tr><td>Capital expenditures</td><td>The cash flow forecasts of capital expenditure are based on experience after considering the capital expenditure required to meet coverage and capacity requirements relating to voice, data and mobile money services.</td></tr><tr><td>Growth rates</td><td>The growth rates into perpetuity used are in line with the nominal long-term average growth rates of the respective industry and country in which the entity operates and are consistent with the internal/external sources of information.</td></tr></table>

As of 31 December 2022, the impairment testing did not result in any impairment in the carrying amount of goodwill in any group of CGUs. The results of the impairment tests using these rates show that the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount by \(1,342m for Nigeria mobile services (54%), \)1,593m for East Africa mobile services (66%), \)1,512m for Francophone Africa mobile services (105%) and $2,688m for mobile money (198%), respectively. The Group, therefore, concluded that no impairment was required to the goodwill held against each group of CGUs.

# Sensitivity in discount rate and capital expenditure

Management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would cause the difference between the carrying value and recoverable amount for any cash-generating unit to be materially different from the recoverable value in the base case. The table below sets out the breakeven pre-tax discount rate for each group of CGUs, which will result in the recoverable amount being equal with the carrying amount for each group of CGUs:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Nigeria mobile services</td><td>East Africa mobile services</td><td>Francophone Africa mobile services</td><td>Mobile money</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-tax discount rate</td><td>46.89%</td><td>32.34%</td><td>33.37%</td><td>55.00%</td></tr></table>

The table below presents the increase in isolation in absolute capital expenditure as a percentage of revenue (across all years of the impairment review) which will result in equating the recoverable amount with the carrying amount for each group of CGUs:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Nigeria mobile services</td><td>East Africa mobile services</td><td>Francophone Africa mobile services</td><td>Mobile money</td></tr><tr><td>Capital expenditure (as a percentage of revenue)</td><td>6.21%</td><td>8.15%</td><td>8.89%</td><td>20.24%</td></tr></table>

No reasonably possible change in the terminal growth rate would cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount.

# Impairment assessment for the year ended 31 March 2022:

The inputs used in performing the impairment assessment at 31 December 2021 were as follows:

As of 31 December 2021, the impairment testing did not result in any impairment in the carrying amount of goodwill in any group of CGUs. The results of the impairment tests using these rates show that the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount by  $5,579m for East Africa (173%) and$ 2,559m for Francophone Africa (160%). For Nigeria, the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount by  $2,842m (104\%)$ , including the cash flows of the PSB licence which was received after the impairment testing date. Excluding such cash flows did not result in any impairment in Nigeria. The Group, therefore, concluded that no impairment was required to the goodwill held against each group of CGUs.

# Sensitivity in discount rate and capital expenditure

Management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would cause the difference between the carrying value and recoverable amount for any cash-generating unit to be materially different from the recoverable value in the base case. The table below sets out the breakeven pre-tax discount rate for each group of CGUs, which will result in the recoverable amount being equal with the carrying amount for each group of CGUs:

The \(550m USD bonds maturing in 2024 contain a negative pledge covenant whereby Bharti Airtel Limited and certain of its significant subsidiaries are not permitted to create any security interest to secure any indebtedness for borrowed money or obligations evidenced by bonds, debentures or notes (among other things, and subject to certain exceptions), without at the same time granting security equally and ratably to the holders of these bonds.

These bonds also contain an event of default clause which gets triggered if Bharti Airtel Limited (intermediate parent entity) ceases to control, directly or indirectly, at least  $51\%$  of the voting power of the voting stock of Bharti Airtel International (Netherlands) B.V. (a subsidiary of the Group) in addition to other events of default which are usual and customary to such bonds.

These bonds are guaranteed by Bharti Airtel Limited (intermediate parent entity), for detail refer to Note 32. Such guarantee is considered an integral part of the bonds and, therefore, accounted for as part of the same unit of account.

# Terms/rights attached to equity shares

The company has following two classes of ordinary shares:

- Ordinary shares having par value of $0.50 per share. Each holder of equity shares is entitled to cast one vote per share and carry a right to dividends.  
- Deferred shares of $0.50 each. These deferred shares are not listed and are intended to be cancelled in due course. No share certificates are to be issued in respect of the deferred shares. These are not freely transferable and would not affect the net assets of the company. The deferred shareholders shall have no right to receive any dividend or other distribution or return whether of capital or income. On a return of capital in a liquidation, the deferred shareholders shall have the right to receive the nominal amount of each deferred share held, but only after the holder of each 'Other' share (i.e., shares other than the deferred shares) in the capital of the company shall have received the amount paid up on each such 'Other' share held and the payment in cash or in specie of £100,000 (or its equivalent in any other currency) on each such 'Other' shares held. The company shall have an irrevocable authority from each holder of the deferred shares at any time to purchase all or any of the deferred shares without obtaining the consent of the deferred shareholders in consideration of the payment of an amount not exceeding one US$ cent in respect of all of the deferred shares then being purchased.

# 27. Other equity

# a. Retained earnings

Retained earnings represent the amount of accumulated earnings of the company and gains/(losses) on common control transactions.

The company's distributable reserves are equal to the balance of its retained earnings of \(689m (as presented on page 237 in the company only financial statements). The majority of the distributable reserves are held in investment and operating subsidiaries. Management continuously monitors the level of distributable reserves in each company in the Group, ensuring adequate reserves are available for upcoming dividend payments and that the company has access to these reserves.

# b. Share premium

The aggregate difference between the par value of shares and the subscription amount is recognised as share premium.

There are uncertainties in the legal, regulatory and tax environments in the countries in which the Group operates and there is a risk of demands, which may be raised based on current or past business operations. Such demands have in the past been challenged and contested on merits with the relevant authorities and appropriate settlements agreed.

The reduction of \(13m in contingent liabilities during the year ended 31 March 2023 is primarily due to a change in the likelihood of outflow of resources from possible to remote related to the 2016 VAT matter on the sale of towers.

The company and its subsidiaries are currently and may become, from time to time, involved in a number of legal proceedings, including inquiries from, or discussions with, governmental authorities that are incidental to their operations. As of 31 March 2023, the Group's key contingent liabilities include the following:

# 1. Value-added tax (VAT)

# VAT Audit 2016

In July 2016, one of the subsidiaries in the mobile services business made a payment to another subsidiary engaged in passive infrastructure services for all invoices raised since 2013 for rendering tower services. The subsidiary claimed the input VAT charged on these invoices.

During the desktop VAT audit conducted by the tax authorities for 2016, the above-mentioned VAT credit was denied alleging that the VAT credit was time-barred. Based on the VAT rules, the mobile services subsidiary is of the view that the time limitation for claiming input VAT starts from the year in which payment is made against the invoice. Since the payment was made in 2016, the time limit for claiming input credit (by 31 December of following year) had not lapsed.

In October 2016, the mobile services subsidiary received a notice of recovery and proceeded to make the  $10\%$  deposit in order to initiate litigation. The subsidiary submitted a comprehensive letter to the authorities in October 2017, for which a response is awaited from the tax authorities. An amount of $8m is included within contingent liabilities in respect of this matter. No provision has been created against this claim.

Claims under legal and regulatory cases, including arbitration matters

2. One of the subsidiaries of the Group is involved in a dispute with one of its vendors, with respect to invoices for services provided to a subsidiary under a service contract. The original order under the contract was issued by the subsidiary for a total amount of Central African franc (CFA) 473,800,000 (approx.  $1m). In 2014, the vendor-initiated arbitration proceedings claiming a sum of approximately CFA 1.9bn (approx.$ 3m). In mid-May 2019, the lower courts imposed a penalty of CFA 35bn (approx. $59m), based on which certain banks of the subsidiary were summoned to release the funds. The subsidiary immediately lodged an appeal in the Supreme Court for a stay of execution which was granted. Subsequently, the vendor filed an appeal before the Common Court of Justice and Arbitration (CCJA). Quite unexpectedly, in April 2020, the CCJA lifted the Supreme Court stay of execution. In May 2021, the Commercial Division of the High Court maintained new seizures carried out by the vendor. The subsidiary appealed and the Court of Appeal determination on the seizures is pending as of April 2022. In March 2022 the CCJA interpreted its judgment of March 2019 to indicate that the daily penalty could not be maintained after its ruling dated 18 November 2018.

Separately, in December 2020 the subsidiary initiated criminal proceedings against the vendor for fraud and deceitful conduct. In February 2021, the investigating judge issued an order to cease the investigation which was appealed by the subsidiary. In March 2022, the Court Appeal quashed the investigative judge order and allowed the investigation into the vendor to resume. Testimony in the criminal investigation case happened on 26 April 2022 in front of the Criminal Court of Appeal where the honorable judge has further re-examined the facts from the representatives of the subsidiary against this case. The court will provide a further update on the upcoming proceedings in due course.

As per the law no civil action can be initiated against the subsidiary while criminal proceedings are ongoing. On 30 November 2022 subsidiary was notified that the plaintiff has appealed in the court of cassation against the stay of execution dated 30 May 2022. Subsidiary has filed its response on 26 January 2023. The Group still awaits the Supreme Court ruling on the merits of the case, and until that time has disclosed this matter as a contingent liability for $59m (included in the closing contingent liability). No provision has been made against this claim.

3. One of the subsidiaries of the Group is involved in a dispute with one of its distributors, with respect to alleged unpaid commissions, bonuses and benefits, totalling approximately  $11m, over a period of around 11 years of its business relationship with the subsidiary. In March 2012, the distributor filed a claim against the subsidiary in the High Court. On 4 October 2016, the High Court ruled against the subsidiary and ordered to pay the claimed amount of approximately$ 11m to the distributor. On 5 October 2016, the subsidiary filed an appeal in the Court of Appeal against the order of the High Court, which on 24 July 2020 was ruled against the subsidiary. On 7 August 2020, the subsidiary filed an appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal, in the Supreme Court. Record of appeal has been transmitted to the Supreme Court and briefs of argument are currently being prepared.

Despite the strength of the subsidiary's line of defence, as both the High Court and Court of Appeal have ruled against the subsidiary, it is appropriate to disclose this matter as contingent liability for $11m, pending the decision of the Supreme Court. No provision has been made against this claim.

In addition to the individual matters disclosed above, in the ordinary course of business, the Group is a defendant or co-defendant in various litigations and claims which are immaterial individually.

# Guarantees:

Guarantees outstanding as of 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022 amounting to  $9m and$ 8m, respectively, have been issued by banks and financial institutions on behalf of the Group. These guarantees include certain financial bank guarantees which have been given for sub judice matters and the amounts with respect to these have been disclosed under capital commitments, contingencies and liabilities, as applicable, in compliance with the applicable accounting standards.

# (ii) Commitments

# Capital commitments

The Group has contractual commitments towards capital expenditure (net of related advances paid) of  $313m and$ 295m as of 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022, respectively.

# i. Plant and equipment

The Group leases passive infrastructure for providing telecommunications services under composite contracts which include lease of passive infrastructure and land on which the passive infrastructure is built as well as maintenance, security, provision of energy and other services. These leases typically run for a period of 3-15 years. Some leases include an option to renew the lease mainly for an additional period of 3-10 years after the end of initial contract term based on renegotiation of lease rentals. Considering this, the Group has only considered the original lease period for lease term determination. A portion of certain lease payments change on account of changes in consumer price indices (CPI). Such payment terms are common in lease agreements in the countries where the Group operates. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions.

# ii. Other leases

The Group's other leases comprise lease of offices, shops, showrooms, guest houses, warehouses, data centers, vehicles and Indefeasible right of use (IRU).

# (b) As a lessor

The Group's lease arrangements as a lessor mainly pertain to passive infrastructure (plant and equipment). Lease income from such arrangements is presented as revenue in the statement of comprehensive income.

# 32. Financial risk management

The Group has liabilities in the form of borrowings, guarantees, trade and other payables as well as receivables in the form of loans, cash, deposits, trade and other receivables. These arise as a part of the business activities and operations of the Group.

The business activities of the Group expose it to a variety of financial risks, namely market risks (that is, foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. Further, the Group uses certain derivative financial instruments to mitigate some of these risk exposures. The Group's senior management oversees the management of these risks. The senior professionals working to manage the financial risks and the appropriate financial risk governance framework for the Group are accountable to the Board of directors and the Audit and Risk Committee. The Group's Finance Committee is primarily responsible for matters, including framing of policies and execution procedures as well as laying down the risk framework mechanisms for the treasury function that will help the company to achieve its strategic financial goals, balancing opportunity, prudence and initiative with risk control measures. This provides assurance to the Group that the Group's financial risk-taking activities are governed by appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with Group policies and Group risk appetite. All derivative activities for risk management purposes are carried out by specialist teams that have the appropriate skills, experience and supervision. It is the Group's policy that no trading in derivatives for speculative purposes shall be undertaken.

# 32. Financial risk management continued

Details of key risks applicable to the Group are summarised below:

# Market risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market prices comprise three types of risk – currency rate risk, interest rate risk and other price risks, such as equity risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings, deposits, investments, and derivative financial instruments.

The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Group may use derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts, options, currency swaps and interest rate swaps and options to manage its exposures to foreign exchange fluctuations and interest rates.

# Foreign exchange risk

Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group has foreign currency loans and foreign currency trade payables and receivables and is, therefore, exposed to foreign exchange risk. Further, the Group derives revenue and incurs costs in local currencies where it operates, but it also incurs costs in foreign currencies, mainly from buying equipment and services from manufacturers and technology service providers. That means adverse movements in exchange rates between the currencies in the Group's OpCos and the US dollar could have a negative effect on Group's liquidity and financial condition. In some markets, the Group faces instances of limited supply of foreign currency within the local monetary system. This not only constrains Group's ability to fully benefit at Group level from strong cash generation by those OpCos but also impacts its ability to make timely foreign currency payments to our international suppliers.

The Group may use risk management products such as foreign exchange options, currency swaps or forward contracts towards hedging risk resulting from changes and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rate. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, may have varying maturities depending upon the primary host contract requirement and risk management strategy of the Group. The Group manages its foreign currency risk by hedging its foreign currency exposure as per business needs and as approved by Board in accordance with established risk management policy. The Group also continues to mitigate foreign exchange risk by minimising cash held in local currency in its various OpCos where possible through such risk management products.

Given the severity of this risk, specifically in some of Group's OpCos, Group management continuously monitors the potential impact of this risk of exchange rate fluctuations based on the following methodology:

a) Comparing the average devaluation of each currency in the markets in which the Group operates against US dollar on 3-year and 5-year historic basis and onshore forward exchange rates over a 1-year period.  
b) If either of the above devaluations is higher than  $5\%$  per annum, management selects the highest of these exchange rates.  
c) Management then uses this exchange rate to monitor the potential impact of using such rate on the Group's income statement so that the Group can actively monitor and assess the impact on the Group's financials due to exchange rate fluctuations.

Based on the above-mentioned methodology, the weighted average yearly potential devaluation of the basket of currencies in which the Group is exposed is estimated to be in the range of  $7\%$  to  $8\%$  in the subsidiaries meeting the above criteria.

With respect to currency devaluation sensitivity, on a 12-month basis, a  $1\%$  currency devaluation across all currencies in our OpCos would have a negative impact of  $51m on revenues,$ 31m on EBITDA and $23m on finance costs (excluding derivatives). Our largest exposure is to the Nigerian naira, for which a  $1\%$  devaluation would have a negative impact of  $22m on revenues,$ 12m on EBITDA and $7m on finance costs (excluding derivatives).

This does not represent any guidance and is being used solely to illustrate the potential impact of further currency devaluation on the Group for the purpose of exchange rate risk management. The accounting under IFRS is based on exchange rates in line with the requirements of IAS 21 'The Effect of Changes in Foreign Exchange' and does not factor in the above-mentioned devaluation.

Based on above-mentioned specific methodology, for the identified OpCos, management evaluates specific mitigation actions based on available mechanisms in each of the geographies. For further details on such mitigation action refer to the risk section of the Annual Report

The following table demonstrates the sensitivity in the US$ account balances to the functional currency of the respective entities as of 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022, with all other variables held constant. The impact on the Group's profit before tax is due to changes in the amount of monetary assets and liabilities due to the impact of change in foreign exchange rates, including foreign currency derivatives. The impact on the Group's equity is due to a change in the fair value of intra-group monetary items that form part of the net investment in foreign operation and other foreign currency monetary items designated as a hedge of the net investment in foreign operations or our cash flow hedges.

# - Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group's exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group's interest-bearing debt obligations with floating interest rates. Further, the Group engages in financing activities which are dependent on market rates and any changes in the interest rates environment may impact future rates of borrowing. The Group monitors the interest rate movement and manages the interest rate risk based on its risk management policies, which inter alia include entering into interest swaps contracts as considered appropriate and whenever necessary. The Group also maintains a portfolio mix of floating and fixed rate debt. As of 31 March 2023 after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps, approx.  $48\%$  of the Group's borrowings are at a fixed rate of interest (31 March 2022:  $70\%$ ).

The Group had applied fair value hedge accounting in the past which was discontinued in the year ended 31 March 2020. In accordance with the Group's accounting policy, the adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item is being amortised to profit or loss over the period to remaining maturity of the hedged item, i.e., borrowings. The unamortised portion of such fair value hedge adjustments as on 31 March 2023 is deferred gain of $5m (31 March 2022: deferred gain of $16m).

# Interest rate sensitivity of borrowings

With all other variables held constant, the following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on floating rate portion of loans and borrowings after considering the impact of interest rate swaps, wherever applicable, based on the outstanding amount of such borrowings as of 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022.

# Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk that a counter party will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities, primarily from trade receivables but also from cash, other banks balances, derivative financial instruments and other financial receivables.

# Trade receivables

Trade receivables are typically non-interest bearing unsecured and derived from sales made to a large number of independent customers. As the customer base is widely distributed both economically and geographically, there is no concentration of credit risk.

As independent credit ratings of customers is not available. The Group reviews the creditworthiness of its customers based on their financial position, past experience, ageing and other factors.

Credit risk related to trade receivables is managed/mitigated by each business unit in accordance with the policies and procedures established by the Group, by setting appropriate payment terms and credit period, and by setting and monitoring internal limits on exposure to individual customers. The credit period provided by the Group to its customers generally ranges from 14-30 days.

The Group uses an age-based provision policy to measure the expected credit loss of trade receivables, which comprise a very large numbers of small balances. Refer to Note 19 for details on the impairment of trade receivables.

Based on the industry practices and the business environment in which the Group operates, management considers trade receivables are credit impaired if the payments are more than 270 days past due in case of interconnect customers and 90 days past due in other cases since probability of default in such cases is considered to be  $100\%$  except amounts due from related parties. In determining the amount of impairment, management considers the collateral against such receivables and any amount payable to such customers.

The following table details the risk profile of gross trade receivables based on the Group's provision policy:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td rowspan="2">Not past due</td><td colspan="5">Past due</td><td rowspan="2">Total</td></tr><tr><td>Less than 30 days</td><td>31 to 60 days</td><td>61 to 90 days</td><td>91 to 270 days</td><td>Above 270 days</td></tr><tr><td>Trade receivables as of 31 March 2023</td><td>13</td><td>25</td><td>14</td><td>40</td><td>51</td><td>186</td><td>329</td></tr><tr><td>Trade receivables as of 31 March 2022</td><td>15</td><td>28</td><td>8</td><td>4</td><td>48</td><td>200</td><td>303</td></tr></table>

The gross carrying amount of the trade receivable is written off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when the Group determines that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amount due. Where the trade receivable has been written off, the Group continues to engage in enforcement activity to attempt to recover the receivable due. Where recoveries are made, these are recognised in profit and loss.

# Other financial instruments and cash deposits

The Group's treasury, in accordance with the Board approved policy, maintains its cash and cash equivalents and deposits and enters into derivative financial instruments – with banks, financial and other institutions, having a good reputation and past track record which are considered to carry a low credit risk. Similarly, counterparties of the Group's other receivables carry either negligible or very low credit risk. Further, the Group reviews the creditworthiness of the counter-parties (on the basis of its ratings, credit spreads and financial strength) of all the above assets on an ongoing basis, and if required, takes necessary mitigation measures.

# - Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may not be able to meet its present and future obligations as and when due, without incurring unacceptable losses. The Group's liquidity risk management objective is to, at all times, maintain adequate levels of liquidity to meet its requirements. The Group closely monitors its liquidity position, expected cash flows and deploys a robust cash management and planning exercise. It maintains adequate sources of financing, including term loans, short-term loans and overdraft from both domestic and international banks at an optimised cost. It has also implemented all necessary steps to enjoy strong access to international capital markets if and when required. For details on borrowings and going concern, refer to Notes 22 and 2.2, respectively.

# Capital management

Capital includes equity attributable to the equity holders of the company. The primary objective of the Group's capital management is to ensure that it maintains an efficient capital structure and healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.

The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions or its business requirements. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.

No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022.

The Group monitors capital using a leverage ratio, which is net debt divided by underlying EBITDA. Net debt is calculated as total of borrowings and lease liabilities less cash and cash equivalents, term deposits with banks, processing costs related to borrowings and fair value hedge adjustments. Also refer to alternative performance measures on pages 240-245.

# 33. Fair Value of financial assets and liabilities continued

The following methods/assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:

- The carrying value of bank deposits, trade receivables, trade payables, short-term borrowings, other current financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair value mainly due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.  
- Fair value of quoted financial instruments is based on quoted market price at the reporting date.  
The fair value of non-current financial assets, long-term borrowings and other financial liabilities is estimated by discounting future cash flows using current rates applicable to instruments with similar terms, currency, credit risk and remaining maturities.  
- The fair values of derivatives are estimated by using pricing models, wherein the inputs to those models are based on readily observable market parameters. The valuation models used by the Group reflect the contractual terms of the derivatives (including the period to maturity), and market-based parameters such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, volatility etc. These models do not contain a high level of subjectivity as the valuation techniques used do not require significant judgement and inputs thereto are readily observable.  
- The fair value of the put option liability to buy back the stake held by non-controlling interest in AMC B.V. is measured at the present value of the redemption amount (i.e., expected cash outflows). Since the liability will be based on fair value of the equity shares of AMC B.V. (subject to a cap) at the end of 48 months, the expected cash flows are estimated by determining the projected equity valuation of the AMC B.V. at the end of 48 months and applying a cap thereon.

During the years ended 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, and no transfer into or out of Level 3 fair value measurements.

The following table describes the key inputs used in the valuation (basis discounted cash flow technique) of the Level 2 financial assets/liabilities as of 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022:

<table><tr><td>Financial assets/liabilities</td><td>Inputs used</td></tr><tr><td>– Currency swaps, forward and option contracts, and other bank balances</td><td>Forward foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates</td></tr><tr><td>– Interest rate swaps</td><td>Prevailing/forward interest rates in market, interest rates</td></tr><tr><td>– Embedded derivatives</td><td>Prevailing interest rates in market, inflation rates</td></tr><tr><td>– Other financial assets/fixed rate borrowings/other financial liabilities</td><td>Prevailing interest rates in market, future payouts, interest rates</td></tr></table>

# Notes to company only financial statements

(All amounts are in US$ millions unless stated otherwise)

# 1. Summary of significant accounting policies

# Basis of preparation

The company only financial statements are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. The company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under FRS 100 'Application of Financial Reporting Requirements' issued by the FRC. Accordingly, the company has prepared financial statements as per FRS 101 'Reduced Disclosure Framework.

Airtel Africa plc is the parent of the smallest group for which consolidated financial statements are prepared and of which the company is a member. The largest group to consolidate the results of the company is Bharti Airtel Limited, which is registered in India. The Bharti Airtel Limited Group financial statements are publically available and can be obtained at www.airtel.in.

All the amounts included in the Company only financial statements are reported in United States dollars (the functional currency of the company), with all values rounded to the nearest thousand (USD thousand) except when otherwise indicated. Further, amounts which are less than half a thousand are appearing as '0'.

As permitted by Section 408(3) of the Companies Act 2006, no profit and loss account of the company is presented.

As permitted by FRS 101, the company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available in relation to:

The requirements of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: disclosures.  
The requirements of IAS 7 Statement of cash flows.  
The statement of compliance with adopted IFRSs.  
- The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs.  
- The requirements in IAS 24 'Related party disclosure' to disclose related-party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group.

Disclosures in respect of capital management; and  
- Paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2, 'Share-based payment' (details of the number and weighted-average exercise prices of share options).

Where required, equivalent disclosures are given in the consolidated financial statements. The company financial statements have been prepared on a going concern and historical cost basis. The principal accounting policies adopted are the same as those set out in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements except the following additional policies which are relevant to the company only financial statements:

- Investment in subsidiary undertakings are accounted for at cost.  
- Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders' rights to receive payment have been established (provided that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the company and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably).

# 2. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty

In the application of the company's accounting policies, which are described in Note 1, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. There are no critical accounting judgments or key sources of estimation uncertainty that would have a significant effect on the amount recognised in the company financial statements.

# Alternative performance measures (APMs)

# Introduction

In the reporting of financial information, the directors have adopted various APMs. These measures are not defined by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and therefore may not be directly comparable with other companies APMs, including those in the Group's industry.

APMs should be considered in addition to, and are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, IFRS measurements.

# Purpose

The directors believe that these APMs assist in providing additional useful information on the underlying trends, performance and position of the Group.

APMs are also used to enhance the comparability of information between reporting periods and geographical units (such as like-for-like sales), by adjusting for non-recurring or uncontrollable factors which affect IFRS measures, to aid users in understanding the Group's performance. Consequently, APMs are used by the directors and management for performance analysis, planning, reporting and incentive-setting purposes.

The directors believe the following metrics to be the APMs used by the Group to help evaluate growth trends, establish budgets and assess operational performance and efficiencies. These measures provide an enhanced understanding of the Group's results and related trends, therefore increasing transparency and clarity into the core results of the business.

The following metrics are useful in evaluating the Group's operating performance:

<table><tr><td>APM</td><td>Closest equivalent IFRS measure</td><td>Adjustments to reconcile to IFRS measure</td><td>Table reference1</td><td>Definition and purpose</td></tr><tr><td>Underlying EBITDA and margin</td><td>Operating profit</td><td>Depreciation and amortisationExceptional items</td><td>Table A</td><td>The Group defines underlying EBITDA as operating profit/(loss) for the period before depreciation and amortisation and adjusted for exceptional items.The Group defines underlying EBITDA margin as underlying EBITDA divided by revenue.Underlying EBITDA and margin are measures used by the directors to assess the trading performance of the business and are therefore the measure of segment profit that the Group presents under IFRS. Underlying EBITDA and margin are also presented on a consolidated basis because the directors believe it is important to consider profitability on a basis consistent with that of the Group's operating segments. When presented on a consolidated basis, underlying EBITDA and margin are APMs.Depreciation and amortisation is a non-cash item which fluctuates depending on the timing of capital investment and useful economic life. Directors believe that a measure which removes this volatility improves comparability of the Group's results period on period and hence is adjusted to arrive at underlying EBITDA and margin.Exceptionial items are additional specific items that because of their size, nature or incidence in the results, are considered to hinder comparison of the Group's performance on a period-to-period basis and could distort the understanding of our performance for the period and the comparability between periods and hence are adjusted to arrive at underlying EBITDA and margin.</td></tr><tr><td>Underlying profit/(loss) before tax</td><td>Profit/(loss) before tax</td><td>Exceptional items</td><td>Table B</td><td>The Group defines underlying profit/(loss) before tax as profit/(loss) before tax adjusted for exceptional items.The directors view underlying profit/(loss) before tax to be a meaningful measure to analyse the Group's profitability.Exceptionial items are additional specific items that because of their size, nature or incidence in the results, are considered to hinder comparison of the Group's performance on a period-to-period basis and could distort the understanding of our performance for the period and the comparability between periods and hence are adjusted to arrive at underlying profit/(loss) before tax.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4">Effective tax rate</td><td rowspan="4">Reported tax rate</td><td rowspan="4">·Exceptional items

The Group defines underlying EBIT as operating profit/(loss) for the period adjusted for exceptional items. 
Exceptional items are additional specific items that because of their size, nature or incidence in the results, are considered to hinder comparison of the Group&#x27;s performance on a period-to-period basis and could distort the understanding of our performance for the period and the comparability between periods and hence are adjusted to arrive at underlying EBIT. 
Capital employed is defined as sum of equity attributable to owners of the company (grossed up for put option provided to minority shareholders to provide them liquidity as part of the sale agreements executed with them during year ended 31 March 2022), non-controlling interests and net debt. 
Average capital employed is average of capital employed at the closing and beginning of the relevant period. 
For quarterly computations, ROCE is calculated by dividing underlying EBIT for the preceding 12 months by the average capital employed (being the average of the capital employed averages for the preceding four quarters).</td></tr></table>

1 Refer to 'Reconciliation between GAAP and Alternative Performance Measures' for respective table.

Some of the Group's IFRS measures and APMs are translated at constant currency exchange rates to measure the organic performance of the Group. In determining the percentage change in constant currency terms, both current and previous financial reporting period's results have been converted using exchange rates prevailing as on 31 March 2022. Reported currency percentage change is derived on the basis of the average actual periodic exchange rates for that financial period. Variances between constant currency and reported currency percentages are due to exchange rate movements between the previous financial reporting period and the current period. The constant currency numbers only reflect the retranslation of reported numbers into exchange rates as at 31 March 2022 and are not intended to represent the wider impact that currency changes has on the business.

# Changes to APMs

Underlying revenue: the underlying revenue has not been defined as an APM due to the absence of any exceptional items during the period.  
- Return on capital employed (ROCE): the Group has revised the computation of ROCE by grossing up the 'equity attributable to owners of the company' for put option provided to minority shareholders based on the fact that this liability was created through reserves and the Group believes that it should not impact the computation of return on capital employed. The previous period ROCE has also been restated for this change.

# Warning to shareholders ('boiler room' scams)

In recent years, many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited calls or correspondence concerning investment matters. These callers typically make claims of highly profitable opportunities in UK investments which turn out to be worthless or simply do not exist. These approaches are usually made by unauthorised companies and individuals and are commonly known as 'boiler room' scams. Airtel Africa plc shareholders are advised to be extremely wary of such approaches and advised to only deal with firms authorised by FCA. See the FCA website at fca.org.uk/scamsmart for more detailed information about this or similar activities.

# Auditor's ESEF Assurance statement

Independent auditor's reasonable assurance report on the compliance of Airtel Africa plc's European Single Electronic Format (ESEF) prepared Annual Financial Report with the European Single Electronic Format Regulatory Technical Standard ('ESEF RTS') as required by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule (DTR) 4.1.14R

# To the Members of Airtel Africa plc

Report on compliance with the requirements for iXBRL mark up ('tagging') of consolidated financial statements included in the ESEF-prepared Annual Financial Report

We have undertaken a reasonable assurance engagement on the iXBRL mark up of consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2023 of Airtel Africa plc (the "company") included in the ESEF-prepared Annual Financial Report prepared by the company.

# Opinion

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2023 of the company included in the ESEF-prepared Annual Financial Report, are marked up, in all material respects, in compliance with the ESEF RTS.

The directors' responsibility for the ESEF-prepared Annual Financial Report prepared in compliance with the ESEF RTS

The directors are responsible for preparing the ESEF-prepared Annual Financial Report. This responsibility includes:

- the selection and application of appropriate iXBRL tags using judgement where necessary;  
ensuring consistency between digitised information and the consolidated financial statements presented in human-readable format; and  
- the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the application of the ESEF RTS.

# Our independence and quality control

We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of Financial Reporting Council's (the 'FRC's') Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

We apply International Standard on Quality Control 1 and, accordingly, maintain a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

# Our responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on whether the electronic mark up of consolidated financial statements complies in all material respects with the ESEF RTS based on the evidence we have obtained. We conducted our reasonable assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (UK) 3000, Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information ('ISAE (UK) 3000') issued by the FRC.

A reasonable assurance engagement in accordance with ISAE (UK) 3000 involves performing procedures to obtain reasonable assurance about the compliance of the mark up of the consolidated financial statements with the ESEF RTS. The nature, timing and extent of procedures selected depend on the practitioner's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material departures from the requirements set out in the ESEF RTS, whether due to fraud or error. Our reasonable assurance engagement consisted primarily of:

- obtaining an understanding of the ESEF RTS mark up process, including internal control over the mark up process relevant to the engagement;  
reconciling the marked up data with the audited consolidated financial statements of the company dated 31 March 2023;  
- evaluating the appropriateness of the company's mark up of the consolidated financial statements using the XBRL mark-up language;  
- evaluating the appropriateness of the company's use of iXBRL elements selected from a permitted taxonomy and the creation of extension elements where no suitable element in the permitted taxonomy has been identified; and  
- evaluating the use of anchoring in relation to the extension elements.

In this report we do not express an audit opinion, review conclusion or any other assurance conclusion on the consolidated financial statements. Our audit opinion relating to the consolidated financial statements of the company for the year ended 31 March 2023 is set out in our Independent Auditor's Report dated 10 May 2023.

# Use of our report

Our report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with ISAE (UK) 3000. Our work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company those matters we are required to state to them in this report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's members as a body for our work, this report, or for the conclusions we have formed.
