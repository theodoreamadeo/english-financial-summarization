# CASE STUDY METCASH BECOMES FIRST GROcery RETAILER TO SUPPORT THE NATIONAL PLASTICS RECYCLING SCHEME (NPRS)

In February 2024, Metcash announced it would support the NPRS to help close the loop on soft plastic waste.

The NPRS is an industry-led scheme created to fill the gaps in Australia's current soft plastic recycling capability and to establish a long-term circular economy for household soft plastics. Metcash was the first grocery retailer to officially sign on to support the NPRS by providing packaging data from its private label grocery products, as well as financial support and insights to shape and further promote the program. To-date the NPRS has focused on trialling kerbside collections of soft plastic household waste for recycling into food-grade plastic packaging as part of a new, onshore circular system.

Supporting the NPRS aligns with Metcash's priorities of increasing the use of sustainable packaging in our products and reducing packaging waste in our supply chain. In addition to existing initiatives to reduce waste to landfill in our distribution centres and independent retail network, we will accelerate new packaging solutions and further help our shoppers recycle their soft plastic household waste as conveniently as possible.

Welcome to the Metcash Annual Report for the 2024 financial year. I am pleased to report that the Company has again delivered strong results underpinned by the success of our strategy and the disciplined execution of key initiatives.

Operationally, all pillars performed well, in line with their strategic positioning, demonstrating resilience in softer market conditions. In Food, strong earnings growth was delivered in the most value-conscious shopping environment in recent memory, providing further evidence of its shift to a sustainable and resilient business model. Our Liquor pillar continued to outperform the market, win share and deliver strong earnings growth. In Hardware, the business endured a further weakening in external conditions but given our strong market position remains ideally positioned for an improvement in activity levels.

# GROUP FINANCIALS

Total Group revenue increased  $0.7\%$  to  $\$ 18.2bn$  (or  $\$ 15.9bn$  excluding charge- through sales), while Group EBIT declined  $0.9\%$  to  $\$ 496.3m$ , with growth in Food and Liquor earnings being offset by lower earnings in Hardware and increased corporate costs.

Underlying profit after tax was  $8.2\%$  lower at \ $282.3m, largely reflecting the more challenging conditions in Hardware. Reported profit after tax was down \(0.7\%$  to \\)257.2m.

The Company's operating cash flow was a standout for the year, increasing 29.5% to $483m. This resulted in a cash realisation ratio of 102%, and a three-year average of ~90%.

Total dividends for the year were 19.5 cents per share fully franked, in line with the target payout ratio of  $\sim 70\%$  of underlying profit after tax. This reflects the Company's strong cash performance balanced with its desire to invest in future growth opportunities.

Doug Jones will discuss the financial results and operating performance in more detail in his Group CEO's report.

# STRATEGY

Our strategy, which for many years has focused on strengthening the competitive position of our retail networks, has resulted in a diversified business portfolio and platform that continues to deliver strong results. This can be seen in the growth in Group earnings which has increased  $56\%$  since FY20, with a compound annual growth rate of  $12\%$ .

In February, we announced major strategic acquisitions in the Food and Hardware pillars. The acquisition of Superior Foods was completed in June and will further strengthen our current Food business. It also opens up new growth opportunities in the attractive and adjacent foodservices market. The Hardware acquisitions of Alpine Truss and Bianco Construction Supplies accelerate our Whole of House strategy and further strengthen the business' market position.

At our Investor Day held last March, we indicated that our strategic focus is on replicating successful growth strategies across the Metcash Group. We have the platform and capabilities to deliver this strategy and grow not only our current businesses, but also any future businesses we may acquire.

# LEADERSHIP CHANGES

As I noted last year, Deepa Sita was appointed Group CFO replacing Alistair Bell, who had earlier advised of his intention to retire from the role. Deepa joined us in January this year and has also assumed responsibility for the Group Strategy function. I would like to thank Alistair who kindly agreed to stay on longer than planned to facilitate Deepa's transition into the role.

Unfortunately, Chris Baddock needed to retire from the CEO Liquor role in October last year for health reasons. John Barakat, the Liquor pillar's General Manager of Merchandise and Operations, stepped up to lead the team well until the completion of an extensive search for a replacement and the subsequent commencement of Kylie Wallbridge as the new CEO of Liquor in March. Kylie has extensive Australian and international experience in the liquor industry.

We also welcomed Richard Murray as our new CEO of Total Tools Holdings at the end of January this year following an earlier announcement that Paul Dumbrell had decided to step down after more than five years in the position. Richard is a highly experienced and respected executive with a proven track record in the Australian retail sector.

In May, we announced that Annette Welsh will be transitioning from her current CEO role in IHG to a corporate strategy and governance role. Annette advised that after serving 15 years in senior management roles in IHG, including the last five as CEO, it was an appropriate time for her to step down and hand over to a successor. Geoff Harris, IHG's current General Manager of Merchandise, will be interim CEO until the search process for Annette's replacement is completed.

# REMUNERATION

This year changes were made to our remuneration framework to bring it more in line with market practice. This included increasing the deferred portion of the Short-Term Incentive (STI) from  $33\%$  to  $40\%$  for the Group CEO, and from  $25\%$  to  $33\%$  for the Group CFO. This portion will increase to  $50\%$  for the Group CEO and  $40\%$  for the Group CFO in FY25 and  $50\%$  in FY26.

We also refined the Balanced Scorecards for executives, with all executives now sharing Group financial and strategic objectives (weighted  $70\%$ ) to ensure an increased collective focus and accountability on Group objectives.

An 'adjusted EBIT' was introduced for the FY24 performance measure for STI and the ROFE LTI hurdle. This results in Project Horizon and Mega Distribution Centre significant item costs being included in the awards calculation to reflect the importance of successfully delivering these projects.

Remuneration outcomes continuing executives for the year included STI awards ranging from  $14.6\%$  to  $38.1\%$  of the maximum opportunity. While in relation to the LTI incentive, the FY22 grant was tested at the conclusion of three years and vested at  $76.7\%$ .

Fixed remuneration was increased for the CEO of IHG, and the former CEO of the Liquor pillar, by  $8.3\%$  and  $4.2\%$  respectively. The adjustments were made to reflect each executive's deep level of role experience relative to the market benchmarks.

Adjustments were also made to Non-Executive Director fees, which increased to  $167,595. Chair fees for the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee and the People, Culture and Nomination Committee increased to$ 46,350, with member fees for these committees increasing to $22,660. There will be no increases to Director fees in FY25.

The Board intends to conduct another review of the Company's remuneration framework in FY25 to ensure the executive remuneration mix and performance metrics align with the Company's longer-term strategic objectives.

Further details on the Company's remuneration framework and outcomes can be found in the Remuneration Report commencing on page 51.

# Metcash's business remains sound. Our financial position is strong, our strategy continues to deliver and the addition of new channels through our recent acquisitions will help us to continue progressing our growth plans.

# ENVIRONMENT, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (ESG)

I am pleased to report that we have continued to make good progress with our ESG plans, which cover the key areas of People, Planet and Community.

Our overall ESG performance was placed in the 89th percentile of our international sector in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, which is a further improvement on the 87th percentile achieved in the prior year's assessment.

We achieved our reduction target for the year for Scope 1 and 2 emissions and remain on track for achieving an  $80\%$  reduction in these emissions between 2020 and 2030. We also made good progress in better understanding our Scope 3 emissions, which is a significant area of focus and forms part of our readiness work associated with the new Sustainability Reporting Standard that we anticipate will become effective for Metcash in FY26.

We also achieved our waste diversion target for the year and are on track to achieve our longer-term target of diverting  $80\%$  of waste from landfill by 2028.

Ensuring the safety of our people remains the highest of priorities, and it was good to see the significant safety initiatives made in the year reflected in a  $21\%$  improvement in our key performance measure of Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR).

We continued to focus on maintaining our excellent record of paying equitably across the Metcash Group. Our gender pay gap was maintained at  $\sim 1\%$  and we were ranked 45th globally in the 2024 Equileap Top 100 companies for gender equality list.

Workplace engagement and culture continues to be a key focus for us, and we achieved a further improvement this year with an engagement survey score of  $58\%$ , up from  $57\%$  last year. This places us in the 70th percentile of internationally benchmarked companies for salaried employees.

Further sustainability information can be found on page 30 of the Annual Report, with this year's full Sustainability Report available on our website in late August.

# GOING FORWARD

Current economic conditions remain challenging and continue to impact consumer confidence with a strong shift in consumer behaviour to more value-conscious choices, which is expected to continue into the FY25 financial year.

Metcash's platform of three diversified businesses is fundamentally strong, and we have the right plans, teams and capabilities in place to deliver future growth as we work through the current economic cycle. We continue to work closely with our suppliers and retailers to maintain a value offering with a wide range of products at competitive prices and we are encouraged by our retailers' adaptability and ongoing ability to meet shoppers' needs.

Metcash's business remains sound. Our financial position is strong, our strategy continues to deliver and the addition of new channels through our recent acquisitions will help us to continue progressing our growth plans.

# THANKS

To the Metcash team, our independent retailers, suppliers and shareholders, on behalf of the whole Board, I would like to sincerely thank you for your support and contribution throughout the year.

I would also like to thank my fellow Directors for their commitment and ongoing support in a challenging but once again successful year.

I'm proud to be once again sharing a strong and pleasing set of results for FY24. Our portfolio of businesses is diverse, resilient, and performing well, and we have a solid platform for growth. Our purpose of Championing Successful Independents in upport of thriving local communities continues to guide our decisions and actions and remains at the core of both our strategy and our operating model.

Our strategy has been in place for some time now and has resulted in a portfolio and a platform that not only continues to deliver pleasing financial results, but also positions Metcash well for the future.

While each business is subject to the market conditions of the sector in which it operates, each one has a clear strategy and a structure that underpins these sustained results; and these remain in place.

This year the Food and Liquor pillars delivered another year of superb results and are now structurally positioned for enduring growth. They sell products which are essential for everyday living, and they could be described by some as the defensive elements of our portfolio; and they're poised for continued structural growth.

The Hardware pillar is proving resilient in a volatile economic climate and continuing to maintain its strong market position. The Hardware and Professional Tools businesses are more cyclical, being more dependent on market conditions. I am pleased that these businesses have held margins and protected profits in the current operating environment. They remain ideally positioned to benefit from an improvement in trading activity.

Logistics and wholesaling are at the core of the Metcash Flywheel and this strategy has proven to be an effective investment in our retailers and their businesses, their financial health, their overall margins, their operating capabilities, and the quality of their offer. We have continued to prioritise volume over margin expansion as this is what keeps our Flywheel spinning. This investment is paying off, evidenced by shoppers continuing to find our offer relevant in the face of the most value conscious environment in recent memory. Australian and New Zealand families and businesses are facing many challenges, evident in the sales of private label and in the trends towards promotions and discounts, and to less premium, better value choices. Customers are shopping promotions more, with smaller baskets and more frequent visits.

In the case of our building trade customers, they have reduced their advanced ordering as the visibility to future projects becomes less clear. Both these customers and our Hardware suppliers tell us they are experiencing a slowdown in activity and of course retailers, members and franchisees are facing the same challenges. However, they remain positive about the anticipated increase in building projects in the medium to long term.

Within our business we are responding to the economic climate in which we operate. Costs have been well managed, and we've delivered savings to offset cost of doing business (CODB) inflation ahead of those committed. We have delivered excellent cash conversion, underpinned by strong working capital management.

In that context, I am proud of our FY24 results; while we do not control the external environment, our team has controlled what we can superbly. These results are an indication that our strategy is working and continues to deliver improved resilience and diversification in the portfolio. We have performed at or better than the market trends in the markets we compete in. The portfolio results are as planned and as we would expect in these conditions, if not better.

# GROUP FINANCIALS

Group reported revenue, which excludes charge-through sales, increased 0.7% to  $15.9bn (FY23:$ 15.8bn). Including charge-through sales, Group revenue increased 0.7% to $18.2bn (FY23: $18.1bn) with growth in the Hardware and Liquor pillars more than offsetting a small decline in the Food pillar, driven by lower sales in tobacco. Group underlying EBIT decreased by 0.9% to $496.3m due to earnings growth in Food and Liquor being more than offset by lower earnings in Hardware and increased corporate costs. All pillars were supported by good operating discipline and the success of strategic initiatives, including acquisitions in Hardware. Superior Foods will be incorporated into Metcash's FY25 results from 3 June 2024 and will be reported within the Food pillar.

Group underlying profit after tax decreased \(8.2\%\) to \\(282.3m, reflecting lower earnings in the Hardware pillar and increased finance costs. Statutory profit after tax decreased \(0.7\%\) to \\)257.2m and includes the impact of \\(25.1m (after tax) of significant items in relation to Project Horizon, put option valuation adjustments, business acquisition costs and mega distribution centre transition costs.

The Group's cash flow performance was again a standout with operating cashflow increasing  $109.9m or 29.5\% to$ 482.6m (FY23: $372.7m), with the cash realisation ratio ~102% for the year. This results in an average three-year cash realisation ratio of ~90%.

A strong focus on working capital was a key driver of the result. Net debt at the end of the financial year was $251.9m (FY23: $349.6m), with average net debt $582m. The debt leverage ratio (DLR) at the end of FY24 was 0.45x (FY23: 0.62x) or 1.03x on average. After the end of the financial year the Company paid $390m for the purchase of Superior Foods (with a potential additional $22.3m earn-out due after the end of Superior Foods' financial year). Metcash expects to be in the mid to upper end of its target DLR range (1.0x to 1.75x) for the next two years.

The Board determined to pay a final dividend for FY24 of 8.5 cents per share, bringing total dividends for the year to 19.5 cents per share fully franked, in line with the target payout ratio of approximately  $70\%$  of underlying profit after tax. This represents the Company's strong cash performance balanced with its desire to invest in future growth opportunities.

# PILLAR FINANCIALS

# Food

Total Food sales (including charge-through and excluding tobacco) increased  $4.6\%$  with strong growth in both Supermarkets and Campbells & Convenience. Including tobacco, total Food sales declined  $0.5\%$ . In Supermarkets, the business continued to perform well in an environment of increased value-conscious shopping. Wholesale sales excluding tobacco were up  $4.7\%$ , underpinned by further improvement in network competitiveness and inflation.

The differentiated offer provided by the independent network continues to resonate with shoppers, who have retained IGA in their shopping repertoire even as they increasingly shop around in their search for value. Foot traffic into stores increased for the year, although items per basket declined. Sales of private label products increased  $15.5\%$ , and sales of items on promotion grew faster than those not on promotion. Sales volumes were positive for the year, with growth in the second half more than offsetting a small decline in the first half. Wholesale price inflation continued to moderate with inflation for the year at  $4.8\%$  (FY23:  $7.6\%$ ), and fourth quarter inflation down to  $2.4\%$ . The teamwork score ex-tobacco increased 1.6 percentage points to  $69.7\%$  and was flat at  $\sim 74\%$  including tobacco.

I'm pleased to advise that we've now completed all three strategic acquisitions - Bianco Construction Supplies and Alpine Truss in March and Superior Foods in early June.

The IGA retail network continued to invest in growth and remains healthy, strong and confident. There were a record 26 new store openings in the year, and 15 closures. Retail like-for-like sales growth in the IGA network was  $+2.2\%$  ex-tobacco. Tobacco sales declined  $13.9\%$  in the year due to an acceleration in illicit trade and the shift to alternatives.

In Campbells & Convenience, total sales excluding tobacco increased  $4.0\%$  reflecting stronger sales from major banner group customers. I am delighted to report that in late June Campbells & Convenience won a new supply agreement with Ampol Foodary for the provision of grocery products to their retail stores. This is a vote of confidence from an important new customer and bodies well for our business. Food EBIT increased  $3.0\%$  to $210.Im, reflecting the strong trading performance ex-tobacco, continued strong support from suppliers and the effective management of costs. The EBIT margin increased 7bps to  $2.2\%$ , largely reflecting the change in sales mix associated with the decline in tobacco sales, as well as good cost management.

The strong earnings performance and small margin expansion is pleasing under current conditions and is another year of evidence that this is a sustainable, robust business, operating within a healthy and successful independent network.

# Liquor

The Liquor pillar continued to outperform in a more challenging market with total sales (including charge-through) increasing \(1.7\%\) to \(5.2bn, with growth in sales to independent retail and contract customers more than offsetting a decline in on-premise sales.

This really is an exceptional trading performance once again for the Liquor pillar, delivering stellar sales and EBIT results. This is a market-leading sales result in an economic climate characterised by de-premiumisation, downtrading to better value choices and categories, and increased competition. In the face of all of that independents took share.

An increase in cost-of-living pressures continued to drive shopper focus on value, lower consumption and a decline in on-premise sales. Wholesale sales to retail and contract customers increased  $2.2\%$ , resulting in further market share gains. Sales growth was underpinned by continuation of the increased preference for localised offers, providing shoppers with conveniently located stores, tailored ranges, competitive prices and local friendly service. Sales to on-premise customers declined  $1.9\%$  in line with market trends, albeit some improvement was evident in the second half. The highest growth categories were again RTDs and beer, with cost-of-living pressures driving shopper preference for lower priced, better value choices.

Like Food, EBIT margins are underpinned by a strong trading result, good cost control, and excellent merchandising. Liquor EBIT increased  $4.9\%$  to  $\$ 109.2\mathrm{m}$ , reflecting the contribution from the business' strong trading performance, strategic buying and good cost management. The EBIT margin increased 6bps to  $2.1\%$ .

# Hardware

The Hardware pillar delivered a pleasing result in the face of a rapid slowing in builder confidence and reduced market activity. Total Hardware sales (including charge-through) increased \(2.7\%\) to \(3.5bn, with growth in Total Tools sales more than offsetting a decline in IHG sales. On a like-for-like basis, total Hardware sales declined \(2.7\%\). Total sales in the combined IHG and Total Tools retail networks were flat at \(\$4.5bn\). The IHG business withstood the challenging conditions to outperform the softer addressable market through strong relationships with trade customers, the success of the Whole of House strategy and an improved DIY offer. Sales for the year were broadly flat at \(\$2.8bn\) and declined \(3.0\%\) on a like-for-like basis. Scan sales for the IHG retail network increased \(0.3\%\) (LfL \(-2.6\%\)) with DIY \(+2.7\%\) and Trade \(-1.0\%\).

In the sector served by the Hardware pillar, building, DIY, and professional tools, the market has slowed significantly. Factors include higher for longer interest rates, lower consumer and home buyer confidence, builder capacity and viability, cost inflation, and quickly slowing product inflation, with some categories now in deflation.

In IHG, following a period of sustained exceptional sales and profit growth, the consolidation of these gains continues. I'm pleased by the second half cost out results that supported an EBIT improvement of  $2.7\%$  in H2, compared to the HI decline of  $12.2\%$ . Gross margins remained stable in wholesale and in retail, but lower volume and CODB pressure impacted on retail EBIT margins although these remained above pre-COVID levels.

The IHG business, through excellent customer relationships as you would see from the traction of the Whole of House strategy, remains ideally positioned to capitalise on an improvement in market conditions. The strategic position and my confidence in our ability to take advantage of an improvement in market conditions are further reinforced by our recent acquisitions.

In Total Tools, sales increased 16.4% to  $679.1m, largely reflecting the contribution from new stores and additional majority-owned joint venture stores. On a like-for-like basis, sales declined 1.3%. Retail network sales for Total Tools increased 2.6% to$ 1,112.3m. On a like-for-like basis, sales declined 2.3%, reflecting more challenging market conditions and intense pricing pressure in the market, particularly in the fourth quarter. Foot traffic was down in both the first and second half, but customer conversions increased, driven by Total Tools' competitiveness and leading market position. The pricing pressure had a short-term impact on Total Tools' gross margin as the business responded to protect market share. Margins normalised towards the end of the fourth quarter following more precise and strategic responses by Total Tools.

Hardware EBIT decreased  $3.8\%$  to  $\$210.9\mathrm{m}$ , with both IHG and Total Tools delivering lower earnings compared to FY23. The year included a significant increase in regulatory costs (primarily in Victoria), higher labour and occupancy costs, and other cost inflation. On a like-for-like basis, Hardware EBIT declined  $11.0\%$ . In IHG, EBIT decreased  $4.9\%$  to  $\$129.0\mathrm{m}$ , reflecting the impact of lower sales volumes and additional costs. An increase in cost savings initiatives in the second half enabled the business to offset most of the additional costs and helped return the business to EBIT growth for the half.

In Total Tools, EBIT was \(81.9m, a decline of 1.9% or 11.5% on a like-for-like basis, and includes the one-off adverse impact associated with its transition to the new Ravenhall, Victoria distribution centre in the first half, and the increase in competitive intensity experienced in the fourth quarter. Total Tools EBIT margins continue to trend towards retail levels as the proportion of earnings from owned retail stores increases. The Hardware EBIT margin was \(6.1\%\) with IHG \(4.6\%\) and Total Tools \(12.1\%\).

# STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS

I'm pleased to advise that we've now completed all three strategic acquisitions - Bianco Construction Supplies and Alpine Truss in March and Superior Foods at the start of June. Superior further strengthens the Food offer and opens new growth opportunities in the adjacent food service market. The acquisitions of Bianco and Alpine support IHG's Whole of House strategy and strengthen our market position. Superior is on track to earn a full earnout and is performing well.

# LOCKING FORWARD

Looking ahead to FY25, our immediate priorities are integrating and extracting the synergies from our recent acquisitions, completing and moving into the new distribution centre in Truganina, Victoria, and progressing on our core technology programs, including Horizon where we're making steady progress and costs remain well-managed. This does remain a large and complex program, and we continue to be focused on balancing cost, time, quality and risk to deliver the project.

So, together with the team I'm pleased to share where we are, the position we are in, and I'm thrilled and excited by the opportunities before us.

# THANKS

The execution by each of the Pillars of their strategy has underpinned their performance and I would like to thank our team for their dedication and effort in navigating the challenging market conditions to deliver great results again this year.

I would also like to recognise and thank our independent partners for their support. Across all pillars our alignment and relationships with our customers remain strong, even in these testing times. Our independent retailers really are a national treasure, and we are proud to support and continue to champion them all.

The acquisition of Superior Foods, a leading Australian foodservice distribution business, was announced to the market in February 2024 and completed in June 2024 - cementing Metcash's position as the largest wholesaler and distributor of food to independent businesses in Australia.

Superior Foods services corporate and independent businesses across Australia in a diverse range of markets including quick service restaurants, corporate caterers, cafes, restaurants and hotels. A complementary business to our existing foodservice offering, the acquisition of Superior Foods is a logical extension of our Food strategy.

The Superior Foods acquisition provides an exciting opportunity to further strengthen and diversify the Metcash Food offering by combining assets and supply chains. Superior Foods has 23 branches across Australia with total warehouse space of  $\sim 80,000$  sqm, as well as a fleet of  $\sim 290$  vehicles performing  $\sim 670,000$  deliveries annually.

Beyond initial synergies to be realised, the acquisition brings many benefits for both Metcash and Superior Foods' independent customers. Our customers will benefit from an expanded catalogue and being able to access more items more often, while suppliers will also benefit from access to a larger customer base.

The food service industry is a fast-growing market, underpinned by favourable long-term consumer trends towards convenience and out-of-home dining, which strategically positions Metcash to capitalise on new growth opportunities.

# HARDWARE

Both Hardware acquisitions announced in February 2024, completed in March 2024, are examples of consolidation in the fragmented hardware market and are highly complementary to our existing IHG business. These acquisitions support IHG's 'Whole of House' strategy, to supply at least  $50\%$  of the house build through all stages of construction, as well as its network expansion strategy.

# BIANCO CONSTRUCTION SUPPLIES

EXPECTED ANNUALISED SYNERGIES

The acquisition of Bianco Construction Supplies, a construction and industrial supplies business serving the South Australia and Northern Territory trade markets, significantly boosts our share of the trade market in South Australia  $(>14\%)$ .

This strategic acquisition strengthens IHG's 'Whole of House' offering and enhances our customer proposition in those markets, particularly during the foundation stage of construction projects. The Bianco brand is to be retained, which will assist us to achieve substantial scale with minimal investment.

EXPECTED ANNUALISED SYNERGIES

Alpine Truss is renowned for its strong heritage and established relationships, coupled with a strong reputation for producing leading quality products.

The largest frame and truss facility in the IHG network, Alpine Truss adds significant capacity to our operations and substantially enhances our offering in Victoria, southern New South Wales, and entry into the ACT market. Importantly, this strategic acquisition allows us to scale operations with minimal investment, further solidifying our market presence and offering.

# INDEPENDENT HARDWARE GROUP (IHG)

IHG is the leading wholesale partner to independent hardware stores and is the second-largest player in the Australian hardware market. Established in 1959 as a buying group for a small cohort of hardware stores, IHG's Mitre 10 brand celebrates its 65th anniversary in 2024.

IHG remains dedicated to its rich heritage of building successful independents. Today, the IHG network comprises \(\sim 610\) banned stores, predominantly operating under the Mitre 10 and Home Hardware brands, generating network sales of \(\sim \\) 2.8\( billion in FY24. IHG supports the largest network of independent hardware stores in Australia, including an additional \)\sim 950\( unbannered stores and 24 frame and truss facilities.

With a diverse portfolio of entrepreneurial store owners and strategic initiatives helping Australians build great houses and turning houses into homes, growing both Trade and DIY customers, Hardware pillar (IHG and Total Tools) earnings have grown  $150\%$  since 2020. The Company has outperformed in a softer construction market in FY24 and is well positioned to capitalise on improved activity levels.

# Network growth

IHG has a strong track record of successful acquisitions and continues to be a natural consolidator in a highly fragmented market, supported by the recent acquisitions of Bianco Construction Supplies and Alpine Truss.

The strategic combination of independent, joint-venture (JV) and Company-owned retail stores is pivotal to IHG's growth, protecting and enhancing the network while boosting wholesale sales and improving store profitability. This retail strategy not only benefits independent retailers but also supports Metcash, reinforcing the network and facilitating its expansion. The network now consists of  $\sim 150$  JV and Company-owned sites, encompassing Bianco Construction Supplies and Alpine Truss sites.

The IHG network continues to grow with 42 new independent families joining the Group in the last three years. With a target of five new bannered store openings per year, this continued expansion will be facilitated through various ownership models, including JV and Company-owned stores. IHG has identified over 200 potential new site opportunities, leveraging a mix of strategies such as consolidation of existing sites, redevelopment of 'brownfield' locations, and development of new 'greenfield' sites. This varied approach will ensure the continuation of a sustainable growth trajectory for the network.

# Growth through collaboration

Network growth is also driven through collaboration between Mitre 10 and Total Tools stores. By setting up side-by-side in one location, a combined Mitre 10 and Total Tools site can deliver a strong regional offer and attract a broader customer base by appealing to both DIY enthusiasts and professional tradespeople. Joint locations also drive floor space productivity by optimising the use of retail space and enhancing the shopping experience.

With 10 stores already operational and four additional sites in the pipeline – this partnership is well established and continues to expand. This collaborative offering not only provides a better experience for customers by providing a more comprehensive product range and expertise but also drives positive sales and EBIT results, ensuring strong financial returns for both entities.

# Build Trade - helping Australians build great houses

In Trade, IHG continues to focus on servicing the small-medium home builder market and has performed well in difficult conditions, well above the housing market.

Currently, IHG supplies  $46\%$  of the house build, from foundations through to fit-out, with a target to supply at least  $50\%$  through its Whole of House strategy. Our growing network of frame and truss facilities are integral to this strategy, with the acquisition of Alpine Truss extending these services to customers in the Victorian, ACT, and southern NSW markets. While our network of 50 Sapphire-standard standalone trade centres has further strengthened our market presence.

SALES REVENUE (INCLUDING CHARGE-THROUGH)

\$3.5bn 2.7%

68% since FY20 (Reported $2.5bn)

# Grow DIY - turning houses into family homes

We continue to increase our share of the DIY market, with sales growth well above market. We do this by offering a differentiated product range through exclusive and private brands, as well as providing DIY customers with a high-level of customer service across all channels – in home, in store and online.

The Sapphire store strategy continues to deliver growth in DIY, helping our retailers be the 'Best Store in Their Town'. There are now 222 stores in the network that have completed upgrades under the Sapphire program, with 32 stores upgraded in 2024. On average, stores have seen  $>24\%$  sales lift over three years after completing the store upgrade.

Design10 showrooms continue to provide a differentiated experience for both consumers and builders, setting new standards in customer engagement and service excellence.

# Digital, data and insights

Our digital enablement programs have not only improved the online experience for both DIY and trade customers but also boosted productivity across the network and supply chain.

Consumer led insights from our loyalty programs and e-commerce platforms have further enhanced the customer experience. We've increased the number of active members in our loyalty program by  $+9\%$  to  $\sim 1.75$  million in FY24. In addition, we've seen a lift in sales from loyalty members of  $+7\%$  since last financial year.

Gubbins-Pulbrook Mitre 10, Milton, NSW

# CASE STUDY

# GUBBINS PULBROOK MITRE 10 GROUP

Nick Gubbins and Steve Pulbrook have been serving trade customers in the Southern Highlands and South Coast region for over a decade, with Moss Vale Mitre 10 recently celebrating its 10-year anniversary. They've also recently opened a Total Tools store in Mittagong.

The pair came together to create the Gubbins Pulbrook Mitre 10 Group in 2018 when IHG approached them with an opportunity to purchase additional sites in the area and Nick and Steve saw benefit in joining forces. Initially attracted to the strength of the Mitre 10 brand and model, Gubbins Pulbrook now operates five stores in the Southern Highlands and South Coast region, with their successful expansion spurred on by the Sapphire program.

Completing the Sapphire store upgrade program in their Milton and Moss Vale stores was a 'no brainer', as they knew with a tried and tested model their stores would be at a standard that would guarantee they were the 'Best Store in Their Town'.

RICHARD MURRAY

CEO, TOTAL TOOLS

# TOTAL TOOLS

Metcash increased its ownership in Total Tools Holdings, the largest professional tools retailer in Australia, from  $85\%$  to  $100\%$  in late November 2023.

With a wide range supported by long-term supplier partnerships, Total Tools services a broad customer base across industries including housing, refurbishment, renovation, service, maintenance and infrastructure.

Since Metcash acquired majority ownership in 2020, the business has delivered remarkable growth with annual sales in the retail network doubling from  $585m in FY20 to$ 1.1bn in FY24. Leveraging Metcash's platform and capabilities has resulted in strong returns over the past three years.

# Store network

Consistent with the successful approach in IHG, Metcash's growth strategy for Total Tools includes a diverse network structure with a mix of independently owned and joint venture retail stores. The Company maintains a strong focus on supporting its franchise and retail network, with joint ventures now comprising  $\sim 45\%$  of its store network.

A key driver of growth has been the expansion of the retail store network, with 8 new stores opened in FY24. Total Tools is on track to deliver its ambitious growth plans of 145 stores by FY26, with a longer-term target of  $170+$  stores.

# Retailer of choice for major tool distribution partners

With strong and entrenched relationships with most major tool distribution partners, Total Tools is the largest professional tool specialist retailer in ANZ for many of our distribution partners. Total Tools is positioned well to capitalise on opportunities in the expanding outdoor cordless and commercial markets, with a presence in all major tool categories.

# Digital platforms

Total Tools offers a strong omni-channel shopping experience through physical stores, online platforms and a mobile app. Data insights driven by a single ERP drive fast and effective decision making across the business, boosting efficiencies and productivity.

'Insiders rewards', Total Tools' market-leading loyalty program, drives high customer engagement (NPS  $80\% +$  and accounts for over  $90\%$  of sales.

Metcash Food is the largest supplier to independent food businesses in Australia. We service a network of  $\sim 1,280$ IGA banned independent supermarkets, including those that operate under the Foodland and Supa Valu brands. We provide them with marketing and operational support so they can be the ‘Best Store in Their Town’. We also supply many other independent supermarkets across the country, trading under various other brands.

Through Campbells and our convenience business, we are a leading wholesale food distributor serving multiple non-supernarket channels such as service stations and convenience stores. The acquisition of Superior Foods extends our distribution to include foodservice and hospitality outlets nationwide.

Post-acquisition of Superior Foods, our business has become more diverse, with a much broader base of sales across convenience and foodservice, as well as our supermarket business. We have transformed from a traditional food wholesaler to an integrated wholesaler, banner-operator and retailer, with stronger customer and supplier relationships.

The business has continued to grow post-COVID with sales up  $25\%$  since 2020, supported by better stores and better value for shoppers. We continue to focus on growing market share and accelerating our growth by expanding the store network and improving store sales. We opened 26 stores during the year.

# STRENGTHENING THE STORE NETWORK

In addition to expanding the network, we have continued to focus on improving the competitiveness of the store network by lifting our store standards and offering better value to shoppers, which has never been more important with the increase in value-conscious shoppers in the current cost-of-living crisis.

By working closely with suppliers we've been able to continue to deliver great value through our Low Price Every Day and Price Match programs, and we're pleased that shoppers have responded by keeping IGA in their repertoire of stores and visiting us more often. We have also seen increased distribution for our private label Community Co and Black & Gold ranges, leading to sales growth of over  $15 \%$ in FY24.

Our independent retailers continue to support our growth strategies by reinvesting in their stores, with an additional 120 stores completing the Diamond Store Accelerator store upgrade program during the year. We also saw continued increase in adoption of the IGA Rewards loyalty program, with 775 stores now live.

# FURTHER GROWTH THROUGH DIGITAL PLATFORMS

Sorted is both a digital B2B marketplace and a provider of value-added services, with the aim of becoming a 'one stop shop' for Metcash retailers. Customers using Sorted have access to a wide product range from not only our own warehouses but also to the extensive catalogues of direct-to-store suppliers who use our established Charge Through process, with over 80,000 lines now available on the platform.

We have seen an acceleration in the take-up of Sorted over the last year with  $98\%$  of charge-through orders now captured by the platform. Over 1,000 stores have integrated their back-office systems with Sorted, making it far more efficient to manage direct-to-store products, track pricing and orders, process invoices and resolve claims. The two-way information also provides valuable insights including products that are performing well in other stores.

A selected range of Superior Foods products are now available to IGA customers on the platform, and Sorted will become the digital platform for Campbells and ALM customers in 2025, taking the number of Metcash customers on the platform to  $\sim 50,000$

# INDEPENDENT MEDIA CENTRE

We continue to develop our independent retail media network, connecting suppliers to shoppers, to unlock significant revenue opportunities for independents. An independent retail media network will enable suppliers to advertise to thousands of local communities and small businesses across Australia. The Food business completed a successful pilot of in-store screens in the second half of FY24, with positive results.

Greg Rice is the owner of The Market Place Ballajura IGA in Perth, WA and is Chair of the IGA WA State Board.

The Sorted platform has helped us connect with suppliers and products that we didn't even know existed. It's been really beneficial.  
Traditionally, we would talk to individual suppliers, ring them up, ask them what the price is, and what they've got in stock; but now we can find out all the list of products in one place. We can find out all their pricing straight away and we can make an order within a couple of minutes.  
"The most valuable feature that I've found is being able to do orders on the floor with our ordering device and then being able to submit them on the fly."

Australian Liquor Marketers (ALM), the wholesale arm of the Liquor pillar, has a strong market position as the second-largest supplier of liquor in Australia, supplying  $\sim 85\%$  of independent liquor stores nationwide. In addition to supplying liquor stores, ALM's on-premise liquor division supplies bars, pubs, restaurants and hotels.

Operating under our Independent Banner Group (IBA) there is a strong group of national retail brands including Cellarbrations, Bottle-O, Porters and IGA Liquor. IBA is the largest network of Bannered independent liquor stores in Australia and New Zealand, with  $>1,750$  stores. We support IBA Bannered retailers through a framework that offers national buying power, marketing support, shopper-focused promotional programs and network investment to provide 'The Best Store in Their Town'.

We support independent businesses with a competitively priced and extensive liquor range, delivered through our cost-effective and efficient supply chain. Our shared distribution network with the Food pillar provides wholesale scale for our competitive advantage – we are the only scaled national logistics network serving independents in liquor.

Liquor has achieved significant growth and continued to gain market share in recent years with sales up  $40\%$  since 2020. With large contract customers in both retail and on-premise, a diverse customer base means the business is well-positioned to adapt to changes in consumer demand and trends.

# DIFFERENTIATED SHOPPER VALUE

Our retail locations are convenient, with local ranging tailored to each local market, as well as local knowledgeable and friendly service. We continue to grow the IBA store network, with 14 Tier 1 Bannered stores joining in the last 12 months.

Cost-of-living pressures have driven an increased focus on value in store, and our growing range of owned and exclusive (O&E) products help our retailers by providing improved margins and a point of difference to help them compete against the major chains by providing exceptional value to shoppers.

Our purpose of Championing Successful Independents extends to our suppliers - in the last three years alone we have onboarded  $\sim 420$  new suppliers, including many small and independent businesses. Diversifying our supplier base supports a differentiated and tailored range in-store for shoppers.

# PLATINUM PROGRAM

We have continued to see strong collaboration and commitment between retailers, suppliers and IBA with the pilot of our Platinum program. This strategic initiative focuses on improving store standards, growing our loyalty programs and providing better quality data and insights. As a result, the program increases value for shoppers, improves sales and margins for retailers, provides better return-on-investment for suppliers and increases volumes for IBA.

As part of the Platinum Program, we continue to improve the store experience with the rollout of our best-in-class store fit-outs and coolroom upgrades, with stores experiencing an average sales uplift of  $13\%$  after completing the program.

Our eCommerce and loyalty programs have driven better quality data and insights. There are now 231 stores participating in the IBA loyalty program, with more in the pipeline, and  $+41,000$  loyalty members, with membership numbers continuing to grow. Our rollout of ALM R.O.S.S (Retailer One Stop Shop) is now complete, making it frictionless for our retailers to do business with us.

Further growth opportunities are underpinned by an acceleration of our Network of the Future program and our 'extended aisle' offering through the launch of ALM Connect, our supplier portal, on Sorted, our B2B marketplace for Food and Liquor. Launching ALM Connect on Sorted significantly speeds up supplier onboarding and improves back-office processes for both our customers and suppliers.

# CASE STUDY

# CELLARBRATIONS, GROYDON, VIC

Earlier this year, Fiona Duan and her husband, Leon Wang, opened their first Cellarbrations store in Croydon, Victoria after spotting an opportunity in the local market for a high-quality liquor store.

Locals to the area, they chose the Cellarbrations banner because of its alignment with the quality image they wanted for their store and for their community.

Committed to supporting local producers, they have included offerings from Coldstream vineyards and plan to expand their local range, given their proximity to the Yarra Valley wine region.

The community response has been overwhelmingly positive, with shoppers appreciating the presence of a new, independently-owned liquor store in their area, that not only looks great but also supports the local economy.

Encouraged by their initial success in Croydon, Fiona and her husband are already looking to expand their operations with a second store in Elsternwick set to open later this year.

# SUSTAINABILITY HIGHLIGHTS

We have continued to make significant progress in FY24 towards our long-term sustainability targets and in improving our ESG credentials. This progress was reflected in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, which positioned Metcash in the 89th percentile, up from the 87th percentile in FY23. Our improvement in this broad metric demonstrates our ongoing efforts to create a sustainable future by implementing responsible business practices across the organisation.

In preparation for the anticipated requirement to report under the new Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards(ASRS 2 Climate-related Financial Disclosures) we completed a review of the standards and its alignment to our existing reporting practices, which to date have been guided by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and Task Force on Climate Financial Disclosures (TCFD). A cross functional working group has been established to address identified gaps in the core areas of governance, strategy, risk management and metrics and targets, to ensure we comply with ASRS requirements by FY26. This will also mean a shift in reporting of environmental performance data periods to align with the Metcash financial year and obtaining assurance in line with ASRS requirements.

For further detail, please refer to the full Sustainability Report published on our website (www.metcash.com/sustainability) in late August 2024.

We remain committed to creating an inclusive and equitable workplace and are pleased to have maintained a neutral gender pay gap of  $\sim 1\%$  across the organisation.

We were recognised by Equileap in their Top 100 companies globally for gender equality, ranking 45th in 2024.

We have also successfully achieved our gender diversity target of 40:40:20,

with the following representation:

- Metcash Board: 50%  
Group Leadership Team (GLT): >50%  
Key Management Personnel (KMP), Executives, and General Managers (GM):  $42\%$

Our key safety measure, the Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR), has shown significant improvement, recording a  $21\%$  year-on-year decrease to 14.32. This reflects our continuous efforts to ensure a safe working environment for all employees, and reflects our revised Safety, Health and Environment (SHE) strategy.

Our engagement survey results have placed us in the 70th percentile of internationally benchmarked companies for TEC employees, with a score of  $58\%$  up from  $57\%$  in FY23. This improvement in employee satisfaction highlights our continued efforts to ensure Metcash is considered a 'favourite place to work'.

We have met our interim 2030

emissions target for FY24, reducing our emissions to 69,695 tCO $_2$ e, which represents a  $5.2\%$  decrease from FY23.

This achievement underscores our efforts to reduce our carbon footprint and our longer-term goal of 2040 net-zero emissions reduction target for Scope 1 and Scope 2. In Scope 3, we've continued to expand our data capture and methodologies across greenhouse gas (GHG) protocol categories, including end-of-life treatment of sold products.

We continue to work towards our waste-to-landfill diversion target of  $80\%$  by 2028, with an interim achievement of  $65.9\%$  in FY24. To assist in driving our waste avoidance and recycling goals, Metcash obtained a $500,000 grant from the NSW Environment Protection Authority under its Bin Trim Networks Program in late 2023. Metcash was one of just 14 companies selected to participate in the three-year program, which aims to divert 35,000 tonnes of waste from landfill each year by helping businesses implement circular economy solutions.

We have made considerable progress toward, and are on track to meet, our 2025 responsible sourcing commitments for palm oil, seafood, cocoa, paper-based products, animal welfare, eggs and coffee.

We are committed to supporting the community to address issues such as food security.

Through our partnerships with Foodbank, OzHarvest and Food4Change, we have provided over 2.6 million meals to those in need in FY24. Our IGA stores also contributed over $2.7m to approximately 1,600 organisations this year as part of the IGA Community Chest program.

We were the first supermarket business to join the National Plastics Recycling Scheme in January 2024, which supports a solution that facilitates maximum uptake on soft plastics recycling across the community and therefore the best chance for a closed loop on plastic. This initiative aligns with our broader sustainability goals and our support for national targets for increased material recovery and an improved circular economy.

Metcash remains focused on reviewing and addressing modern slavery risks in our operations and supply chain through continuous improvement in governance, policy and monitoring. Our progress in this area was recognised by the independent Modern Slavery Statement Disclosure Quality Assessment by Monash University, where we received an improved 'B' rating in its latest review.

Our sustainability efforts in FY24 have continued to progress across the board, creating a positive impact on our people, the planet and the community.

# OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW

# 1. METCASH'S BUSINESS MODEL

Metcash is Australia's leading wholesaler and distributor, supplying and supporting an extensive network of independent retailers which form part of our banned network and several other unbannered businesses across the Food, Hardware and Liquor pillars. Metcash's retail customers operate some of Australia's leading independent brands including: IGA, Foodland, Mitre 10, Home Hardware, Total Tools, Cellarbrations, IGA Liquor and the Bottle-O. We help them to be the 'Best Store in their Town' by providing merchandising, operational and marketing support.

Metcash operates a low-cost distribution model that enables independent retailers to compete against the vertically integrated retail chains and other competitors. The Group's core competencies include: procurement, logistics, marketing, retail development and retail operational support. Metcash operates major distribution centres in all the mainland states of Australia which are complemented by a number of smaller warehouses and a portfolio of corporate and joint venture stores.

The Group employs over 9,000 people and indirectly supports employment in the independent retail network.

# 2. STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES

Metcash's purpose is 'Championing Successful Independents in support of Thriving Local Communities' to create sustainable shareholder value.

Metcash's vision includes:

supporting independent retailers to be the best store in their town;  
- being passionate about independents;  
- being a favourite place to work;  
- being a business partner of choice for suppliers and independents;  
supporting thriving communities; and  
- creating a sustainable future.

At the core of Metcash's strategy is to further improve the competitiveness of independent retail networks. This includes continuing to improve the quality and value of the offer to shoppers, and in strengthening and growing Metcash's own, and its network's capabilities to deliver value to Metcash's retailers and suppliers.

Metcash achieves its strategy through its flywheel, which captures the key competitive advantages that set it apart, at its heart is logistics to support the end-to-end supply chain, followed by Metcash's strategy to nurture brands and formats that shoppers love to shop in, and independent entrepreneurs want to invest in and run; and finally Metcash's support and services provided to help independents compete with the larger chain stores.

Metcash remains committed to investing in growth and have a significant and expanding pipeline of opportunities across the Food, Hardware and Liquor pillars. All capital investments are assessed through a disciplined process that includes consideration of the investment's strategic fit and ability to meet financial return hurdles.

# 3. KEY DEVELOPMENTS

# Business Acquisitions

# Bianco Construction Supplies

In March 2024, Metcash acquired a  $100\%$  ownership interest in Bianco Construction Supplies. Bianco is the leading independent building materials supplier in the South Australian market, servicing builders, concreters, bricklayers, and landscapers from 10 sites.

The acquisition supports Metcash's Independent Hardware Group (IHG)'s 'Whole of House' growth strategy which focuses on increasing the proportion of material supplied by IHG in the building of a house (i.e. across the foundations, frame & truss, lock up, fix and fit out steps). It broadens IHG's offer and presence in South Australia and the Northern Territory and provides access to key trades not currently serviced. It is also complementary to Metcash's company owned K&B business in South Australia and other independents in South Australia and Northern Territory.

# Alpine Truss

In March 2024, Metcash acquired a  $100\%$  ownership interest in Alpine Truss. Alpine Truss is one of the largest Frame & Truss operations in Australia and operates a large fabrication plant in Wangaratta, Victoria. The business services small to large volume builders across Victoria and Southern New South Wales.

Frame & Truss is a key element of Metcash's IHG 'Whole of House' growth strategy. The acquisition extends IHG's network of Frame & Truss operations across Australia to 24, of which 12 are wholly owned by Metcash or partly owned under joint venture. The acquisition enables access to the previously under-represented Victoria and Australian Capital Territory Frame & Truss markets.

# Total Tools

In November 2023, Metcash increased its ownership from  $85\%$  to  $100\%$  in Total Tools Holdings Pty Ltd (TTH), which is the parent entity in the Total Tools Group, following the exercise of a put option by the holders of the minority  $15\%$  ownership interest. The purchase consideration for the remaining  $15\%$  interest of $101.5 million was paid on 30 November 2023 and was accounted for as a reduction in the associated put option liability to nil. The Total Tools business is a complementary business to the Hardware pillar and forms part of the largest professional tools retail network in Australia.

In addition, Metcash has reset its put option arrangements with a number of its Total Tools joint venture (JV) stores. This is to provide JV partners with a balance between receiving some capital upfront and remaining both vested and engaged in the ongoing success of their stores through continued equity interest.

During FY24, Metcash has reset put option arrangements for 11 JV stores by acquiring an additional ownership interest upfront and deferring the put option in relation to the residual ownership interest by a further three years.

In conjunction with the above JV reset, Metcash also reduced its ownership interest in 6 corporate stores from an FY23 ownership interest of  $100\%$  to an ownership interest of between  $51\%$  and  $70\%$ . Metcash has issued put options in relation to these stores over the residual ownership interest of between  $30\%$  and  $49\%$ , exercisable in May 2027 (4 stores) and May 2030 (2 stores).

Further, during the year, Metcash's Total Tools retail store ownership continued to expand with the acquisition of ownership interests of  $51\%$  in five Total Tools independent retail stores, together with the establishment of two greenfield JV stores.

At balance date, Metcash has ownership of between  $51\%$  and  $95\%$  in 51 Total Tools JV stores. Put and call option arrangements exist which enable Metcash to acquire  $100\%$  of all 51 Total Tools JV stores across FY25 to FY31. Further details are set out in notes 5.3 and 6.1 of the financial report.

# Project Horizon

Project Horizon is a critical group technical infrastructure consolidation and replacement program aimed at repositioning Metcash to be a modern, technology-led wholesaler. The program provides the platform to drive simplification and efficiency across the Food and Liquor businesses, as well as making it easier for customers and suppliers to do business with Metcash. The program continues to make steady progress, most recently delivering a streamlined all-in-one payables solution. The program is expected to be completed by the end of FY26.

In FY24, the Group incurred $20.6 million (FY23: $34.6 million) of expenses on the project. The project expenses included resource costs, accelerated amortisation and impairment of redundant software assets and incremental software licence and maintenance costs. These costs are separately disclosed within significant items in the Statement of Comprehensive Income to enable a better understanding of the Group's results.

# Changes in key management personnel (KMP)

Ms Deepa Sita was appointed as Group CFO in February 2024 to succeed Mr Alistair Bell following his retirement from the role.

Ms Kylie Wallbridge was appointed as CEO ALM in March 2024 following the retirement of Mr Chris Baddock due to health reasons.

Mr Richard Murray was appointed as CEO Total Tools in January 2024 to succeed Mr Paul Dumbrell who had decided to step down after more than five years in the role.

# Dividend declaration

The Board has determined to pay a fully franked final FY24 dividend of 8.5 cents per share, which brings total dividends for the year to 19.5 cents per share fully franked, which represents a dividend payout ratio of  $71.0\%$  of underlying profit after tax.

# 4. KEY FINANCIAL MEASURES

# Warehouse earnings

Metcash's operations are designed to allow significant volumes to be distributed through its warehouse infrastructure at a relatively fixed cost base. The ability to leverage volumes through the warehouse is a key driver of profitability for both Metcash and the independent retail network.

In addition to warehouse revenue, earnings are impacted by product category mix and the proportion of the Group's products bought by the network. Warehouse revenue and related margins are driven by competitive pricing, promotional activities and the level of supplier support through volumetric and other rebates.

Metcash also operates a portfolio of corporate and joint venture retail stores, predominantly in the Hardware pillar.

Metcash has a number of key programs in place to drive sales and margins, including through pricing and promotion, product range, retail operational standards and consumer alignment.

# Cost of doing business

The Group's profitability depends on the efficiency and effectiveness of its operating model. This is achieved by optimising the Group's cost of doing business ('CODB') which comprises the various costs of operating the distribution centres, retail stores and the administrative support functions.

The Group continues to have a strong focus on both revenue growth and maintaining a sustainable cost base.

# DIRECTORS' REPORT CONTINUED

# Funds employed and return on capital

The Group's funds employed is primarily influenced by the seasonal working capital cycle. The Group has longer term capital investments predominantly in relation to its supply chain capabilities, including warehouse automation technologies and software development. In Hardware, the Group has acquired a network of corporate and JV retail stores. The Group also invests alongside the independent retail network, mainly in the form of equity participation or short-term loans.

The Board's intention is to continue to invest in the business for future growth while maintaining a strong financial position and otherwise to assess returning surplus capital to shareholders.

# Climate change and sustainability disclosure

In June 2023, the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) published the first two IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards. In October 2023, the Australian Accounting Standards Board published its Exposure Draft on the Australian-specific climate-related financial disclosure standard, based on IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures. In March 2024, the Treasurer introduced into Parliament the Treasury Laws Amendment (Financial Market Infrastructure and Other Measures) Bill 2024. As described in Chapter 4 of the Explanatory Memorandum, this Bill contains amendments that set out new climate-related financial reporting requirements for entities that are required to lodge financial reports under Chapter 2M of the Corporations Act 2001. The introduction of the Bill follows the release of exposure draft legislation on climate-related financial disclosures earlier in the year.

Based on the exposure draft legislation, Metcash will be considered a Group 1 entity and required to prepare its first sustainability report in FY26. At the time of writing, the draft timetable for levels and scope of assurance is yet to be finalised through the legislation.

Metcash already discloses information related to greenhouse gas emissions and targets, transition risks, physical risks, climate-related opportunities and climate metrics in line with Task Force for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures. Current information on our climate response and associated metrics and targets can be sourced in Metcash's Sustainability Report. The management of climate-related risks and opportunities at Metcash is overseen by its ESG Council through the Climate Change Risk Register. These various risks are combined and represented in an overall Climate Risk category in the Group Risk Profile.

(a) EBIT and UPAT excludes significant items as identified in note 3.3 of the financial report.  
(b) Underlying earnings per share (UEPS) is calculated by dividing UPAT by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.

Group reported revenue, which excludes charge-through sales<sup>1</sup>, increased 0.7% to  $15.9 billion (FY23:$ 15.8 billion). Including charge-through sales<sup>1</sup>, Group revenue increased 0.7% to  $18.2 billion (FY23:$ 18.1 billion) with growth in the Hardware and Liquor pillars more than offsetting a small decline in the Food pillar, driven by lower sales in tobacco.

Group underlying EBIT decreased by  $0.9\%$  to  $\$496.3$ million due to earnings growth in Food and Liquor being more than offset by lower earnings in Hardware and increased corporate costs. All pillars were supported by good operating discipline and the success of strategic initiatives, including acquisitions in Hardware. Superior Foods will be incorporated in Metcash’s FY25 results from 3 June 2024.

The Food pillar continued to perform well in an environment of increased value-conscious shopping, providing further evidence of its shift to a sustainable and resilient business model. Earnings increased  $3\%$  to $210.1 million, reflecting its strong trading performance.

The Liquor pillar continued to perform strongly underpinned by its diversified customer strategy and the ongoing preference for localised liquor offers. Earnings increased  $4.9\%$  to $109.2 million, reflecting the strong trading performance, strategic buying and good cost management.

The Hardware pillar delivered pleasing results in a market of rapidly slowing builder confidence and reduced market activity. IHG continued to outperform market trends, while Total Tools faced significantly increased competition in the second half. Earnings decreased  $3.8\%$  to  $\$210.9$  million, reflecting the more challenging conditions and increased cost pressures. Pleasingly, IHG margins remain above its historical trend (pre COVID).

Group underlying profit after tax $^2$  decreased 8.2% to  $282.3 million, reflecting lower earnings in the Hardware pillar and increased finance costs. Statutory profit after tax decreased 0.7% to$ 257.2 million and includes the impact of $25.1 million (after tax) of significant items in relation to Project Horizon, put option valuation adjustments, business acquisition costs and mega distribution centre transition costs.

(a) Segment revenue excludes gross charge-through sales to customers of  $2.267 billion (FY23:$ 2.249 billion). Refer note 3.2.

# Food

Total Food sales (including charge-through<sup>1</sup> and excluding tobacco) increased  $4.6\%$ , with strong growth in both Supermarkets and Campbells and Convenience. Including tobacco, total Food sales declined  $0.5\%$ .

In Supermarkets, the business continued to perform well in an environment of increased value-conscious shopping. Wholesale sales excluding tobacco were up  $4.7\%$  underpinned by further improvement in network competitiveness and inflation. The independent network offer continues to resonate, with shoppers retaining IGA in their shopping repertoire even as they increasingly shop around in their search for value. Foot traffic into stores increased for the year, albeit items per basket declined reflecting cost of living pressures on household grocery budgets. Sales of private label products increased  $15.5\%$ , and sales of items on promotion grew faster than those not on promotion.

Sales volumes<sup>3</sup> were positive for the year, with growth in the second half more than offsetting a small decline in the first half. Wholesale price inflation continued to moderate with inflation<sup>3</sup> for the year at  $4.8\%$  (FY23:  $7.6\%$ ), and fourth quarter inflation down to  $2.4\%$ . The teamwork score ex-tobacco increased 1.6 percentage points to  $69.7\%$ , and was flat at  $\sim 74\%$  including tobacco.

The IGA retail network continued to invest in growth and remains healthy, strong and confident. There were a record 26 new store openings in the year, and 15 closures. Retail like for like sales growth in the IGA network was  $+2.2\%$  ex-tobacco.

Tobacco sales declined  $13.9\%$  in the year due to an acceleration in illicit trade and the shift to alternatives.

In Campbells and Convenience, total sales excluding tobacco increased  $4.0\%$  reflecting stronger sales from its major banner group customers.

Food EBIT increased  $3.0\%$  to  $\$210.1$  million, reflecting the strong trading performance ex- tobacco, continued strong support from suppliers and the effective management of costs. The EBIT margin<sup>5</sup> increased 7 basis points to  $2.2\%$ , largely reflecting the change in sales mix associated with the decline in tobacco sales, as well as good cost management.

# Liquor

The Liquor pillar continued to outperform in a more challenging market with total sales (including charge-through<sup>1</sup>) increasing  $1.7\%$  to $5.2 billion, with growth in sales to independent retail and contract customers more than offsetting a decline in on-premise sales.

An increase in cost of living pressures continued to drive shopper focus on value, lower consumption and a decline in on-premise sales.

# DIRECTORS' REPORT CONTINUED

Wholesale sales to retail and contract customers increased  $2.2\%$  resulting in further market share gains. Sales growth was underpinned by continuation of the increased preference for localised offers, including convenience, tailored ranges, competitive prices and local friendly service. Sales to on-premise customers declined  $1.9\%$  in line with market trends, albeit some improvement was evident in the second half.

The highest growth categories were again RTDs and beer, with cost of living pressures driving shopper preference for lower priced value choices.

Liquor EBIT increased  $4.9\%$  to  $\$109.2$  million, reflecting the contribution from the business' strong trading performance, strategic buying and good cost management. The EBIT margin<sup>5</sup> increased 6 basis points to  $2.1\%$ .

# Hardware

The Hardware pillar delivered a pleasing result in the face of a rapid slowing in builder confidence and reduced market activity. Total Hardware sales (including charge-through\(^1\)) increased \(2.7\%\) to \(3.5\) billion, with growth in Total Tools sales more than offsetting a decline in IHG sales. On a like for like basis\(^6\), total Hardware sales declined \(2.7\%\). Total sales in the combined IHG and Total Tools retail networks were flat at \)4.5 billion.

The IHG business capitalised on the challenging conditions to outperform the softer addressable market through strong relationships with trade customers, the success of the Whole of House strategy and an improved DIY offer. Sales for the year were broadly flat at \(2.8 billion and declined \(3.0\%\) on a like for like basis. Scan sales for the IHG retail network<sup>7</sup> increased \(0.3\%\) (LfL \(-2.6\%\)) with DIY \(+2.7\%\) and Trade \(-1.0\%\).

In Total Tools, sales increased  $16.4\%$  to  $\$ 679.1$  million, largely reflecting the impact of new stores and additional majority- owned joint venture stores. On a like for like basis, sales declined  $1.3\%$ .

Retail network sales for Total Tools increased  $2.6\%$  to  $\$1,112.3$  million. On a like for like basis, sales declined  $2.3\%$  reflecting more challenging market conditions and intense pricing pressure in the market, particularly in the fourth quarter. Foot traffic was down in both the first and second half, but customer conversions increased, driven by Total Tools' competitiveness and leading market position. The pricing pressure had a short- term impact on Total Tools' gross margin as the business responded to protect market share. Margins normalised towards the end of the fourth quarter following more precise and strategic responses by Total Tools.

Hardware EBIT decreased  $3.8\%$  to  $210.9$  million, with both IHG and Total Tools delivering lower earnings compared to FY23. The year included a significant increase in regulatory costs (primarily in Victoria), higher labour and occupancy costs, and other cost inflation. On a like for like basis, Hardware EBIT declined  $11.0\%$ .

In IHG, EBIT decreased  $4.9\%$  to  $\$ 129.0$  million, reflecting the impact of lower sales volumes and additional costs. An increase in cost savings initiatives in the second half enabled the business to offset most of the additional costs and helped return the business to EBIT growth for the half.

In Total Tools, EBIT was $81.9 million, a decline of 1.9% or 11.5% on a like for like basis, and includes the one-off adverse impact associated with its transition to the new Ravenhall, Victoria distribution centre in the first half, and the increase in competitive intensity experienced in the fourth quarter. Total Tools EBIT margins continue to trend towards retail levels as the proportion of earnings from owned retail stores increases.

The Hardware EBIT margin<sup>5</sup> was  $6.1\%$  with IHG  $4.6\%$  and Total Tools  $12.1\%$ .

# Finance costs and tax

Net finance costs increased during the year driven by higher interest rates and the higher levels of debt associated with capital investment. Tax expense of $120.5 million on underlying profit represents an effective tax rate of 29.8% (FY23: 29.2%).

# Significant items

Significant items categories were consistent with the half-year and included Project Horizon implementation costs of  $20.6 million (FY23:$ 34.6 million), put option valuation and business acquisition costs (net) of $8.7 million (FY23: $30.0 million), Mega Distribution Centre transition costs of $2.6 million (FY23: $4.3 million) and impairment reversals of nil (FY23: impairment reversals of $9.3 million).

Group operating cash flows were  $482.6 million (FY23:$ 372.7 million), resulting in a strong cash realisation ratio of 102% (FY23: 77%) and reflecting a reduction in working capital.

The Group had net investing outflows (excluding sublease receipts) of  $328.4 million, including capital expenditure of$ 135.9 million and acquisitions of businesses of $205.6 million. The acquisitions of businesses were predominantly in the Hardware pillar and included the acquisition of Bianco Construction Supplies, Alpine Truss and an additional five Total Tools 'JV Stores'.

The Group also increased its ownership interest in Total Tools Holdings Pty Ltd from  $85\%$  to  $100\%$  and reset put option arrangements for 11 JV stores by acquiring additional ownership interests.

The Group raised $351.9 million of equity (net of transaction costs) during the year to fund the acquisition of Bianco Construction Supplies and Alpine Truss, both completed in March 2024 (refer Note 6.1) and the acquisition of Superior Foods which was subsequently completed on 3 June 2024.

The Group paid  $147.3 million (FY23:$ 217.2 million) in dividends during the current financial year, net of $66.4 million (FY23: Nil) reinvested in shares post activation of the Dividend Reinvestment Plan with effect from the FY23 final dividend. Total dividends paid in FY24 was 22.0 cents per share (FY23: 22.5 cents per share).

Net working capital decreased by  $19.9 million to$ 468.1 million reflecting the Group's continued strong focus on working capital management. Favourable management of inventory levels and customer collections over the fourth quarter helped offset the growth from the acquisition of businesses and the increase in sales.

Put option liabilities of $175.4 million predominantly relate to the Total Tools Group (refer note 5.3 of the financial report).

The Group was in a net debt position as at 30 April 2024 of  $251.9 million (FY23:$ 349.6 million) of which $150.0 million was hedged via interest rate swaps, with a weighted average hedge maturity of 1.3 years and a weighted average interest rate of 3.7%. The decrease in the Group's net debt position largely reflects the contribution from the equity raise. Metcash had $845.5 million in unused debt facilities and $97.3 million of cash and cash equivalents available at the reporting date for immediate use.

# Commitments, contingencies and other financial exposures

Put options, including in relation to Ritchies Stores Pty Ltd, are detailed along with other contingent liabilities in note 5.3 and note 7.3 of the financial statements.

Metcash has a moderate exposure to interest rate risk and minimal foreign exchange exposures. Further details are set out in note 5.6 of the financial statements.

# 6. OUTLOOK

Total Group sales for the first seven weeks of FY25 increased  $2.2\%$ , and were flat excluding Superior Foods which have been included in Metcash sales from the date of acquisition (3 June 2024).

Food (ex-tobacco) and Liquor have continued to perform strongly underpinned by their resilience and the continued successful execution of strategic initiatives.

Superior Foods is also performing strongly and winning new customers as expected.

# DIRECTORS' REPORT CONTINUED

The Hardware business is continuing to perform better than its softer addressable market, also demonstrating its resilience and the successful execution of initiatives. In professional tools, there are signs of some abatement to the intense pricing pressure seen in recent months.

The Company continues to have a strong focus on costs and working capital management and expects to deliver an additional $15 million of annualised cost savings in FY25.

Metcash is well positioned with the plans, platform, capabilities and diverse business portfolio for future growth and strong returns through the cycle.

# 7. MATERIAL BUSINESS RISKS

The following section outlines the material business risks that may impact on the Group achieving its strategic objectives and business operations, including the mitigating factors put in place to address those risks. The material risks are not set out in any particular order and exclude many general risks that could have a material effect on most businesses in Australia under normal operating conditions.

# Strategy and disruption risks

Consumer behaviour and preferences continue to change and are influenced by factors such as economic conditions, digital and technological development and disruption, healthy living trends, sustainability preferences and increasing choices in both online and in-store retail options.

While Metcash's business operations and strategic priorities are frequently reviewed and developed, and management regularly reviews Metcash's plans against market changes and modifies its approach (where necessary), such reviews and modifications may be ineffective in light of significantly changed conditions. For example, tobacco sales, which represent a significant proportion of the products Metcash supplies to its independent retailers, have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by healthy living trends, cost of living pressures and the prevalence and supply of illicit tobacco.

Metcash is continuing to invest in digital, expanding our capability and improving our delivery of digital solutions to our retailers and shoppers. This is being achieved through investment in our online stores, the expansion of the 'Sorted' platform, and improvements in loyalty offerings in Liquor.

Further, while Metcash is accelerating its investment in digital solutions, expanding its capability and improving the delivery of digital solutions to its retailers and shoppers, there is a risk that Metcash may experience project execution issues or may not realise the full benefits of these projects. There is also a risk that projects may experience scope variations, delays or cost overruns.

Accordingly, if the Group fails to adjust or execute its strategies to respond to changes in consumer behaviour and preferences, this may have a material adverse impact on the Group's financial performance and profitability. We seek to manage these risks through our Program Management Office and approach to project governance, including oversight by the Group Leadership Team and the Board.

# COVID-19 and pandemic risks

Although the World Health Organisation has declared an end to the COVID-19 public health emergency of international concern, Metcash has continued to experience some challenges influenced by COVID-19, including employee absenteeism, low to moderate levels of supply chain disruption, and workforce labour shortages. The Group's operations and those of our customers and suppliers could be impacted by COVID-19 through any reintroduction of restrictions such as social distancing, quarantines, travel or migration restrictions, work stoppages, health authority actions, lockdowns or other related measures. Any of these factors may adversely impact the Group's operational and financial performance.

# Competition risks

Any increase in competitive activity from new or existing competitors (including in the form of acquisitions by competitors of independent stores in our network, competitors soliciting customers to operate under non-Metcash banners, competitors engaging in price wars or competitive discount promotions, a new market entrant with a wholesaler model, where suppliers sell directly to the Group's customers, where customers form their own buying groups to collectively negotiate and purchase directly from suppliers or where indirect competitors change their business models to compete directly with the Group) may have a detrimental effect on the Group's operations, particularly if Metcash fails to respond effectively to that competitive activity or its response is delayed (for example, as a result of the time required to engage with the Group's independent retail network in order to implement an initiative). Increased competition may also adversely impact Metcash's long-term performance and profitability. We seek to manage this risk through the delivery of our strategic plan and execution of initiatives.

# Key brands risk

Metcash's success in generating profits and increasing its market share is based on the success of the key brands it owns or licences. Reliance on key brands makes Metcash vulnerable to brand damage from negative publicity, product tampering or recalls, unauthorised use of its brands or ineffective brand management by Metcash or its licensees, increasing the risk of asset write downs. We seek to manage this risk through contractual arrangements with licensees, trademark monitoring, and implementation of controls to manage private label product quality and safety.

In addition, Metcash does not own the IGA brand, but rather licences it from IGA, Inc. While IGA, Inc. may only terminate the licence agreement in limited circumstances (including for insolvency and material breach of the agreement), there is no guarantee that Metcash will continue to have the right to use the IGA brand in perpetuity.

# Macroeconomic and geopolitical risk

General macroeconomic conditions and factors including inflation, low levels of unemployment, monetary policy and variability in interest rates, changes in governments and their approach to fiscal policy including increasing taxes, levies and other imposts, variability in energy and input costs, cyclicality in building and construction markets, and changes in consumer purchasing behaviour may adversely impact our customers as well as Metcash's earnings, cost of doing business and profitability. For example, the increasing cost of living pressures may result in cost conscious consumers reducing purchases made at independent retailers or substituting such goods with purchases made at other perceived lower price retailers. Separately, the cost of housing and housing construction is subject to variations in building costs, materials and home-building capacity. Affordability of housing construction is impacted in addition by interest rates. Economic conditions may also impact the viability of some building and construction customers. These factors may have an impact on the hardware and tools parts of Metcash's business.

We seek to manage these risks through maintaining vigilance over our cost structure and delivering on our strategy to grow earnings and profitability.

Further, geopolitical tensions and actions of nation states, including trade wars, territorial disputes, incursions, and war may adversely impact Metcash's operations and supply chain, resulting in delivery delays or the unavailability of certain products or inputs, increased cost of doing business and subsequent impact on profitability. We seek to manage these risks through forecasting and planning to maintain adequate levels of supply, as well as understanding alternative avenues of supply.

# Operational risks

As a wholesaler, Metcash is reliant upon the success of its suppliers and retailers. Metcash continues to invest in programs to improve the health of the independent retail network and improving Metcash's infrastructure to make it simpler to do business. These programs aim to strengthen Metcash as the business partner of choice for both its suppliers and retailers. As with any significant change, there is a risk that these transformation programs fail to deliver the expected benefits, experience delays, scope variations or cost overruns. Metcash has strengthened its governance frameworks to manage these change programs through the establishment of dedicated project teams to ensure projects are delivered and risks are addressed in a timely manner.

Disruption to, or inefficiency or failure within Metcash's supply chain, product sourcing ability, or of key support systems could impact the Group's ability to deliver on its objectives, its operational capability and financial performance. We seek to manage this risk through the ongoing monitoring of our operations to ensure our supply chain and support systems are able to scale appropriately to respond to business needs.

# Compliance risks

Metcash's operations require compliance with various regulatory requirements including work health and safety, food and product safety, environmental, workplace industrial relations, public and product liability, modern slavery, privacy and security, financial, anti-money laundering, critical infrastructure and industry codes of conduct. Any regulatory breach could have a material negative impact on the operational performance, reputation or financial results of Metcash or its stakeholders. Non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations could expose Metcash to fines, penalties, investigations, liabilities and reputation impacts.

The Group has implemented internal processes and controls to manage and monitor compliance across areas including safety, security, sustainability, chain of responsibility, food safety and anti-money laundering. However, there is a risk that such internal processes may not be complied with. Further, Metcash has a strategy of driving growth by expanding through acquiring privately held retail stores as joint ventures. While Metcash will implement internal processes, as part of the operation of its joint ventures, to allow Metcash to monitor these joint venture stores, Metcash has less oversight over these stores compared to its corporate owned stores. Accordingly, compliance with Metcash's processes by joint venture stores and minority joint venture partners may be outside of Metcash's direct control and any such non-compliance may adversely affect Metcash's operational performance, reputation or financial results.

Metcash regularly assesses modern slavery risks in its supply chain as part of modern slavery reporting requirements. Any identification of such modern slavery risks could not only negatively impact Metcash's supply chain operations, but cause material reputational harm.

Further, the businesses of Metcash are highly regulated in many markets in which they sell their products. These regulations govern many parts of Metcash's operations, including the import, manufacturing, marketing, advertising, distribution and sales of its products. Examples of such regulation include industry codes of conduct, country of origin labelling laws, container deposit schemes and tobacco and liquor licensing, packaging and advertising laws. The products in a particular market could be subjected to changes or additions to existing regulations, which could increase the cost of goods or restrict Metcash's ability to sell or market products.

The introduction of new laws and regulations, or reform to existing structures, or increases in levies to fund government schemes and regulations, could materially impact Metcash's operational and financial performance, through increased expenditure on compliance and controls and any required adjustments to how we conduct business.

# Property and facilities risk

Metcash leases facilities for the wholesale distribution of grocery, fresh produce, liquor, hardware and other fast-moving consumer goods. Damage to or destruction of these facilities could result in the loss or reduction of distribution capability and hence adversely impact Metcash's financial results. While Metcash has in place insurances that it considers are sufficient for a business of its type and size, Metcash will be required to pay for the loss on any event up to the deductible and self-insurance retention.

# DIRECTORS' REPORT CONTINUED

# Financial risks

Competitive trading conditions and broader adverse economic conditions can increase the credit risk associated with the Group's activities, including the provision of credit and trading terms to its independent retailers.

Funding and liquidity risk continue to be relevant to the Group due to the need to adequately fund business operations, growth initiatives and absorb potential loss events that may arise. Inability to adequately fund the Group's business operations and growth plans may lead to difficulty in executing the Group's strategy. Metcash maintains a prudent approach towards capital management, which includes optimising working capital, disciplined capital expenditure, capital recycling and careful consideration of its dividend policy.

In an economic environment of high inflation and higher interest rates, Metcash may be impacted by increases in the cost of debt and potential instability in international banking markets. This could lead to a risk that the Group may be unable to refinance or renew its banking and debt facilities following expiry or will only be able to refinance or renew those facilities on terms that are less favourable to the Group than existing terms. Further, if Metcash failed to meet any of the covenants on its debt facilities there is a risk that the Group may be required to repay outstanding debt on notice or take other actions to remedy the breach.

Any requirement to repay outstanding debt on notice, or inability to refinance banking facilities or obtain capital or financing generally, on favourable terms or at all, may have a material adverse effect on the Group's financial performance and position.

We seek to manage these risks through maintaining diversity in our banking partners, the value and tenor of debt facilities we hold, including maintaining sufficient headroom, and managing our financial and operational performance to ensure ongoing compliance with debt covenants.

The Group's financial risk management framework is discussed in further detail in note 5.6 of the financial statements.

# Trading and customer risks

Metcash's ability to operate efficiently is critical to support independent retailers in remaining competitive. A disruption to the business could result in an increased cost to serve retailers and inability to meet customers' requirements.

In our Food pillar, Metcash services a number of large customers known as Multiple Store Owners (MSOs). These customers own and/or operate more than one independent retail store, and in some cases can own and/or operate a sizeable number of stores (examples of larger MSOs include Ritchies Stores Pty Ltd (Ritchies), Romeo Retail Group and Drakes Supermarkets). In addition, Metcash Food is a supplier to a number of contract customers, one of which is Australian United Retailers ('AURs'), which operates the Foodworks banned network. In 2022, Metcash entered into an agreement to supply AUR for a further five years commencing 1 July 2022.

Metcash also extended the term of its agreement to supply Drakes Supermarkets stores in Queensland for a further five years, to 3 June 2029. If any one or more MSOs or AURs were to materially reduce or cease to source their inventory from Metcash for any reason (including vertically integrating their supply chain, establishing an alternative buying group, purchasing from another source, entering into a supply agreement with a competitor or closure of stores due to insolvency or poor performance), this would adversely impact Metcash's long-term performance and profitability.

In addition, there are a number of large contract customers in the Liquor business whose contracts are renewed on a regular basis. If one or more of these contract customers decided not to renew their supply contract or the contract is renewed on less favourable terms, this could adversely impact Metcash's long-term performance and profitability.

Further, the Liquor and Total Tools businesses also have a number of large suppliers and if one or more of these suppliers decided to no longer conduct business with Metcash or supply is materially reduced (which could occur for a number of reasons), this too could adversely impact Metcash's long-term performance and profitability.

We seek to manage these risks by building and maintaining strong relationships with our retailers, helping our retailers to be the best store in their town, and striving to be our retailer's and supplier's business partner of choice; underpinned by an effective and efficient wholesale and logistics supply chain.

# Technology and cyber security risks

Metcash relies on a number of complex information technology systems to support its warehousing and distribution, supply chain, customer service, marketing and finance operations. A severe disruption to the information technology systems may significantly impact the operations and value of Metcash.

Metcash is undertaking a business transformation program called Program Horizon which will replace older technology, reducing operational risk and onerous maintenance costs. This program is subject to risk of execution, cost overruns and delays, which may adversely affect the Group's operations and may in turn affect its financial performance. Although Metcash has announced further strategies to de-risk the implementation of Program Horizon (including the completion of the build and subsequent deployment phases of the program being brought in-house and the extension of the deployment timeline to support a phased, lower-risk roll out strategy), there is a risk that such outcomes do not eventuate, resulting in cost overruns and further delays, which would adversely impact the Group's operations and financial performance.

Metcash has outsourced a number of functions in finance and IT to Tata Consulting Services ('TCS'), an Indian-based outsourcing provider. There is a risk that the provision of accounting and IT services could be disrupted through a failure at TCS due to a wide range of possibilities.

With expanding information privacy and security regulations, and an increasingly hostile cyber environment, Metcash recognises information privacy and cyber security as an increasing risk. Any impact on the availability, integrity or confidentiality of data could result in a breach of privacy and security regulations and/or impact Metcash's commercially sensitive information, which could expose Metcash to penalties (including financial penalties) and could adversely affect Metcash's operating and financial position or cause reputational harm. We seek to manage this risk through a suite of cyber and information security controls, including preventative and detective measures to manage exposure to cyber threats.

# Social responsibility, environment and climate change risks

Metcash is committed to 'Championing Successful Independents in support of Thriving Local Communities' and a key element of this is underpinned by ensuring its operations are conducted in a socially responsible manner.

Metcash has a moderate exposure to environmental risks. Metcash's operations could be impacted by natural disasters, extreme weather events or other catastrophic events which could materially disrupt its operations and supply chain. There is also a risk that, with time, the frequency and intensity of natural disasters and extreme weather events may increase if anthropogenic climate change accelerates or worsens.

Metcash is conscious of the impact its operations may have on the environment given the breadth of our operations across Australia. Although Metcash is only a moderate emitter of carbon emissions relative to its peers, we have set a science-based target to reduce our carbon emissions by  $42\%$  by 2030. In addition, Metcash seeks to reduce its environmental impact through programs and initiatives that manage its energy consumption and waste.

Metcash has a low to moderate exposure to social risks. Our business and our people are driven by our purpose of 'Championing Successful Independents in support of Thriving Local Communities', and Metcash is proud to support independent retailers who are at the heart of local communities across Australia. At the core of our Purpose and Vision are our Values – we believe that independence is worth fighting for; in treating our people, retailers and suppliers the way we like to be treated; and in giving back to the communities where we live and work.

Metcash contributes to our local communities through the IGA Community Chest Program, disaster relief, and through our partnership with Foodbank. In addition, Metcash maintains an unwavering commitment to supporting remote communities through its partnership with The Arnhem Land Progress Aboriginal Corporation (ALPA) and the Outback Stores in the Northern Territory, to deliver improved affordability of food supply and outcomes for those communities.

Metcash meets the threshold for reporting under the Modern Slavery Act 2018 (Cth) with our most recent statement available at modernslaveryregister.gov.au and our Anti-Slavery Policy is available on our website. Metcash is taking steps to continually improve its exposure to modern slavery risks in its supply chain.

For further information on how we manage climate, social responsibility and environmental risks please refer to our most recent Sustainability Report available on our website.

# Work health and safety risk

Metcash is focused on the safety of its staff and operations. While a strong emphasis is placed on the implementation of work, health and safety standards, the risk of serious injury, including psychosocial harm, or fatality remains. The occurrence of such events may have an adverse effect on the safety and wellbeing of our people and the productivity, operations and reputation of Metcash. We seek to manage this risk through our Safety, Health and Environment strategy and execution of initiatives to improve the safety and wellbeing of our people.

# People and culture risks

The increasing competitive landscape and low levels of unemployment continues to place pressure on the competition for talent and labour capacity and the ability to efficiently operate our business. The ability to attract and retain talent with the necessary skills and capabilities to operate in a challenging market whilst being able to effect transformation is critical to Metcash's success. Similarly, the ability to attract and retain employees to meet our labour and leadership capacity needs is crucial for our operational capability and efficiency. Metcash competes in labour markets to attract and retain its employees and management team. The competitive nature of these labour markets may result in the loss of key employees and/or labour capacity which may make it more difficult and costly to attract or retain employees. If Metcash is unable to attract and retain employees, this may adversely affect the Group's operations and overall financial performance.

Interruptions at Metcash's workplaces arising from industrial disputes, work stoppages and accidents may result in production losses and delays. Renegotiation of collective agreements may increase Metcash's operating costs and may involve disputes. We seek to manage these risks through ongoing engagement with our people and unions and implementing safety measures to minimise the likelihood and impact of accidents.

Metcash is committed to being a favourite place to work by unlocking the potential of its people through empowerment and ensuring the Group's cultural values align with their values. Integrity is the foundation of the ethical values and standards of behaviour set for all employees through the Group's Code of Conduct.

Metcash invests in its people through training and development opportunities, by promoting diversity and workplace flexibility and maintaining succession planning. The short and long-term incentive schemes align the Group's remuneration structure to shareholders' interests.

# DIRECTORS' REPORT CONTINUED

# Ritchies put option - contingent liability

Metcash has a  $29.9\%$  ownership interest in Ritchies Stores Pty Ltd (Ritchies). The remaining shareholders in Ritchies have the right to put their  $70.1\%$  ownership interests to Metcash, subject to a margin related annual financial hurdle ('hurdle') being achieved.

Metcash estimates that the put option consideration payable to Ritchies shareholders in respect of Ritchies' 2023 financial year would have been between  $255 million and$ 265 million. Further details regarding the put option are set out in Note 5.3 of the Financial Report.

If the put option was exercised, it may divert funds from other intended uses of such funds, which may initially have an adverse impact on Metcash pursuing various capital investments and may require Metcash to obtain additional funding through debt or equity or a combination.

# Investigations, disputes and litigation

The Group may, from time to time, be subject to regulatory reviews, audits and investigations which divert management's attention away from the Group's operations and may be costly. There is a risk that enforcement action may follow any regulatory review, audit or investigation and that such activities also adversely affect Metcash's reputation.

Exposure to disputes or litigation with third parties such as regulators (for example, the ACCC and AUSTRAC), employees, business associates, customers and suppliers (including as to the terms of supply arrangements), the holders of rental guarantees granted by Metcash (including where the guarantee is called on), contract counterparties (including in the context of business or share acquisition agreements) or other third parties (including in the context of historical and future acquisitions) could negatively impact on Metcash's financial performance through increased costs, settlement payments, concessions made in contract negotiations, damages payments and reputational damage.

During the financial year, the Company has paid, or agreed to pay, a premium in respect of a contract of insurance insuring officers (and any persons who are officers in the future) against certain liabilities incurred in that capacity. Disclosure of the total amount of the premiums and the nature of the liabilities in respect of such insurance is prohibited by the contract of insurance.

(a) The Safety and Sustainability Committee was established on 1 May 2023. Ms Holman was appointed Chair of this Committee from 1 May 2023.

Each Board meeting generally runs for 1.5 days, while each Committee meeting generally runs for half a day.

In addition, the Board and Group Leadership Team hold a half day strategy and/or professional development session before three Board meetings each year, as well as a 2-day strategy session each October. The Board also holds regular calls with the Group CEO to stay abreast of current matters between meetings. Finally, from time to time, additional non-standing Board committees or working groups are established with representatives from among the Directors to consider material transactions or projects, including to support the decision-making of the full Board in relation to those matters. In FY24, for example, a Board committee was established to provide additional Board oversight and guidance of the execution of the equity raise announced on 5 February 2024. These strategy/professional development sessions, update calls and working group/steering committee meetings (with the exception of the Technology Advisory Working Group) are not included in the above table.

# REMUNERATION REPORT

On behalf of the Board and the People, Culture & Nomination Committee, I am pleased to present our Remuneration Report for the year ended 30 April 2024

# MARGARET HASELTINE

Chair, People, Culture & Nomination Committee

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/0c5583bd-e43c-4059-9d30-f0f24e0016e2/8ea47be602e8dc02f8d05ddb2c550bfae5f5eedce99518a9beaad6532f535050.jpg)

It is pleasing to report that the Group delivered solid and above market consensus earnings during a period of increasingly challenging economic conditions. Both the Food and Liquor pillars continued to perform well, underpinned by strong sales (non-tobacco) and sound cost management. In Hardware, a further deterioration in external conditions weighed on the overall performance of the pillar. Strategically, further progress was made with the Group continuing its transformation into a more diversified, resilient and high-quality business.

# Leadership changes

During FY24, there were some notable changes within the Metcash executive team. As previously advised, Mr Alistair Bell, the former Group CFO, retired from the role and agreed to stay on until February 2024 to facilitate the transition to the incoming Group CFO, Ms Deepa Sita, who also took on responsibility for the Group Strategy function. Mr Chris Baddock, the former CEO ALM, retired from the role for health reasons and we welcomed Ms Kylie Wallbridge as CEO ALM in March 2024. The year also included the appointment of Mr Richard Murray in January 2024 to succeed Paul Dumbrell as CEO of our Total Tools business.

The diversity in background and experience of the newly appointed executives highlights the comprehensive nature of the searches undertaken in finding the right calibre of executive to form part of our leadership team and make a difference in 'Championing Successful Independents in support of Thriving Local Communities'.

# FY24 remuneration framework changes

Last year we flagged a change in the deferred proportion of any Short-term Incentive (STI) awards to be paid to the Group CEO and Group CFO. The STI deferral percentage for the Group CEO increased this year from  $33\%$  to  $40\%$  and will increase again in FY25 to  $50\%$ . Similarly, the STI deferral percentage for the Group CFO increased from  $25\%$  to  $33\%$  this year, with further increases in FY25 to  $40\%$  and in FY26 to  $50\%$ . This enhances alignment to market practice and shareholder expectations.

For FY24, we have increased the Long-term Incentive (LTI) opportunity of the Group CEO from  $80\%$  of fixed remuneration to  $90\%$  to enhance alignment with shareholders. In FY25, the Group CEO LTI opportunity will be further increased to reflect a higher weighting towards the longer-term.

The Board has also reviewed the approach for determining Group underlying earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) for remuneration purposes. From FY24, Group Adjusted EBIT, which includes Project Horizon and Mega Distribution Centre transition costs, will be used in both the STI plan and to determine ROFE in the LTI plan. This change ensures that financial performance for remuneration purposes takes into account the costs of these significant projects.

The Balanced Scorecard to determine FY24 performance has also been refined, with all executives sharing Group Financial and Strategic objectives (weighted  $70\%$ ) to ensure there is an increased collective focus and accountability on Group objectives. Each executive also has Individual Strategic objectives specific to their role (weighted  $30\%$ ) to drive business specific performance and differentiate performance.

# FY24 performance

Group Adjusted EBIT improved by  $2.4\%$  on FY23, reflecting strong results in Food and Liquor as well as lower Project Horizon costs. The Group Performance Scorecard outcomes are highlighted in the summary table on the following page and compare positively with FY23, reflective of the strong overall performance of the Group in a challenging year.

# FY24 remuneration outcomes

# Fixed remuneration

To continue to attract and retain high-calibre executives, careful consideration is given to market benchmarks, internal relativities and executive experience when establishing or adjusting fixed remuneration. Metcash continues to position remuneration around the market median but with capacity to move towards the upper quartile for deeply experienced or high-performing executives.

The fixed remuneration component for two of our executives was increased in the year to ensure remuneration reflected their deep level of role experience relative to the market benchmarks. The CEO IHG and the former CEO ALM were provided with an  $8.3\%$  and  $4.2\%$  increase respectively. The fixed remuneration of the new incoming executives was determined with reference to market benchmarks, their respective levels of experience, and the internal relativities across the executive team.

# Short-term Incentives

The STI awards for executives are determined by Group and pillar financial performance and outcomes against the Balanced Scorecard, comprising both Group and Individual objectives. The FY24 STI awards for continuing executives ranged from  $14.6\%$  to  $38.1\%$  of maximum. In the context of an increasingly challenging market, and the stretch targets set in the FY24 Balanced Scorecard, the Board considers that these STI outcomes both align with overall performance and reflect the underlying strength of the business.

# Long-term Incentives

The FY22 LTI offer was tested at the end of FY24 with an outcome of  $76.7\%$ . The average Return on Funds Employed over the three-year performance period was  $28.8\%$ , above the maximum of the vesting range. The compound annual growth of absolute Total Shareholder Return was  $7.5\%$  over the same period, between the target and maximum of the vesting range. This outcome aligns with the experience of shareholders over that period.

Further details on the performance and remuneration outcomes for FY24 are provided in the table on the following page, for reference.

# Additional remuneration arrangements

The second tranche of the Group CEO's buy-out grant was tested during the year and subsequently vested at  $100\%$  based upon the performance conditions.

The incoming Group CFO, Ms Deepa Sita, was provided with a buy-out grant in consideration of incentives forfeited from her previous employer. The details of this are provided in Section 4.7.

# Non-executive Director fees

During the year, in consideration of the growing time commitments and workloads of Board and Committee members, and with reference to FY24 market benchmarks, the following fees were increased for Non-executive Directors, effective from 1 May 2023:

- The Board Member (excluding the Chair) fee increased by \(3.8\%\) to \\(167,595;  
- The Chair fee for both the Audit, Risk & Compliance Committee (ARCC) and the People, Culture & Nomination Committee (PCNC) increased by  $20.1\%$  to  $\$46,350$ ; and  
- The Member fee for both the ARCC and PCNC increased by  $30.5\%$  to $22,660.

The Safety & Sustainability Committee was established on 1 May 2023 with fees aligned with the Technology Advisory Working Group. Board and Committee fees are provided in Section 7.

# Looking ahead to FY25

Following a review in FY24, the Board appointed PwC to undertake market benchmarking for both executive remuneration and Nonexecutive Director fees. The Board determined to take a refined approach, with market data based on similar roles within two peer groups of comparable companies, focusing on market capitalisation and industry. The Board believes that the new approach is both fit-for-purpose and aligned with market practice. Further details are provided in Section 3.1.

The refined market benchmarks for both executive remuneration and Non-executive Director fees are lower than under the previous methodology and the Board will continue to consider the market data to inform decisions when determining appropriate remuneration. In consideration of Non-executive Director fee increases implemented in FY24, and the refined market benchmarks, the Board has determined that no fee increases will be implemented in FY25.

During FY25, the Board will review the remuneration framework to ensure that the remuneration mix and performance metrics align with the longer-term strategic objectives of the Group and continue to create shareholder value.

We hope you find this Report informative and, as usual, we welcome any feedback on our remuneration framework and disclosures.

# FY24 Remuneration Outcomes Summary

<table><tr><td>Fixed remuneration</td><td>During the year, the fixed remuneration for two executives was increased. Ms Annette Welsh, the CEO IHG, was provided with an 8.3% increase in fixed remuneration and Mr Chris Baddock, the former CEO ALM, was provided with an increase in fixed remuneration of 4.2% to ensure their remuneration reflected their experience in their respective roles relative to market benchmarks.
The fixed remuneration of incoming executives was established in consideration of market benchmarks and the relative experience of each executive.
It is Metcash&#x27;s approach to position remuneration around the market median with capacity to move towards the upper quartile for deeply experienced or high-performing incumbents to ensure we are able to attract and retain the calibre of executives required to drive the overall Metcash strategy.</td></tr><tr><td>Short-term incentive outcomes</td><td>Group STI Pool Metric
Group Adjusted EBIT: Improved by 2.4% ($11.2 million) on FY23, reflecting strong results in Food and Liquor as well as lower Project Horizon costs.
Group Performance Scorecard Metrics
Group revenue (excluding tobacco): Improved by 3.2% on FY23, reflecting growth across all pillars.
Safety: The Group Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) outcome of 14.3 was an improvement of 22.3% on FY23 (18.4¹), an indicator that the ongoing focus on safety is keeping our people safe.
Employee engagement: An increase of one percentage point across all Metcash employees was below target for FY24 but a positive outcome in the context of the changes across the organisation and leadership team.
Net Promoter Score: An outcome of 17 was below the FY23 score of 21.1 across the Group. All pillars had positive NPS scores for FY24, with Hardware and Liquor the strongest performers.
Sustainability: The waste-to-landfill diversion outcome was above target at 65.9%, up from 61% in FY23.
Project Horizon: Progressed on track and on budget against the FY24 plan. The overall spend has been curtailed to reflect the extended build and deployment schedule, while risk management and quality assurance continue to be prioritised.
Overall STI Outcomes
These performance outcomes resulted in STI awards of between 14.6% to 38.1% of maximum for continuing executives. The Board considered that this was appropriate and aligned with the overall performance of the Group in FY24.</td></tr><tr><td>Long-term incentive outcomes</td><td>The FY22 LTI offer was tested as at 30 April 2024 with the following outcomes:
- Return on Funds Employed (ROFE): 28.8% average over the three-year period, resulting in 100% of performance rights subject to that performance measure vesting; and
- Absolute Total Shareholder Return (ATSR): 7.5% compound annual growth over the three-year period resulting in 53.4% of performance rights subject to that performance measure vesting.
Overall outcome: 76.7% of performance rights under the FY22 LTI offer vested. The Board considers that this outcome is reflective of Group performance over the three-year period and that it aligns with the experience of shareholders over that time.</td></tr></table>

1. A re-classification of injury types was undertaken during FY24 to align with industry definitions. The FY23 outcome was 18.4 based on the new classifications, compared to 19.9 disclosed last year using the prior classifications.

# 2.2. Our Remuneration Framework

The framework is designed to drive the delivery of our strategy.

<table><tr><td>Component:</td><td>Fixed Remuneration</td><td>Short-term Incentive (STI)</td><td>Long-term Incentive (LTI)</td></tr><tr><td>Purpose:</td><td>To attract and retain the calibre of people required to deliver the strategy.</td><td>To align the potential rewards for Executives with the performance of Metcash.</td><td>To align the potential rewards for Executives with the experience of shareholders.</td></tr><tr><td>Delivery:</td><td>Salary, superannuation, and salary sacrificed benefits.</td><td>A combination of cash and deferred equity.</td><td>Performance Rights.</td></tr><tr><td>Determined by:</td><td>Fixed remuneration is established at a level that is competitive in the market, with reference to comparable roles at similarly sized companies.
Fixed remuneration is generally positioned around the median, however our framework also enables the recognition of deeply experienced, high-performing individuals.</td><td>12-month performance period. STI pool is distributed when threshold financial performance is met and scaled based on performance up to a prescribed maximum.
Performance is then assessed against a scorecard of Group financial and strategic objectives (70%) and individual strategic objectives (30%). Outcomes are modified by a behavioural rating.</td><td>Three-year performance period.
Performance is assessed against Return on Funds Employed (ROFE) (50%) and Absolute Total Shareholder Return (TSR) (50%).</td></tr></table>

# 2.3. Our Remuneration Mix

The remuneration mix is strongly weighted towards the variable reward components of STI and LTI, and therefore subject to performance outcomes. The chart below outlines the FY24 remuneration mix framework for Executives, including target and maximum STI and LTI opportunity.

# 3. FY24 REMUNERATION APPROACH

3.1. Fixed Remuneration  

<table><tr><td>Feature</td><td>Description</td></tr><tr><td>Purpose</td><td>The purpose of fixed remuneration is to attract and retain Executives of the calibre to deliver on the Metcash strategy.</td></tr><tr><td>Delivery</td><td>Salary, superannuation, and salary sacrificed benefits.</td></tr><tr><td>Benchmarking</td><td>Metcash undertakes an annual benchmarking exercise to review the fixed remuneration of current Executives. As part of this review, Metcash considers the competitiveness of fixed remuneration levels in the context of the Executive&#x27;s experience and performance.
Market data is collated by an external remuneration advisor based upon companies of comparable size and industry. Previously, peer groups have been established with reference to market capitalisation, revenue, total assets and industry to reflect the complexity of the environment in which Metcash operates. From FY25, a refined approach has been adopted referencing two peer groups to be used for benchmarking purposes: the first is determined by company size and includes ASX 200 companies that are similarly sized to Metcash, based upon market capitalisation; the second includes similarly sized companies within a comparable industry. Remuneration benchmarking considers total remuneration in addition to fixed remuneration.
It is Metcash&#x27;s policy to position remuneration at the median with scope to move towards the upper quartile in recognition of deeply experienced, high-performing individuals.</td></tr></table>

3.2. Short-term Incentive plan  

<table><tr><td>Feature</td><td>Description</td></tr><tr><td>Purpose</td><td>The ‘at-risk’ STI plan provides Executives the opportunity to earn an incentive that is contingent upon performance against a combination of agreed financial and non-financial performance targets, which are set by the Board in consultation with the Group CEO at the start of each financial year.</td></tr><tr><td>Delivery</td><td>Delivered in a combination of cash and deferred equity (40% for the Group CEO; 33% for the Group CFO and 25% for other Executives).Deferred equity comprises performance rights that convert into fully paid ordinary shares in Metcash, which only become unrestricted at the end of the deferral period.</td></tr><tr><td>Performance period</td><td>1 May each year to 30 April the following year.</td></tr><tr><td>Eligibility</td><td>All Executives participate in the STI plan.The Group CEO and Group CFO participate in the Group STI pool which is determined by the Group’s Adjusted EBIT. Group Adjusted EBIT represents consolidated Group underlying EBIT adjusted to include Project Horizon and Mega Distribution transition costs (&#x27;Group Adjusted EBIT&#x27;). The pillar CEOs participate in their respective pillar STI pools which are determined by a combination of their respective pillar EBIT and Group Adjusted EBIT.</td></tr></table>

STI opportunities The FY24 STI opportunities as a percentage of fixed remuneration for Executives are outlined below:  

<table><tr><td rowspan="3"></td><td>Position</td><td>Below threshold % of fixed</td><td>Threshold % of fixed</td><td>Target % of fixed</td><td>Maximum % of fixed</td></tr><tr><td>Group CEO</td><td>0%</td><td>17.5%</td><td>70.0%</td><td>157.5%</td></tr><tr><td>Other Executives</td><td>0%</td><td>15.0%</td><td>60.0%</td><td>135.0%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="6">Performance measures</td><td colspan="5">The Group Adjusted EBIT or pillar underlying EBIT acts as a ‘gate opener’ for the STI pools from which awards are paid. The STI pools are only released for distribution when the threshold Group Adjusted EBIT or pillar underlying EBIT budget result, as applicable, is achieved. The STI pools are generally made available for distribution on the following basis:</td></tr><tr><td>Achievement</td><td></td><td>Distribution of STI pool</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Below threshold 95% of budget EBIT</td><td></td><td>0% - no pool is available for distribution</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Threshold 95% of budget EBIT</td><td></td><td>50% of the respective STI pools</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Budget or ‘Target’ EBIT</td><td></td><td>100% of the respective STI pools</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Over-achievement &gt;=105% of budget EBIT</td><td></td><td>150% of the respective STI pools</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>

Once an STI pool is released for distribution and scaled as noted above, a participant's individual STI award is determined based on individual performance, as determined through a Balanced Scorecard, and behaviours. An individual's overall performance rating is equally weighted between their scorecard results and Metcash behaviours. The Balanced Scorecard is established at the start of the financial year and includes a combination of financial and non-financial performance measures. A number of these performance measures are aligned to Group strategy (Group objectives), with additional individual performance measures, which vary for each Executive, aligning with the strategies for their respective pillars (Individual objectives). Details of the FY24 performance measures and targets are provided in Section 4.3.

# DIRECTORS' REPORT CONTINUED

<table><tr><td>Feature</td><td colspan="5">Description</td></tr><tr><td>Target setting</td><td colspan="5">Challenging performance targets are set against each performance measure following a rigorous budget setting process that considers many factors, including market conditions. This process includes draft budgets being prepared by leadership teams with pillar CEO and CFO reviews and subsequently Group CEO and CFO reviews. The Board then reviews the draft budgets to ensure that they are both sufficiently challenging and achievable.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="6">Performance Assessment</td><td colspan="5">The People, Culture &amp; Nomination Committee (PCNC) assesses the outcomes against the performance measures for all Executives. Behavioural ratings act to modify performance outcomes against scorecard objectives and can result in an increase for exceptional behaviour, a decrease for unacceptable behaviour or no change for successful behaviours in the overall performance rating.
Our Metcash Behaviours are:</td></tr><tr><td>Accountability</td><td>Continuous Improvement</td><td>Team Work</td><td colspan="2">Think Customer</td></tr><tr><td>I am open and honest, accepting responsibility and delivering on promises. I act with integrity.</td><td>I learn from success and failure and seek out a better way and collaborate with others to reach the best outcome.</td><td>I am responsible for the strength and diversity of my team, and I own my development. I build a strong culture.</td><td colspan="2">I understand and anticipate my customer / retailer / supplier / shopper needs and drive innovation for mutual benefit.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5">An individual&#x27;s STI award is calculated on the following basis:</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed remuneration</td><td>STI target %</td><td>Group/Pillar EBIT outcome (0-150%)</td><td>Balanced Scorecard outcome (0-150%)</td><td>Individual STI award</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5">When determining STI outcomes, the PCNC uses its judgement to ensure that the awards align to overall business performance in addition to shareholder and other stakeholder expectations. The PCNC makes a recommendation to the Board on the STI awards to be made to Executives for final approval.
The maximum reward is only paid on achievement of &#x27;stretch&#x27; outcomes, which include:
- Maximum achievement against Group Adjusted EBIT and/or pillar underlying EBIT financial performance hurdles, as applicable (STI pool);
- Maximum achievement in overall individual performance results against all Group financial and non-financial measures together with achievement of individual objectives contained in the Balanced Scorecard; and
- An exceptional or successful rating against Metcash&#x27;s behaviours framework.</td></tr><tr><td>Deferred vesting criteria</td><td colspan="5">The deferred performance rights are conditional and only vest if the Executive remains employed by the Company up to and including a specified date in the year following the performance period. Prior to the FY24 STI awards, this date was in April in the following year with shares restricted from trading until the release of the annual results, typically in late June. With effect from FY24, the conditional vesting period for any deferred performance rights will be extended to early July following the release of the Group&#x27;s annual results, typically in late June.</td></tr><tr><td>Deferred awards calculation</td><td colspan="5">The number of performance rights issued to participants is calculated by dividing the value of the STI award to be deferred by the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of Metcash ordinary shares over the 20 trading days prior to the end of the performance period which ends on 30 April.</td></tr><tr><td>Board discretion</td><td colspan="5">The Board may exercise discretion to adjust the STI pool to more appropriately reflect the performance of the Group or a specific pillar. The Board also retain discretion to adjust vesting outcomes in any circumstances to ensure they are appropriate.</td></tr><tr><td>Clawback</td><td colspan="5">Executive STI awards are subject to clawback for cause or material misstatement of the Group&#x27;s financial statements.</td></tr></table>

1. Group Adjusted EBIT represents the Group Underlying EBIT adjusted to include Project Horizon and Mega DC transition costs. The FY24 STI pool is based on the Group Adjusted EBIT (FY20 to FY23: based on Group Underlying EBIT).  
2. With effect from the FY24 LTI offer, ROFE is calculated as Group Adjusted EBIT divided by the average of funds employed at the beginning and end of the financial year (previously, based on Group Underlying EBIT divided by the average of funds employed at the beginning and end of the financial year).

Other Group performance metrics over the last five years were as follows:

<table><tr><td>Financial year</td><td>FY20</td><td>FY21</td><td>FY22</td><td>FY23</td><td>FY24</td></tr><tr><td>Revenue ($b)</td><td>13.0</td><td>14.3</td><td>15.2</td><td>15.8</td><td>15.9</td></tr><tr><td>Cash realisation ratio (%)</td><td>33%</td><td>114%</td><td>91%</td><td>77%</td><td>102%</td></tr><tr><td>Dividends declared per share (cents)</td><td>12.5</td><td>17.5</td><td>21.5</td><td>22.5</td><td>19.5</td></tr><tr><td>Closing share price (as at 30 April) ($)</td><td>2.49</td><td>3.55</td><td>4.79</td><td>3.90</td><td>3.94</td></tr><tr><td>Total STI payments to Executives as a % of maximum</td><td>43.0%</td><td>84.1%</td><td>78.1%</td><td>79.6%</td><td>33.8%</td></tr></table>

In FY24, the Group delivered solid and above market consensus earnings despite increasingly challenging economic conditions. Overall, however, the Metcash Group STI outcome was below target. Both the Food and Liquor pillars delivered above target EBIT results reflecting strong sales and sound cost management. The Hardware pillar delivered results above market consensus, but below target EBIT, with construction activity softening further during the year. IHG's EBIT was below target despite delivering market share gains and performing better than the market overall. Total Tools' EBIT was below threshold reflecting more challenging external conditions. Efficiency measures have been introduced in both IHG and Total Tools to help address the impact of the external conditions. The STI outcomes for continuing Executives range between  $14.6\%$  to  $38.1\%$  of maximum.

In FY23, the Group and the pillars delivered strong EBIT results. The pillars delivered EBIT results at 'maximum'/'above target' levels with Group EBIT increasing  $6.0\%$  on FY22 outcomes. Accordingly, the STI outcomes awarded to Executives ranged from  $65\%$  to  $84\%$  of maximum.

In FY22, the Group and the pillars delivered exceptional EBIT results. All pillars delivered EBIT results above the 'maximum' level with Group EBIT increasing  $17.7\%$  on FY21 outcomes. Accordingly, the STI outcomes awarded to Executives ranged from  $73\%$  to  $85\%$  of maximum.

In FY21, the Group and the pillars performed exceptionally well, delivering EBIT results against already stretching targets at a  $19.9\%$  increase on FY20 outcomes in extremely challenging circumstances.

In FY20, whilst the Group and the Food pillar delivered strong EBIT results, the Board exercised its discretion to reduce the overall STI award to the 'on target' level. The Liquor pillar was determined to have performed 'on target' and the Hardware pillar 'below target'.

1. Represents the cash component of the FY24 STI reward amount of  $60\%$  (Group CEO),  $67\%$  (Group CFO) and  $75\%$  (other Executives) payable in cash in July 2024. The deferred equity component of the FY24 STI reward of  $40\%$  (Group CEO),  $33\%$  (Group CFO) and  $25\%$  (other Executives) is not presented above because the reward is conditional upon the executive being employed by the Company on 3 July 2025.  
2. Represents the deferred equity component of the FY23 STI reward of  $33\%$  (Group CEO) and  $25\%$  (other Executives) which were deferred as equity. The Executives have subsequently met the continuity of employment service condition. Accordingly, the performance rights have vested and will be allocated as shares following the share trading restriction period that ends 25 June 2024. The amounts presented above are based on the number of rights vested multiplied by the VWAP of Metcash shares over the 20 business days ending 30 April 2023 of $3.94 per share.  
3. The FY22-FY24 LTI will vest at  $76.7\%$ , subject only to the Executives remaining in employment until 15 August 2024. The amounts presented above are based on the number of rights that will vest multiplied by the VWAP of Metcash shares over the 20 business days until 30 April 2024 of $3.91 per share.

# 4.2. FY24 Fixed remuneration outcomes

During the year, the fixed remuneration for two Executives was increased. Ms Annette Welsh, the CEO IHG, was provided with an  $8.3\%$  increase in fixed remuneration and Mr Chris Baddock, the former CEO ALM, was provided with an increase in fixed remuneration of  $4.2\%$  to ensure their remuneration reflected their experience in their respective roles relative to market benchmarks.

The fixed remuneration of incoming Executives was established in consideration of market benchmarks and the relative experience of each Executive.

It is Metcash's approach to position remuneration around the market median with capacity to move towards the upper quartile for deeply experienced or high-performing incumbents to ensure we are able to attract and retain the calibre of executives required to drive the overall Metcash strategy.

# 4.3. FY24 STI outcomes

Whilst the FY24 Group STI pool outcome was below target, Group Adjusted EBIT improved by  $2.4\%$  (\$11.2 million) on FY23, reflecting strong results in Food and Liquor as well as lower Project Horizon costs. Further details are provided in the introduction to Section 4.

The Balanced Scorecard outcomes against the Financial, Strategic and Individual objectives are shown on the following page. Group revenue (excluding tobacco) improved by  $3.2\%$  on FY23, reflecting growth across all pillars. The Group revenue scorecard outcome was, however, rated at below target for FY24.

There were strong scorecard outcomes across Safety (TRIFR), achieving stretch target, and Sustainable growth (waste-to-landfill diversion), at above target. Employee engagement improved by one percentage point across all Metcash employees but was below target for FY24. Whilst the Net Promoter Score was below threshold, all pillars delivered positive outcomes.

As outlined in Section 3.2, FY24 STI awards for Executives are determined by Group and/or pillar EBIT, Balanced Scorecard outcomes, and also informed by an assessment of behaviours. The FY24 STI awards for continuing Executives range from  $14.6\%$  to  $38.1\%$  of maximum which the Board considers is appropriate and aligns with performance of the Group over the financial year.

The FY24 Balanced Scorecard, weighted  $70\%$  against Group objectives and  $30\%$  against Individual objectives, is summarised below:

<table><tr><td></td><td colspan="6">FY24 Balanced Scorecard</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Measure</td><td>Threshold</td><td>Target</td><td>Stretch</td><td colspan="2">Actual Outcome</td></tr><tr><td>Group Objectives:</td><td>Sales revenue (excl. tobacco)</td><td>- 2.8%</td><td>$16.2 billion</td><td>+ 2.8%</td><td>$15.8 billion</td><td>Above threshold</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Financial &amp; Value Creation (35%)</td><td>Net working capital</td><td>+ 10%</td><td>14 days</td><td>- 10%</td><td>14.4 days</td><td>Above threshold</td></tr><tr><td>Project Horizon</td><td>Varied</td><td>Delivery of key milestones</td><td>Varied</td><td>90% of targets</td><td>Above threshold</td></tr><tr><td>Group Objectives:</td><td>Sustainable growth: Waste diversion from landfill (FY23 = 61%)</td><td>- 4%</td><td>63%</td><td>+ 4%</td><td>65.9%</td><td>Above target</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">Strategic (35%)</td><td>Safety: TRIFR% (FY23 = 18.4)1</td><td>18.2</td><td>16.5</td><td>14.9</td><td>14.3</td><td>Stretch</td></tr><tr><td>Employee Engagement</td><td>FY23 outcome</td><td>+ 4 percentage pts</td><td>+ 8 percentage pts</td><td>+ 1 percentage pts</td><td>Above threshold</td></tr><tr><td>Customer NPS (FY23 = 21.1)</td><td>21.1</td><td>27.0</td><td>32.8</td><td>17.0</td><td>Below threshold</td></tr><tr><td>Individual Objectives (30%)</td><td colspan="6">Objectives are commercially sensitive and align with the strategies of the Group and pillars.

1. A re-classification of injury types was undertaken during FY24 to align with industry definitions. The FY23 outcome was 18.4 based on the new classifications, compared to 19.9 disclosed last year using the prior classifications.

The table below outlines the Group and Individual objective outcomes and how the FY24 STI awards are determined:

2. The retirement of the former Group CFO, Mr Alistair Bell, was announced in December 2022. Mr Bell agreed to stay on with Metcash until February 2024, following the commencement of Ms Sita in the role to ensure a smooth transition. The pro-rated STI award to Mr Bell recognises his ongoing commitment to Metcash and his contribution to finalising the strategic acquisitions during FY24. Mr Bell was not provided with an FY24 LTI offer.  
1. The cash component of the FY24 STI reward of  $60\%$  (Group CEO),  $67\%$  (Group CFO) and  $75\%$  (other Executives) is payable in cash in July 2024.

2. The deferred equity component of the FY24 STI reward of  $40\%$  (Group CEO),  $33\%$  (Group CFO) and  $25\%$  (other Executives) is deferred and released through the issue of Metcash performance rights, conditional upon the executive being employed by the Company on 3 July 2025 or in accordance with separation arrangements.

# 4.4. FY23 STI deferred equity outcomes

The following table presents the vesting of the FY23 STI deferred equity component, following completion of the employment service condition or in accordance with separation arrangements:

<table><tr><td>Participant</td><td>Vesting date</td><td>No. of rights held</td><td>No. of rights vested</td><td>No. of rights forfeited</td></tr><tr><td>D Jones</td><td>30 April 2024</td><td>193,455</td><td>193,455</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>A Welsh</td><td>30 April 2024</td><td>45,786</td><td>45,786</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>A Bell</td><td>30 April 2024</td><td>57,391</td><td>57,391</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>C Baddock</td><td>30 April 2024</td><td>41,148</td><td>41,148</td><td>—</td></tr></table>

The number of performance rights were calculated by dividing  $33\%$  (Group CEO) and  $25\%$  (other Executives) of the FY23 STI award dollar value by the VWAP of Metcash ordinary shares over the 20 trading days ended 30 April 2023 of $3.94 per share. The FY23 STI deferred equity component subsequently vested on 30 April 2024 following the Executive's completion of the service condition or in accordance with separation arrangements. These performance rights will be allocated as shares following the share trading restriction period that ends on 25 June 2024.

# 4.5. FY24 LTI outcomes

# FY22-FY24 LTI grant

The plan is expected to vest on 15 August 2024 at  $76.7\%$  subject only to the active participants remaining in employment until that date. The FY22-FY24 LTI grant vesting results are set out below:

<table><tr><td>Performance measure</td><td>Weighting</td><td>Performance result</td><td>Vesting result (%)</td></tr><tr><td>ROFE</td><td>50%</td><td>ROFE performance over the three-year plan period was 28.8%</td><td>100%</td></tr><tr><td>ATSR</td><td>50%</td><td>ATSR CAGR performance over the three-year plan period was 7.5%</td><td>53.4%</td></tr></table>

The ROFE vesting scale ranged from  $23\%$  (threshold  $25\%$  vesting) to  $26\%$  (maximum  $100\%$  vesting). The TSR vesting scale ranged from  $6\%$  CAGR (threshold  $25\%$  vesting) to  $10\%$  CAGR (maximum  $100\%$  vesting). Vesting occurs on a straight-line basis between each hurdle, with nil vesting below threshold. Full vesting only occurs if Metcash achieves a ROFE of greater than  $26\%$  and TSR CAGR of greater than  $10\%$  over the performance period.

The Board applied their customary diligence when performance testing this LTI grant and ensured that all significant items were prudently considered, before determining the  $76.7\%$  vesting outcome. Significant items primarily comprised put option valuation adjustments and business acquisition costs, Mega Distribution Centre transition costs and non-capitalisable Project Horizon implementation costs which included resource costs, accelerated amortisation of legacy software assets and incremental software licence and maintenance costs.

1. Mr Bell retired as operational Group CFO on 31 January 2024 and ceased employment on 29 February 2024. As a 'good leaver', Mr Bell's performance rights in relation to the FY22-FY24 LTI grant remained on foot to be tested at the end of the performance period. The amortisation of all of Mr Bell's performance rights have been accelerated for accounting purposes up to the end of his service period.  
2. Mr Baddock retired as CEO ALM on 6 October 2023 and ceased employment on 9 February 2024. As a 'good leaver', Mr Baddock's performance rights in relation to the FY22-FY24 LTI grant remained on foot to be tested at the end of the performance period. The amortisation of all of Mr Baddock's performance rights have been accelerated for accounting purposes up to the end of his service period.

Based on an interim performance assessment, the expected vesting outcomes of the FY23 and FY24 LTI plans are as follows:

FY23-FY25 LTI grant and FY24-FY26 LTI grant  

<table><tr><td>LTI plan</td><td>ATSR1</td><td>ROFE</td></tr><tr><td>FY23 – FY25 LTI plan</td><td>Below threshold</td><td>Above stretch, below maximum</td></tr><tr><td>FY24 – FY26 LTI plan</td><td>Below threshold</td><td>Below threshold</td></tr></table>

1. This interim performance assessment of the ATSR component is based on a VWAP of $3.91 per share, measured across the 20 business days to 30 April 2024.

1. The grant entitlement is expressed as a percentage of the face value of performance rights divided by the participants' annual fixed remuneration at grant date.  
2. Mr Murray commenced employment on 29 January 2024 as CEO Total Tools. Mr Murray was granted an FY24-FY26 LTI on a pro-rata basis, under the same vesting timelines and performance conditions as the other participants.  
3. Mr Baddock retired as CEO ALM on 6 October 2023 and ceased employment on 9 February 2024. In FY24, Mr Baddock was issued 112,542 performance rights in relation to the FY24-FY26 grant. Mr Baddock is expected to retain 29,188 FY24-FY26 LTI performance rights, determined on a pro-rata basis up to the date of his cessation of employment. These performance rights will remain on foot and will be tested in accordance with existing performance conditions. The amortisation of these performance rights has been accelerated for accounting purposes up to the end of his service period. The balance of 83,354 performance rights were forfeited.  
4. Ms Wallbridge, CEO ALM was appointed on 1 March 2024 and was not eligible for the FY24-FY26 LTI grant.

# 4.7. Additional remuneration arrangements

These additional grants are delivered in performance rights to secure key talent and accelerate growth objectives. Each performance right is a right to acquire a Metcash share at no cost, subject to the satisfaction of performance and service conditions as set out below.

# Group CEO buy-out grant

Upon appointment in FY23, the Group CEO, Mr Jones was provided with a grant of performance rights in consideration of incentives foregone from his previous employer. These performance rights were subject to performance and tenure conditions over two tranches. The first tranche was tested on 31 January 2023 and vested fully, as disclosed in the FY23 Remuneration Report. The second tranche was to be tested as at 31 January 2024, however the Board determined that it was appropriate to defer assessment of the performance conditions until the FY24 EBIT outcome was finalised to ensure the outcome aligned with the overall Group performance. Following Board review and approval, the outcome of the second and final tranche is shown below:

<table><tr><td>Participant</td><td>Tranche</td><td>Performance results</td><td>Vesting result</td><td>No. of rights held</td><td>No. of rights vested</td><td>No. of rights forfeited</td></tr><tr><td>D Jones</td><td>Tranche 2</td><td>Service condition and FY24 Group underlying EBIT performance hurdle met1</td><td>100%</td><td>160,428</td><td>160,428</td><td>—</td></tr></table>

# 6. REMUNERATION GOVERNANCE

The following diagram illustrates Metcash's remuneration governance framework.

# BOARD

The Board is responsible for overseeing and approving recommendations from the People, Culture & Nomination Committee and the Audit, Risk & Compliance Committee. The Board ultimately approve the remuneration outcomes for the Executives.

# AUDIT, RISK & COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE (‘ARCC’)

The ARCC support the PCNC by reviewing the Group's financial results which form the basis for STI and LTI awards and providing advice relating to material risk and accounting issues that may affect the Board's deliberations in determining STI and LTI award outcomes.

# PEOPLE, CULTURE & NOMINATION COMMITTEE (‘PCNC’)

The PCNC is the key governing body in respect of remuneration matters. In addition to Non-executive Director and Executive remuneration, the PCNC oversee major people-related programs such as culture and diversity, equity, and inclusion. The PCNC makes recommendations to the Board based on its review of proposals received from management.

# MANAGEMENT

Provides information relevant to people and remuneration decisions and makes recommendations to the PCNC. Undertakes work as directed by the PCNC including obtaining information from external advisors to assist the Committee with decision making.

# EXTERNAL ADVISORS

The PCNC may commission external advisors to provide information and/or recommendations on remuneration. If recommendations are sought in respect of KMP remuneration, interaction with external advisors is governed by protocol, which ensures the Committee can obtain independent advice. The Committee Chair may appoint and engage directly with external advisors on KMP remuneration matters. Further, any remuneration recommendations obtained from external advisors are used as a guide, rather than as a substitute for the Committee's thorough consideration of the relevant matters. The Committee consider the recommendations, along with other relevant factors, in making remuneration decisions. Both the Committee and the Board are satisfied that the existing protocols ensure that remuneration recommendations obtained from external advisors are free from undue influence from the Executive KMP to whom the remuneration recommendations apply.

The People, Culture & Nomination Committee engage and consider advice from independent remuneration consultants where appropriate in relation to remuneration matters and Non-executive Director fees. During the year, no remuneration recommendations as defined in section 9B of the Corporations Act 2001 were provided.

# 7. NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR REMUNERATION

# Remuneration policy

The objectives of Metcash's policy regarding Non-executive Director fees are:

- To preserve the independence of Non-executive Directors by not including any performance-related element; and  
To be market competitive with regard to Non-executive Director fees in comparable ASX-listed companies and to the time and professional commitment in discharging the responsibilities of the role.

All Non-executive Directors are paid a fixed annual fee. In addition, Committee fees are paid to recognise the additional responsibilities associated with participating on a Board Committee. The fixed fee to the Board Chair is to remunerate the Chair for all responsibilities, including participating on any Board Committees.

To align individual interests with shareholders' interests, Non-executive Directors are encouraged to hold Metcash shares. Non-executive Directors fund their own share purchases and must comply with Metcash's share trading policy.

# Aggregate fee limit

Non-executive Director fees are limited to a maximum aggregate amount approved by shareholders. The current limit of $2,000,000 was approved in 2021.

# Minimum shareholding guidelines

Minimum shareholding guidelines have been implemented for all Non-executive Directors of one year's base fees to be accumulated in five years from the effective date of 1 May 2019 or upon their date of appointment as a Non-executive Director, whichever occurs later.

# Non-executive Director fee structure

The table below outlines the fees paid to Non-executive Directors in FY23 and FY24. In FY24, the Board base fee for Non-executive Directors was increased by  $3.8\%$ , and the Chair and Member fees for the Audit, Risk & Compliance and the People, Culture & Nomination Committees were increased by  $20.1\%$  and  $30.5\%$  respectively. These increases were considered appropriate in the context of the market benchmarks but also to better reflect the growing time commitments and workloads required of the Committee Chairs and Members.

Consistent with the approach for determining executive remuneration, refined market benchmarks have been established for Nonexecutive Director fees from FY25 onwards, using two peer groups: the first is determined by company size and includes similarly sized ASX 200 companies, based upon market capitalisation; the second includes similarly sized companies within a comparable industry.

In consideration of the refined market benchmarks, and the increases applied for FY24, the Board has determined that no increases in fees will be implemented for FY25.

Pursuant to the terms of engagement the Company has with its auditors, EY Australia, the Company has agreed to indemnify EY Australia to the extent permitted by law and professional regulations, against any losses, liabilities, costs or expenses incurred by EY Australia where they arise out of or occur in relation to any negligent, wrongful or wilful act or omission by the Company. No payment has been made to EY Australia by the Company pursuant to this indemnity, either during or since the end of the financial year.

# Non-audit services

Other than the matters disclosed in this report, there were no events that have occurred after the end of the financial year that would materially affect the reported results or would require disclosure in this report.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 APRIL 2024

# 1. CORPORATE INFORMATION

The financial statements of Metcash Limited (the 'Company') and its controlled entities (together the 'Group') for the year ended 30 April 2024 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 24 June 2024.

Metcash Limited is a for-profit company limited by ordinary shares incorporated and domiciled in Australia whose shares are publicly traded on the Australian Securities Exchange. The nature of the operations and principal activities of the Group are described in the Directors' Report. The registered office of the Company is 1 Thomas Holt Drive, Macquarie Park NSW 2113.

# 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES

# 2.1. Basis of preparation

The financial statements are a general-purpose financial report that has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and Australian Accounting Standards and other authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board.

The financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments and share-based payments which are measured at fair value.

The financial statements are presented in Australian dollars and all values are rounded to the nearest $100,000 unless otherwise stated under the option available to the Company under ASIC Corporations Instrument 2016/191. The Company is an entity to which the legislative instrument applies.

The financial statements comply with Australian Accounting Standards. The financial statements also comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).

The current financial year comprises a 52-week period that commenced on 1 May 2023 and ended on 28 April 2024. The prior financial year comprised a 52-week period that commenced on 2 May 2022 and ended on 30 April 2023.

Certain comparative information was amended in these financial statements to conform to the current year presentation. These amendments do not impact the Group's financial results and do not have any significant impact on the Group's balance sheet.

# 2.2. Changes in accounting policy

The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous period.

There are no accounting pronouncements which have become effective from 1 May 2023 that have a significant impact on the Group's financial report. Refer to Appendix A for new or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations.

# 2.3. Material accounting policies

# 2.3.1.Basis of consolidation

# Controlled entities

The financial statements comprise the consolidated financial statements of Metcash Limited and its controlled entities for the year ended 30 April 2024. Refer to Appendix B for a list of controlled entities.

Controlled entities are all those entities over which the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.

# Consolidation procedures

Controlled entities are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in full.

Non-controlling interests are allocated their share of total comprehensive income and are presented as a separate category within equity.

The financial statements of controlled entities are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent entity, using consistent accounting policies. For those controlled entities with non-coterminous year-ends, management accounts for the relevant period to the Group's reporting date have been consolidated. In the opinion of the Directors, the expense of providing additional coterminous statutory accounts, together with consequential delay in producing the Group's financial statements, would outweigh any benefit to shareholders.

# Separate financial statements

Investments in entities controlled by Metcash Limited are accounted for at cost in the separate financial statements of the parent entity less any impairment charges. Dividends received from controlled entities are recorded as income in the separate financial statements of the parent entity, and do not impact the recorded cost of the investment unless the dividends effectively represent a return of capital.

# 2.4. Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions

The Group has incorporated judgements, estimates and assumptions in determining the amounts recognised in the financial statements based on conditions existing at balance date.

# 2.4.1. Significant accounting judgements

In the process of applying the Group's accounting policies, the following judgements were made, apart from those involving estimations, which have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.

<table><tr><td>Note</td><td>Areas</td><td>Judgements</td></tr><tr><td>Note 3.2</td><td>Sales revenue</td><td>- Charge-through sales-In addition to warehouse purchases, customers purchase goods through the Group&#x27;s charge-through platform and have these goods delivered directly to them from suppliers. The Group earns a margin on these sales for providing procurement, cross-docking and settlement services. The Group also bears credit risk on the receivables from these sales with limited recourse to suppliers.
- The Group determined that it is an agent in these contracts as it does not control the goods before they are transferred to customers.</td></tr><tr><td>Note 4.2</td><td>Leases</td><td>- Determination of lease term of contracts with renewal options.</td></tr><tr><td>Note 4.3</td><td>Inventories</td><td>- Supplier rebate income-The recognition and measurement of supplier rebate income requires the use of judgement, due to a high degree of variability and complexity in arrangements with suppliers, and due to timing differences between stock purchases and the provision of promotional services.</td></tr><tr><td>Note 6.1</td><td>Business combinations</td><td>- Determining the existence of control, joint control or significant influence over the Group&#x27;s acquisitions. Where the Group exercises significant influence or joint control, the acquisitions are accounted for as equity accounted investments (note 4.4); and where the Group exercises control, the acquisitions are accounted for as business combinations.
-Determining the acquisition date fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on acquisition of controlled entities.</td></tr></table>

# 2.4.2. Significant accounting estimates

The carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities are often determined based on estimates and assumptions of future events. The key estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities within the next annual reporting period are:

<table><tr><td>Note</td><td>Areas</td><td>Estimates</td></tr><tr><td>Note 4.1</td><td>Trade receivables and loans</td><td>Allowance for impairment loss</td></tr><tr><td>Note 4.4</td><td>Equity-accounted investments</td><td>Assessment of recoverable amount</td></tr><tr><td>Note 4.7</td><td>Impairment of non-financial assets</td><td>Assessment of recoverable amount</td></tr><tr><td>Note 4.2 and 4.8</td><td>Provisions</td><td>Property provisions</td></tr><tr><td>Note 5.3</td><td>Put option liabilities</td><td>Determining put option consideration</td></tr></table>

# 3. GROUP PERFORMANCE

# 3.1. Segment information

The Group has identified its operating segments based on the internal reports that are reviewed and used by the Chief Executive Officer (the chief operating decision maker) in assessing performance and in determining the allocation of resources. Discrete financial information about these operating segments is reported on at least a monthly basis.

The information reported to the CEO is aggregated based on product types and the overall economic characteristics of industries in which the Group operates. The Group's reportable segments are therefore as follows:

- Food activities comprise the distribution of a range of products and services to independent supermarket and convenience retail outlets.  
- Hardware activities comprise the distribution of hardware products to independent retail outlets and the operation of company owned and joint venture retail stores.  
- Liquor activities comprise the distribution of liquor products to independent retail outlets and hotels.

The Group operates predominantly in Australia. The Group has operations in New Zealand that represent less than  $5\%$  of revenue, results and assets of the Group. The Group does not have a single customer which represents greater than  $10\%$  of the Group's revenue.

Sales between segments are based on similar terms and conditions to those in place with third party customers and are eliminated from the results below.

Segment results  

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">Segment revenue</td><td colspan="2">Segment EBIT</td></tr><tr><td>FY24$m</td><td>FY23$m</td><td>FY24$m</td><td>FY23$m</td></tr><tr><td>Food</td><td>8,307.8</td><td>8,410.1</td><td>210.1</td><td>204.0</td></tr><tr><td>Hardware</td><td>2,471.0</td><td>2,344.1</td><td>210.9</td><td>219.2</td></tr><tr><td>Liquor</td><td>5,133.6</td><td>5,049.2</td><td>109.2</td><td>104.1</td></tr><tr><td>Segment total</td><td>15,912.4</td><td>15,803.4</td><td>530.2</td><td>527.3</td></tr><tr><td>Corporate</td><td></td><td></td><td>(33.9)</td><td>(26.5)</td></tr><tr><td>Group underlying earnings before interest and tax (&#x27;EBIT&#x27;)</td><td></td><td></td><td>496.3</td><td>500.8</td></tr><tr><td>Finance costs, net (Note 3.3)</td><td></td><td></td><td>(92.6)</td><td>(64.7)</td></tr><tr><td>Significant items (Note 3.3)</td><td></td><td></td><td>(31.9)</td><td>(59.6)</td></tr><tr><td>Profit before income tax</td><td></td><td></td><td>371.8</td><td>376.5</td></tr></table>

# 3.2. Sales revenue

# Sale of goods

The Group's revenue principally arises from the sale of goods within its wholesale distribution and retail operations. Sales revenue is recognised when the Group has delivered goods to its customers, and it is probable that consideration will be collected in exchange. Revenue is measured based on the consideration expected to be received, net of trade rebates.

# Charge-through sales

The Group operates a charge-through platform whereby goods are delivered directly to the Group's customers by suppliers. The Group retains the credit risk associated with these transactions; however, the Group does not bear any material inventory risk or exercise any material discretion in establishing prices. Charge-through transactions are therefore reported on an agency or net 'commission' basis with the gross sale value included in trade receivables and the gross purchase cost included in trade payables. Gross charge-through sales to customers during the year were  $2.267 billion (FY23:$ 2.249 billion).

# MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

# Finance costs

Finance costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset. All other finance costs are expensed in the period they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.

Certain provisions are measured at their discounted value. During each period the provision is increased by an amount that is equal to the provision multiplied by the discount rate. This increment, including any change in the value of the provision as a result of a change in discount rate, is treated as a finance cost.

# Project Horizon implementation costs

Project Horizon is a critical group technical infrastructure consolidation and replacement program aimed at repositioning Metcash to be a modern, technology-led wholesaler. The program provides the platform to drive simplification and efficiency across the Food & Liquor businesses, as well as making it easier for customers and suppliers to do business with Metcash. The program continues to make steady progress, most recently delivering a streamlined all-in-one payables solution. The program is expected to be completed by the end of FY26.

In FY24, the Group incurred $20.6 million (FY23: $34.6 million) of expenses on the project. The project expenses included resource costs, accelerated amortisation and impairment of redundant software assets and incremental software licence and maintenance costs. These costs are separately disclosed within significant items in the Statement of Comprehensive Income to enable a better understanding of the Group's results.

# Put option valuation and business acquisition costs

The carrying amounts of the Group's put option liabilities at balance date were remeasured to reflect the estimated put option exercise prices, with a credit relating to the net reduction in put option value of  $11.3 million (FY23: increase in put option value of$ 17.5 million) recorded as a significant item within the Statement of Comprehensive Income, together with the net present value interest unwind expense on the put option liabilities of $8.0 million (FY23: $9.5 million).

In addition, the Group incurred transaction costs of  $12.0 million (FY23:$ 1.5 million) in relation to business acquisitions in FY24 including Bianco Construction Supplies, Alpine Truss and Total Tools JV stores as detailed in Note 6.1 as well as in relation to the acquisition of Superior Food Services which was completed on 3 June 2024 as detailed in Note 7.4.

# Mega Distribution Centre (DC) transition costs

The Group continues to invest in its mega DC's capacity, capabilities, footprint & supply chain systems to support current and future business opportunities. During the period, the Group incurred $2.6 million (FY23: $4.3 million) of net costs primarily associated with the planned move to the new DC in Truganina, Victoria which is expected to be operational in mid FY25.

# Impairment, net of reversals

In FY23, the Group recognised a $7.3 million reversal of impairment in relation to its joint venture entity, Adcome Pty Ltd (Cornetts) reflecting an increase in the estimated recoverable amount of the investment since the date the impairment loss was originally recognised in FY12.

In addition, in FY23 an impairment reversal of $2.0 million was recognised reflecting a decrease in the expected credit losses previously recognised in relation to specific groups of trade receivables impacted by COVID-19 provisions.

During the year, the Group paid  $131.5 million of income tax (FY23:$ 151.7 million). The income tax paid exceeded the level of income tax expense of $113.7 million (FY23: $116.2 million) due to the increase in the ATO prescribed income tax instalment rate. Part of this excess is expected to be refunded upon lodgement of the Group's FY24 income tax returns.

# Tax consolidation

Metcash Limited and its  $100\%$  owned Australian resident subsidiaries formed a tax consolidated group with effect from 1 July 2005. Metcash Limited is the head entity of the tax consolidated group. Members of the group have entered into a tax sharing arrangement in order to allocate income tax expense to the wholly owned subsidiaries on a modified standalone basis. In addition, the agreement provides for the allocation of income tax liabilities between the entities should the head entity default on its tax payment obligations.

# Tax effect accounting by members of the tax consolidated group

Members of the tax consolidated group have entered into a tax funding agreement. The tax funding agreement provides for the allocation of current taxes to members of the tax consolidated group in accordance with a group allocation method using modified standalone tax calculations as the basis for allocation. Deferred taxes of members of the tax consolidated group are measured and recognised in accordance with the principles of AASB 112 Income Taxes.

Under the tax funding agreement, funding is based upon the amounts allocated and recognised by the member entities. Accordingly, funding results in an increase/decrease in the subsidiaries' intercompany accounts with the tax consolidated group head entity, Metcash Limited.

# MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authority. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the relevant reporting date.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward unused tax assets and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised:

- except where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting nor taxable profit or loss; and  
in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.

# MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basic earnings per share is calculated as net profit attributable to members of the parent, adjusted to exclude any costs of servicing equity divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares, adjusted for any bonus element.

Diluted earnings per share are calculated as net profit attributable to members of the parent, adjusted for:

costs of servicing equity (other than dividends);  
- the after-tax effect of dividends and interest associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares that have been recognised as expenses; and  
- other non-discretionary changes in revenues or expenses during the period that would result from the dilution of potential ordinary shares, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares and dilutive potential ordinary shares, adjusted for any bonus element. Contingently issuable ordinary shares are included in the diluted weighted average number of shares only if the relevant condition of the issue is satisfied at the end of the reporting period.

# Weighted average interest

Trade and other receivables are non-interest-bearing and repayment terms vary by pillar. As at 30 April 2024,  $7.6 million (FY23:$ 5.5 million) of customer loans are non-interest-bearing and $10.2 million (FY23: $10.6 million) of customer loans have a weighted average annual interest rate of 7.1% (FY23: 7.2%).

# Maturity of trade receivables

At 30 April 2024,  $96.9\%$  (FY23:  $89.2\%$ ) of trade receivables are either due or required to be settled within 30 days,  $1.0\%$  (FY23:  $9.7\%$ ) have terms extending from 30 to 60 days and  $2.1\%$  (FY23:  $1.1\%$ ) have terms greater than 60 days.

# Customer charge cards agreement

Under an agreement between Metcash and American Express (Amex), eligible retail customers make trade purchases from Metcash using their Amex customer charge cards. Metcash's trade receivable is settled in full by Amex. Amex subsequently collects the amounts outstanding on the customer charge cards directly from the retailers.

Under the agreement, in the event a customer defaults on their payment obligation to Amex, Metcash must reacquire the trade receivable from Amex. The maximum amount payable by Metcash to Amex is limited to the actual face value of the outstanding trade receivable and does not include any interest or any other costs incurred by Amex. Once reacquired, Metcash would seek to collect the trade receivable from the retail customer through its normal credit processes.

The agreement was renewed during the prior year and operates on an evergreen basis until either Metcash or Amex provides a 12-month notice of cancellation. The earliest date on which the agreement could be cancelled is 30 June 2025.

The customer charge cards agreement is presented as part of current trade and other receivables and a matching current liability of  $235.6 million (FY23:$ 232.5 million) is included within trade and other payables, with no impact to the Group's net asset position.

# Customer loan security

The Group has access to security against most customer loans in the event of default. Security held may include bank and personal guarantees, fixed and floating charges and security over property and other assets. Due to the large number and the varied nature of security held, their fair value cannot be practicably estimated. The fair value of the security against a loan is determined when the loan is not deemed to be recoverable and an allowance for impairment loss is raised to cover any deficit in recoverability.

# MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

# Trade receivables

Trade receivables are measured at the transaction price determined under the 'Sales Revenue' material accounting policy (Note 3.2).

# Allowance for impairment loss

The Group recognises an allowance for impairment loss based on expected credit losses (ECL) for its trade and other receivables. The Group has established a provision rate matrix, under the simplified approach in calculating ECL, that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to a group of debtors and the economic environment.

# SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

# Allowance for impairment loss

The Group uses a provision rate matrix to calculate ECLs for receivables. The provision rates are initially based on the Group's historical observed default rates. The Group will calibrate the matrix to adjust the historical credit loss experience with forward-looking information (e.g., any known changes in market conditions with reference to the most recent gross domestic product data). At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.

The assessment of the correlation between historical observed default rates, forecast economic conditions and ECLs is a significant estimate. The amount of ECLs is sensitive to changes in circumstances and of forecast economic conditions. The Group's historical credit loss experience and forecast of economic conditions may also not be representative of customer's actual default in the future.

The present value of lease payments to be made under these options that are considered reasonably certain to be exercised have been included in the lease liability balance at 30 April 2024. The undiscounted potential future payments at current rental rates under options that are not considered reasonably certain to be exercised is approximately $2.1 billion, which includes potential lease payments within the next five years of approximately $192.1 million.

# MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

# Group as a lessee

# Right-of-use assets

The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement of a lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). The initial measurement of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are subsequently measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. Unless the Group is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term. Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment assessments under AASB 136 Impairment of Assets.

# Depreciation

Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis on all right-of-use assets. Major depreciation periods are:

<table><tr><td></td><td>FY24</td><td>FY23</td></tr><tr><td>Leasehold properties</td><td>1-30 years</td><td>1-30 years</td></tr><tr><td>Motor vehicles and equipment</td><td>4-5 years</td><td>4-5 years</td></tr></table>

Useful lives are reassessed on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis.

# Lease liabilities

At the commencement of a lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include renewal periods where the Group is reasonably certain to exercise the renewal option. Outgoings and other variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as incurred.

In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset.

# Group as a lessor

# Lease receivables

The Group enters into back-to-back lease agreements with independent retailers where the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the subslessee and these are classified as a finance lease.

Amounts due from finance leases are recognised as lease receivables at the amount of the Group's net investment in the lease. Lease receivables are subsequently remeasured if there is a change in the lease term and for changes in future cash flows resulting from a change in an index or rate or variable lease payments becoming fixed. Finance lease income is allocated to reporting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the Group's net investment outstanding in respect of the leases.

All other leases are classified as operating leases. Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.

# Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets

The Group applies a recognition exemption to leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option. It also applies a recognition exemption to leases that are considered of low value. Lease payments and rental income from short-term and low-value leases are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

# SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENT

# Determination of lease term of contracts with renewal options

The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.

After initial recognition, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise (or not to exercise) the option to renew.

# SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

# Property provisions

The Group recognises provisions for rental agreements on acquisition. In measuring these provisions, assumptions are made about future retail sales, rental costs and in determining the appropriate discount rate to be used in the cash flow calculations.

The Group has recognised a provision in accordance with the accounting policy described above. The Group assesses obligations on property make-good, restructuring and other costs. These estimates are determined using assumptions on property-related costs, redundancy and other closure or restructure costs.

4.3. Inventories  

<table><tr><td></td><td>FY24
$m</td><td>FY23
$m</td></tr><tr><td>Inventories</td><td>1,196.9</td><td>1,183.4</td></tr></table>

# MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Inventory cost is measured at purchase price, net of trade rebates and discounts received, and including costs incurred in bringing the inventory to its present location and condition. Trade rebates include supplier rebate income, which is systematically allocated against inventory cost using estimates based on expected purchase patterns and earn rates.

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, net of estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

1. The Group has a direct ownership of  $26.0\%$  in LA United Pty Ltd and an indirect ownership of  $49.3\%$  via its interest in Liquor Alliance Pty Ltd. While the Group has beneficial ownership of more than  $50\%$  of the entity, key operating and financial decisions require the unanimous consent of other joint venture partners. Accordingly, LA United Pty Ltd and Liquor Alliance Pty Ltd are accounted for as joint arrangements.

The principal place of business for all of the Group's equity-accounted investments is Australia, with the exception of Metcash Export Services Pty Ltd, which primarily deals with customers in China.

# (c) Unrecognised share of gains or losses of equity accounted investments

At the reporting date, the Group's share of unrecognised gains or losses is not material.

Refer to note 7.3 for details of the Group's contingent liabilities in relation to equity-accounted investments.

# MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Equity-accounted investments of the Group represent both associates and joint ventures and are structured through equity participation in separate legal entities. Metcash invests capital to support the independent retail network, strengthen relationships and fund growth. Relationships with co-investors are governed by contractual agreements which allow the Group to exercise either significant influence or joint control over these entities. Where the Group exercises joint control, key operating decisions are agreed unanimously, regardless of ownership interest.

The Group's investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method. Associates are those entities over which the Group exercises significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies. A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.

Equity-accounted investments are carried in the statement of financial position at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group's share of net assets of the investee, less any impairment in value.

For those associates and joint ventures with non-coterminous year ends, management accounts for the relevant period to the Group's reporting date have been equity-accounted. In the opinion of the Directors, the expense of providing additional coterminous statutory accounts, together with consequential delay in producing the Group's financial statements, would outweigh any benefit to shareholders.

# SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

# Impairment of equity-accounted investments

After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an impairment loss on its investment in its associate or joint venture. At each reporting date, the Group determines whether there is objective evidence that the investment in the associate or joint venture is impaired. If there is such evidence, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate or joint venture and its carrying value.

In assessing the recoverable amount, assumptions are made about the growth prospects of the investment and in determining the discount rate used to calculate the net present value of future cash flows when a discounted cash flow model is used.

An impairment loss recognised in prior periods is reversed if there has been a change in estimates used to determine the equity-accounted investments recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If this is the case, the carrying amount of the investment is increased to its recoverable amount, with the increase being recognised as a reversal of an impairment loss in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

# MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

# Recognition and measurement

All classes of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.

# Depreciation

Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis on all property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land and assets under construction. Major depreciation periods are:

# MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

# Recognition and measurement

Intangible assets acquired separately or in a business combination are initially measured at cost. Following initial recognition, the cost model is applied to the class of intangible assets.

Intangible assets (excluding software development costs) created within the business are not capitalised and expenditure is charged against profits in the period in which the expenditure is incurred.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is initially measured at cost; being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group's interest in the net fair value of the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities.

Trade names are acquired either through business combinations or through direct acquisition. Trade names are recognised as intangible assets where a registered trademark is acquired with attributable value. Trade names are valued on a relief from royalty method. Trade names are considered to be indefinite life intangibles and are not amortised, unless there is an intention to discontinue use of the name in which case it is amortised over its estimated remaining useful life.

Customer contracts are acquired through business combinations. Customer contacts are recognised as intangible assets when the criteria specified in AASB 138 Intangible Assets have been met. Customer contracts are valued by applying a discounted cash flow valuation methodology with consideration given to customer retention and projected future cash flows to the end of the contract period. The amortisation has been recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.

Software development costs incurred on an individual project are capitalised at cost when future recoverability can reasonably be assured and where the Group has an intention and ability to use the asset. Following the initial recognition of software development costs, the asset is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Any costs carried forward are amortised over the assets' useful economic lives.

Configuration and customisation costs incurred in implementing cloud-based arrangements are only capitalised if the implementation activities create an intangible asset that the Group controls in accordance with the requirements of AASB 138 Intangible Assets. Costs that do not result in intangible assets are expensed as incurred. The exception is where they are paid to the suppliers of the cloud-based arrangement to significantly customise the cloud-based software for the Group. In this case, the costs are recorded as a prepayment for services and amortised over the expected renewable term of the arrangement.

# Derecognition

Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income when the asset is derecognised. When goodwill forms part of a group of cash generating units and an operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the groups of cash-generating units retained.

# Useful lives

The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to either be finite or indefinite. Where amortisation is charged on assets with finite lives, this expense is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis.

The estimated useful lives of existing finite life intangible assets are as follows:

<table><tr><td></td><td>FY24</td><td>FY23</td></tr><tr><td>Customer contracts</td><td>15 years</td><td>15 years</td></tr><tr><td>Software development costs</td><td>5-10 years</td><td>5-10 years</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>10 years</td><td>10 years</td></tr></table>

Useful lives are reassessed on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

# 4.7. Impairment of non-financial assets

# Impairment tests for goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives

# Description of cash generating units

Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored, being the three cash generating units (or 'CGU's) – Food, Hardware and Liquor. Indefinite life intangibles primarily comprise trade names and licences.

# Allocation to CGUs

The carrying amounts of goodwill and indefinite life intangibles are allocated to the Group's CGUs as follows:

# Assessment of recoverable amounts

The recoverable amounts were determined based on value in use calculations using cash flow projections covering a five-year period, which are based on strategic plans or forecasts. Estimates beyond the five-year period are calculated using terminal growth rates that are applicable to the trading environment in which the CGU operates.

# Key assumptions used in assessment

The valuations used to support the carrying amounts of intangible assets are based on forward looking key assumptions that are, by nature, uncertain. The nature and basis of the key assumptions used to estimate future cash flows and the discount rates used in the projections, when determining the recoverable amount of each CGU, are set out below and in the table above:

- Operating cash flows - Operating cash flow projections are extracted from the most recent strategic plans or forecasts that relate to the existing asset base. For each CGU, the cash flow projections for a five-year period have been determined based on expectations of future performance. Key assumptions in the cash flows include sales volume growth, costs of sales and costs of doing business. These assumptions are based on expectations of market demand and operational performance.  
Cash flow projections are based on risk-adjusted forecasts allowing for estimated changes in the business, the competitive trading environment, legislation and economic growth whilst noting that uncertainties remain over the potential impact of changes to consumer behaviour and other uncertainties surrounding macroeconomic indicators such as unemployment and GDP growth create future uncertainty over the Group's operating cash flows.  
Discount rates - Discount rates are based on the weighted average cost of capital ('WACC') for the Group adjusted for an asset-specific risk premium assigned to each CGU. The asset-specific risk premium is determined based on risk embedded within the cash flow projections and other factors specific to the industries in which the CGUs operate.  
The calculation of WACC is market-driven and key inputs include target capital structure, equity beta, market risk premium, risk-free rate of return and debt risk premium. Pre-tax equivalents of the adopted discount rates are derived iteratively and differ based on the timing and extent of tax cash flows. Pre-tax rates were  $14.4\%$  across all CGUs (FY23:  $13.4\%$  across all CGUs).  
- Terminal growth rates - Cash flows beyond the projection period are extrapolated indefinitely using estimated long-term growth rates applicable to the trading environment in which the CGUs operate. A terminal growth rate of  $2.5\%$  was applied to all CGUs.

# Results of assessment

Based on the FY24 assessment, no impairment of goodwill was identified in any of the Group's CGUs.

# Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions

At the assessment date, no reasonably likely change in key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of any CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.

# MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that the value of a non-financial asset may be impaired. Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.

Where an indicator of impairment exists, the Group makes a formal estimate of recoverable amount.

Recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. It is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset's value in use cannot be estimated to be close to its fair value less costs to sell and it does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. In this case, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU to which the asset belongs.

When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated pre-tax future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

# MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

# Employee entitlements

Wages, salaries, incentives, annual leave and sick leave

Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits, incentives, annual leave and accumulating sick leave, are recognised in provisions in respect of employees' services up to the reporting date. They are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. Liabilities due to be settled within 12 months of the reporting date are classified as current liabilities. Liabilities for non-accumulating sick leave are recognised when the leave is taken and are measured at the rates paid or payable.

# Long service leave

The liability for long service leave is recognised in the provision for employee benefits and measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures, and periods of service. Expected future payments at the reporting date are discounted using market yields on high-quality corporate bonds with terms to maturity that match as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows.

# Property provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

Property provisions include the value of certain retail store lease obligations recognised as part of the acquisition of Franklin in FY12. The provision is initially recognised at the acquisition date fair value and subsequently utilised to settle lease obligations. The provision related to an individual lease is derecognised when the Group has met or otherwise extinguished its obligations in full under that lease.

Provisions are also recognised for obligations such as guarantees, property make-good and other costs. Depending on the nature of these obligations, they are expected to be settled over the term of the lease, at the conclusion of the lease or otherwise when the obligation vests.

If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are measured at the net present value of the expected future cash outflows using a current pre-tax rate that reflects the risks specific to the liability. During each period the provision is increased by an amount that is equal to the provision multiplied by the discount rate. This increment, including any change in the value of the provision as a result of a change in discount rate, is treated as a finance cost.

# SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

# Property provisions

The Group recognises provisions for rental agreements on acquisition. In measuring these provisions, assumptions are made about future retail sales, rental costs and in determining the appropriate discount rate to be used in the cash flow calculations.

The Group assesses obligations on property make-good, restructuring and other costs. These estimates are determined using assumptions on property-related costs, redundancy and other closure or restructure costs.

# Financial covenants

Refer to note 5.6 for details of the Group's core borrowing facilities. The core borrowings of the Group must comply with two primary covenants which apply to the syndicated, bilateral and working capital bank facilities. They include a Fixed Charges Cover Ratio and a Senior Leverage Ratio. There were no defaults or breaches on the Group's core borrowings in FY24 and FY23.

# Weighted average interest

The weighted average effective interest rate on the syndicated, bilateral and working capital loans was  $5.66\%$  (FY23:  $3.73\%$ ), reflecting an average BBSY of  $4.20\%$  (FY23:  $2.55\%$ ) over the year. These rates exclude line fees on unutilised facility balances.

# Statement of Cashflows - Proceeds from and repayment of borrowings

The Statement of Cash Flows sets out the Group's proceeds from borrowings of  $6.33 billion (FY23:$ 4.50 billion), which includes gross proceeds from syndicated and bilateral loans of  $6.13 billion (FY23:$ 4.38 billion) and net proceeds from working capital loans of $115.8 million (FY23: $123.4 million). The increased volume of proceeds and repayments during the current year reflects higher debt levels and greater volatility in working capital requirements.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

# MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the borrowing.

After initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised.

# Total Tools Group put options

On 30 November 2023, Metcash increased its ownership from  $85\%$  to  $100\%$  in Total Tools Holdings Pty Ltd (TTH), which is the parent entity in the Total Tools Group, following the exercise of a put option by the holders of the minority  $15\%$  ownership interest. The purchase consideration for the remaining  $15\%$  interest of $101.5 million was paid on 30 November 2023 and accounted for as a reduction in the associated put option liability to nil.

In addition, Metcash has reset its put option arrangements with a number of its Total Tools joint venture (JV) stores. This is to provide JV partners with a balance between receiving some capital upfront and remaining both vested and engaged in the ongoing success of their stores through continued equity interest.

During FY24, Metcash has reset put option arrangements for 11 JV stores by acquiring an additional ownership interest upfront and deferring the put option in relation to the residual ownership interest by a further three years. The original put options in relation to these 11 stores were exercisable in May 2024. Metcash has now increased its ownership of these stores (FY23 ownership interest  $51\%$  -  $60\%$ , up to revised ownership interest  $80\%$  -  $95\%$ ) for upfront purchase consideration of $42.5 million (allocated against the put option liability). The revised put options over the residual  $5\%$  -  $20\%$  ownership interests are now exercisable in May 2027 (the put option value of these residual  $5\%$  -  $20\%$  interests at FY24 was $20.7 million).

In conjunction with the above JV reset, Metcash also reduced its ownership interest in 6 corporate stores from an FY23 ownership interest of  $100\%$  to an ownership interest of between  $51\%$  and  $70\%$ , for  $\$6.9$  million sale consideration ( $\$5.0$  million deferred). Metcash has issued put options in relation to these stores over the residual ownership interest of between  $30\%$  and  $49\%$ , exercisable in May 2027 (4 stores) and May 2030 (2 stores), which are indicatively valued at  $\$12.3$  million.

Further, in FY24 Total Tools acquired a  $51\%$  ownership interest in five JV stores from franchise owners and established two greenfield JV stores (refer note 6.1).

The Total Tools JV Store put option agreements allow individual minority shareholders to sell their remaining equity interests in the 51 JV Stores to Total Tools. Metcash has the right to acquire the remaining equity interests via call options, generally exercisable at any time. The exercise price of the put options are based on a multiple of the respective store's EBITDA over a 12-month period immediately prior to the respective exercise dates, adjusted for a number of items, including net debt and working capital.

The Group has recognised financial liabilities for the Total Tools JV Store put options, has derecognised the non-controlling interests in the Total Tools JV Stores and has ceased accounting for the non-controlling interests. Accordingly, the Statement of Comprehensive Income includes  $100\%$  of the net profit of the Total Tools JV Stores.

The above put option liabilities are remeasured at each reporting date at the estimated put option exercise price, with any change in value recorded as a significant item within the Statement of Comprehensive Income, together with the net present value interest unwind on the put option liability.

At balance date, Total Tools has ownership of between  $51\%$  and  $95\%$  in 51 Total Tools JV stores. The carrying amount of the Total Tools Group put option liabilities was \ $151.6 million (FY23: \$ 268.6 million). Refer note 3.3(VII) of the financial report for details in relation to the put option valuation adjustments recognised during the year.

# Other put options

The Group has also recognised a liability of  $23.8 million (FY23:$ 13.6 million) in respect of an additional 5 put options written over non-controlling interests in non-wholly owned subsidiaries within the Hardware pillar, including $11.9 million acquired in FY24 for M&B and TT Hobart. These put option arrangements allow minority shareholders to sell their equity interests to Metcash, subject to specific terms and conditions. These put options are measured at the present value of the redemption amount under the option.

# MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Arrangements within certain business combinations entitle the non-controlling interests to require the Group to acquire their shareholding via exercise of a put option, subject to specific terms and conditions. Where such an arrangement is deemed to be part of the business combination, a financial liability is recognised on the acquisition date measured at the present value of the redemption amount under the arrangement. The initial recognition of the put option liability is charged directly to retained earnings and the non-controlling interest is derecognised.

The put option liability is subsequently remeasured at each reporting date at the estimated put option exercise price, with any change in value recorded within the Statement of Comprehensive Income, together with the net present value interest unwind on the put option liability.

# SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE

The valuations used to determine the carrying amount of put option liabilities are based on forward looking key assumptions that are, by nature, uncertain. This requires an estimation of future earnings and cash flows which includes assumptions in relation to sales volume growth, cost of sales and costs of doing business.

# Contingent put option liabilities

# Ritchies Stores Pty Ltd (Ritchies) put option

The Group has a put option with Ritchies Stores Pty Ltd (Ritchies). Metcash has a  $29.9\%$  (FY23:  $29.9\%$ ) ownership interest in Ritchies, which is recognised as an equity-accounted investment on the Group's balance sheet. The remaining shareholders in Ritchies have the right to put their  $70.1\%$  (FY23:  $70.1\%$ ) ownership interests to Metcash, via a put option, subject to a margin related annual financial hurdle ('hurdle') being achieved.

The put option can be exercised collectively by all shareholders during a prescribed period following the approval of Ritchies' annual audited financial report ('group put option' representing the remaining  $70.1\%$  shareholding) or in certain circumstances by individual minority shareholders within a prescribed period ('small shareholder put option').

Should the hurdle be achieved, and the shareholders elect to exercise any put option, the purchase consideration payable by Metcash is based on a multiple of the prior year reported earnings, normalised for certain adjustments.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

Whilst the financial hurdle was achieved in respect of Ritchies' 2023 financial year, the group put option was not exercised in relation to that year. Metcash estimates that the group put option consideration payable to Ritchies shareholders in respect of the 2023 financial year would have been between $255.0 million and $265.0 million.

If any put options were to be exercised in future years, the exercise price will be determined with reference to Ritchies' results for that financial year and the consideration payable would reflect those results.

The put option agreement terminates when Metcash ceases to hold shares in Ritchies or if Ritchies lists on the ASX.

The Ritchies put option is recognised at a fair value of nil.

# MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

# Share-based payments reserve

The share-based payments reserve is used to record the value of equity benefits provided to executives as part of their remuneration. Once a performance right has lapsed the Group no longer has any obligation to convert these performance rights into share capital. The amount transferred to retained earnings represents the value of share-based payments previously recognised as an expense that have subsequently lapsed.

# Foreign currency translation reserve

The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries.

# Cash flow hedge reserve

The cash flow hedge reserve records the portion of the unrealised gain or loss on a hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge that is determined to be an effective hedge.

# 5.6. Financial risk management

# Objectives and policies

The Group's principal financial instruments comprise bank loans and overdrafts, leases, cash and short-term deposits and derivatives. The main purpose of these instruments is to finance the Group's operations. The Group also has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and payables, which arise directly from its operations.

The main risks arising from the Group's financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign exchange risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are detailed below. The objective of the Group's risk management policy is to support delivery of the Group's financial targets while protecting future financial security.

# Liquidity risk and funding management

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its payment obligations when they fall due under normal and extreme circumstances. To limit this risk, the Group manages assets with liquidity in mind, and monitors future cash flows and liquidity on a daily basis. The Group's primary sources of debt funding are syndicated, bilateral and working capital facilities, of which  $29.8\%$  (FY23:  $40.6\%$ ) has been utilised as at 30 April 2024. The Group monitors forecasts of liquidity reserves on the basis of expected cash flow.

# Available credit facilities

At the reporting date, the Group had the following unused credit facilities available for its immediate use:

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

# Syndicated facilities

Syndicated bank loans are senior unsecured revolving facilities. The facilities are due to expire in September 2025 ( $100.0 million), May 2026 ($ 200.0 million), May 2027 ( $300.0 million) and May 2028 ($ 125.0 million). Interest is payable on the facilities based on BBSY plus a margin. The applicable margin is dependent upon an escalation matrix linked to the Senior Leverage Ratio achieved. These bank loans are subject to certain financial undertakings as detailed in note 5.2.

Subsequent to the year end, as part of the Group's refinancing activities, an existing facility maturing in September 2025 for  $100.0 million was refinanced for five years, whilst an additional$ 350.0 million of facilities was added in 2029 ( $100.0 million) and 2031 ($ 250.0 million).

# Working capital

Working capital bank loans are represented by five unsecured revolving facilities totalling  $429.5 million. Three of these facilities mature in November 2024 ($ 180.0 million), with the others in February 2025 ( $125.0 million) and July 2025 ($ 124.5 million).

Subsequent to year end, as part of the Group's refinancing activities, two facilities totalling \(100.0 million were cancelled/reduced. The remaining facilities totalling \)325.0 million mature in November 2024 (\(130.0 million), February 2025 (\)75.0 million) and July 2025 (\(120.0 million).

Interest payable on any loans drawn under these facilities is based on BBSY or the RBA cash rate plus a margin. These bank loans are subject to certain financial undertakings as detailed in note 5.2.

# Bilateral loans

Bilateral bank loans are represented by one unsecured revolving facility totalling $50.0 million. This facility matures in December 2028. Interest payable on any loans drawn under this facility is based on BBSY plus a margin. These bank loans are subject to certain financial undertakings as detailed in note 5.2.

# Maturity analysis of financial liabilities based on contracted date

The following table reflects the gross contracted values of financial liabilities categorised by their contracted dates of settlement.

Gross settled derivatives comprise forward exchange contracts that are used to hedge anticipated purchase commitments. Under the terms of these agreements, the settlements at expiry include both a cash payment and receipt.

# Interest rate risk

The Group's exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group's bank debt obligations with a floating interest rate.

Metcash manages this risk by entering into interest rate swap contracts with various major Australian banks. At 30 April 2024, the principal hedged was  $150.0 million (FY23:$ 150.0 million) with a weighted average hedge maturity of 1.3 years (FY23: 1.2 years) and a weighted average fixed interest rate of  $3.7\%$  (FY23:  $3.7\%$ ). The Group considered these derivatives to be effective hedges in accordance with AASB 9 Financial Instruments and therefore treats them as cash flow hedges. These interest rate swaps are exposed to fair value movements based on changes to the interest rate curve.

The Group's treasury policy provides percentage ranges across yearly periods for the interest rate hedging of net debt. Core debt is defined as the minimum level of drawn debt which is expected to occur over the year. At 30 April 2024, Metcash has $352.5 million (FY23: $443.3 million) bank debt obligations.

At the reporting date, the Group had the following mix of financial assets and liabilities exposed to Australian variable interest rate risk that, except as indicated, are not designated in cash flow hedges:

<table><tr><td></td><td>FY24
$m</td><td>FY23
$m</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">FINANCIAL ASSETS</td></tr><tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents</td><td>97.3</td><td>89.5</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">FINANCIAL LIABILITIES</td></tr><tr><td>Bank loans – syndicated</td><td>(300.0)</td><td>(200.0)</td></tr><tr><td>Bank loans – working capital</td><td>(52.5)</td><td>(168.3)</td></tr><tr><td>Bank loans – bilateral</td><td>—</td><td>(75.0)</td></tr><tr><td>Less: Interest rate swaps notional principal value – designated as cash flow hedges</td><td>150.0</td><td>150.0</td></tr><tr><td>Net exposure</td><td>(202.5)</td><td>(203.8)</td></tr></table>

# Sensitivity analysis

Based on the Group's net debt position, after the impact of hedging as at 30 April 2024 and 2023, with all variables held constant, an  $0.5\%$  change in interest rates is estimated to result in a \ $0.7 million (FY23: \$ 0.7 million) change in the Group's net profit after tax. This sensitivity estimate is driven by higher/ lower interest costs from variable rate cash and bank debt, net of interest rate derivatives that hedge core debt.

These movements have been selected as they are considered reasonable, given the current economic climate and the current levels of short term and long-term Australian interest rates.

# Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments.

# Trade receivables and loans

The Group trades with a large number of customers and it is Group policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. In addition, where a loan has been provided, the Group will obtain security over certain assets of the customer wherever possible.

Receivables and loans are monitored on an ongoing basis and a formal review of all balances occurs every six months to measure impairment losses. As identified in note 4.1, the current level of impairment provision represents  $2.5\%$  (FY23:  $2.9\%$ ) of the Group's receivables and loans.

# Lease receivables

The Group is exposed to credit risk on 'back-to-back' arrangements contained within its property leases where Metcash has subleased properties to retailers. The Group regularly reviews material lease arrangements on an ongoing basis and a formal review of all leases occurs every six months to measure impairment losses. Refer note 4.2 for further details.

# Others

There are no other significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.

# Foreign exchange risk

The Group is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations on transactions and balances in respect of its operations in New Zealand. This operation represents less than  $5\%$  of the Group's total sales revenue and total profit after tax.

In addition, the Group undertakes some foreign currency transactions when purchasing goods and services. The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the risk associated with anticipated purchase commitments denominated in foreign currencies.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

The amount of foreign exchange cover is based on anticipated future purchases in light of current conditions in foreign markets, commitments from customers and experience.

# MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date at which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to fair value.

The fair value of derivative contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments. Derivatives are carried as assets when their fair value is positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative. Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives, except for those that qualify as cash flow hedges, are taken directly to the Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year.

Instruments that meet the strict criteria for hedge accounting are classified as:

fair value hedges, when they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability; or  
- cash flow hedges, when they hedge the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable either to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or to a forecast transaction.

# Fair value hedges

The change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk hedged is recorded as part of the carrying value of the hedged item and is also recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as finance costs. If the hedged item is derecognised, the unamortised fair value is recognised immediately in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

When an unrecognised firm commitment is designated as a hedged item, the subsequent cumulative change in the fair value of the firm commitment attributable to the hedged risk is recognised as an asset or liability with a corresponding gain or loss recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

# Cash flow hedges

The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income and carried forward to the cash flow hedge reserve, while any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as finance costs.

Amounts recognised as other comprehensive income are transferred to profit or loss when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when the hedged financial income or financial expense is recognised or when a forecast sale occurs. When the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the amounts recognised as other comprehensive income are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.

If the forecast transaction or firm commitment is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is transferred to the Statement of Comprehensive Income. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, any cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income remains in other comprehensive income until the forecast transaction or firm commitment affects the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

# Current versus non-current classification

Derivative instruments are classified as current or non-current or separated into current and non-current portions based on an assessment of the facts and circumstances including the underlying contracted cash flows.

# 5.7. Capital management

For the purpose of the Group's capital management, capital includes all accounts classified as equity on the Statement of Financial Position. The Board's intention is to continue to invest in the business for future growth while maintaining a strong financial position and otherwise to assess returning surplus capital to shareholders.

On 24 June 2024, the Board determined to pay a fully franked FY24 final dividend of 8.5 cents per share. The FY24 final dividend represents a full year dividend payout ratio of  $71.0\%$  of underlying profit after tax.

The Board and management set out to maintain appropriate Statement of Financial Position ratios. Certain Statement of Financial Position ratios are also imposed under the Group's banking facilities (refer to note 5.2).

Management monitor capital through the debt leverage ratio (net debt / underlying EBITDA - depreciation of ROU assets). The FY24 debt leverage ratio was  $0.45\mathrm{x}$ , which reflects a low gearing position.

No changes were made to the overall objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during the year.

From their respective dates of acquisition, the businesses acquired during the financial year contributed  $131 million of incremental sales revenue and$ 8.6 million of incremental earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to the Metcash Group.

# Bianco Construction Supplies

In March 2024, Metcash acquired a  $100\%$  ownership interest in Bianco Construction Supplies. Bianco is the leading independent building materials supplier in the South Australian market, servicing builders, concreters, bricklayers, and landscapers from 10 sites.

The acquisition supports Metcash's IHG 'Whole of House' growth strategy which focuses on increasing the proportion of material supplied by IHG in the building of a house (i.e. across the foundations, frame & truss, lock up, fix and fit out steps). It broadens IHG's offer and presence in South Australia and the Northern Territory and provides access to key trades not currently serviced. It is also complementary to Metcash's company owned K&B business in South Australia and other independents in South Australia and Northern Territory.

# Alpine Truss

In March 2024, Metcash acquired a  $100\%$  ownership interest in Alpine Truss. Alpine Truss is one of the largest Frame & Truss operations in Australia and operates a large fabrication plant in Wangaratta, Victoria. The business services small to large volume builders across Victoria and Southern New South Wales.

Frame & Truss is a key element of IHG's 'Whole of House' growth strategy. The acquisition extends IHG's network of Frame & Truss operations across Australia to 24, of which 12 are wholly owned by Metcash or partly owned under joint venture. The acquisition enables access to the previously under-represented Victora and Australian Capital Territory Frame & Truss markets.

# Total Tools JV stores

In FY24, Metcash's Total Tools retail store ownership continued to expand with the acquisition of ownership interests of  $51\%$  in five Total Tools independent retail stores, together with the establishment of two greenfield JV stores. The Total Tools business is a complementary business to our Hardware pillar and forms part of the largest professional tools retail network in Australia.

# Other business combinations

During the year, the Group also entered into a number of other business combinations within the Hardware pillar (five businesses), Food pillar (two businesses) and Liquor pillar (one business) that were not material to the Group, individually.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

# Put and call options written over non-controlling interests

The Group has recognised financial liabilities for the Total Tools JV Store put options and put options in two non-wholly owned subsidiaries within the Hardware pillar at their provisional fair values totalling  $35.2 million and has derecognised the non-controlling interests of$ 12.0 million related to these acquisitions. Details of these put options are set out in note 5.3 of the financial report. As at the date of acquisition, the net amount of $23.2 million has been recognised as an adjustment to retained earnings as shown below:

<table><tr><td></td><td>$m</td></tr><tr><td>Non-controlling interests derecognised (a)</td><td>12.0</td></tr><tr><td>Adjustment recognised directly in equity (retained earnings) (b)</td><td>23.2</td></tr><tr><td>Fair value of put options recognised as a financial liability</td><td>35.2</td></tr></table>

(a) Non-controlling interests (NCI) derecognised of $12.0 million exclude the NCI in Bianco Construction Supplies of $1.1m relating to its 65% ownership interest in Mincon Supplies Pty Ltd.  
(b) In addition to the adjustment referred to in the table above, the Group also recognised a further adjustment in equity of $6.4 million in relation to the reduction in its ownership interest in six Total Tools corporate stores (refer Note 5.3).

Any changes in the value of the put option financial liabilities that occur subsequent to initial recognition will be recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and will be disclosed within significant items. Refer note 3.3 for further details.

The accounting for the above business combinations is provisional as at 30 April 2024.

# MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

# Business combinations

The acquisition of controlled entities is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition method of accounting involves allocating the costs of the business combination to the acquisition date fair value of net assets acquired, including intangible assets, contingent liabilities and contingent consideration.

# Acquisition of non-controlling interests

# Total Tools Holdings (TTH)

In November 2023, Metcash increased its ownership from  $85\%$  to  $100\%$  in TTH, which is the parent entity in the Total Tools Group, following the exercise of a put option by the holders of the minority  $15\%$  ownership interest. The purchase consideration for the remaining  $15\%$  interest of $101.5 million was paid on 30 November 2023 and was accounted for as a reduction in the associated put option liability to nil.

# Total Tools JV Stores

In addition, Metcash has reset its put option arrangements with a number of its Total Tools JV stores. This is to provide JV partners with a balance between receiving some capital upfront and remaining both vested and engaged in the ongoing success of their stores through continued equity interest.

During FY24, Metcash has reset put option arrangements for 11 JV stores by acquiring an additional ownership interest upfront (FY23 ownership interest  $51\%$  -  $60\%$ , up to revised ownership interest  $80\%$  -  $95\%$ ) for purchase consideration of $42.5 million (allocated against the put option liability) and deferring the put option in relation to the residual ownership interest by a further three years.

In conjunction with the above JV reset, Metcash also reduced its ownership interest in 6 corporate stores from an FY23 ownership interest of  $100\%$  to an ownership interest of between  $51\%$  and  $70\%$ , for  $\$9.6$  million sale consideration ( $\$5.5$  million deferred).

In addition, the Group CFO&#x27;s ongoing performance and behaviours must be deemed as acceptable over each performance period by the Board.</td></tr></table>

The STI schemes (deferred component) and LTI schemes are also subject to service conditions, usually from grant date to the date of the allocation of shares.

The FY22-FY24 LTI is expected to vest at  $76.7\%$ . These vested performance rights will be converted to shares and allocated to the participants under the rights plan on 15 August 2024.

As foreshadowed in FY23, the FY21-FY23 LTI plan vested on 15 August 2023 at  $100\%$  which was equivalent to 2,490,012 performance rights. Each performance right entitled the participant to one Metcash share. Metcash acquired 1,793,848 shares on market and allocated these to the participants on 15 August 2023. The balance relating to good leavers was settled in cash.

# Measurement of fair values

# FY24 at-risk STI plan - deferred component

The 40% (Group CEO), 33% (Group CFO) and 25% (other KMP and senior executives) components of the FY24 at-risk STI plan will be deferred and released through the issue of Metcash performance rights conditional upon the executive remaining employed by the Company until 3 July 2025. The number of performance rights will be calculated by dividing 40% (Group CEO), 33% (Group CFO) and 25% (other KMP and senior executives) of the STI award dollar value by the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of Metcash ordinary shares over the 20 trading days ended 30 April 2024 of $3.91 per share. The FY24 expense for the FY24 at-risk STI plan – deferred component has been based on an estimate of the fair value of the performance rights. The fair value per grant was determined in accordance with AASB 2 Share-based payments at grant date.

# FY23 at-risk STI plan - deferred component

The 33% (Group CEO) and 25% (other KMP and senior executives) components of the FY23 at-risk STI plan will be deferred and released through the issue of Metcash performance rights conditional upon the executive remaining employed by the Company until 30 April 2024. The number of performance rights will be calculated by dividing 33% (Group CEO) and 25% (other KMP and senior executives) of the STI award dollar value by the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of Metcash ordinary shares over the 20 trading days ended 30 April 2023 of $3.94 per share. The FY23 expense for the FY23 at-risk STI plan – deferred component has been based on an estimate of the fair value of the performance rights. The fair value per grant was determined in accordance with AASB 2 Share-based payments at grant date.

Service and non-market performance conditions attached to the grants were not taken into account in measuring fair value. Market performance conditions associated with the grants have been reflected in the fair value measurement. Expected volatility is based on an evaluation of the historical volatility of Metcash's share price, particularly over the historical period commensurate with the expected term. Performance rights are only exercisable on their vesting date.

# MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

# Share-based payment transactions

The Group provides a portion of senior executive and key employee remuneration as equity-settled share-based payments, in the form of performance rights.

The value of the performance rights issued is determined on the date which both the employee and the Group understand and agree to the share-based payment terms and conditions (grant date). The value at grant date is based upon the fair value of a similar arrangement between the Group and an independent third party and is determined using an appropriate valuation model. The fair value does not consider the impact of service or performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the share price of Metcash Limited (market conditions).

The fair value of performance rights is recognised as an expense, together with a corresponding increase in the share-based payments reserve within equity, over the period between the grant date and the date on which the employee becomes fully entitled to the award (vesting date). This expense is recognised cumulatively by estimating the number of performance rights expected to vest. This estimate is formed based on the best available information at the reporting date. No adjustment is made for the likelihood of market conditions being met as the effect of these conditions is included in the determination of fair value at grant date. Where the performance rights are cancelled, any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.

The dilutive effect, if any, of outstanding performance rights are reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share.

# Reconciliation of outstanding performance rights

The following table illustrates the movement in the number of performance rights during the year:

<table><tr><td></td><td>FY24
Number</td><td>FY23
Number</td></tr><tr><td>Outstanding at the beginning of the year</td><td>7,064,289</td><td>7,609,890</td></tr><tr><td>Granted during the year</td><td>3,034,578</td><td>2,339,496</td></tr><tr><td>Vested/exercised during the year</td><td>(2,302,875)</td><td>(2,530,339)</td></tr><tr><td>Expired/forfeited during the year</td><td>(2,061,954)</td><td>(354,758)</td></tr><tr><td>Outstanding at the end of the year</td><td>5,734,038</td><td>7,064,289</td></tr></table>

1. The FY22-FY24 LTI performance rights plan is expected to vest at  $76.7\%$  subject only to the employees remaining in employment until 15 August 2024. These vested performance rights will be converted to shares and allocated to the participants under the Rights Plan on 15 August 2024.

Total outstanding at the reporting date 5,734,038

# Key terms and conditions

All performance rights associated with the above schemes are equity-settled performance rights and were issued under the Metcash Executives and Senior Managers Performance Rights Plan (Rights Plan). Fully paid ordinary shares issued under this plan rank equally with all other existing fully paid ordinary shares in respect of voting and dividend rights.

The key terms of the 'LTI' and 'STI plan - deferred component' plans include:

1. Each performance right is an entitlement to receive a fully paid ordinary share in the Company on terms and conditions determined by the Board, including vesting conditions linked to service and performance over the contractual life of the rights;  
2. Performance rights which do not vest are forfeited;  
3. Performance rights are offered at no cost to participants;  
4. Performance rights do not carry voting or dividend rights, however shares allocated upon vesting of performance rights will carry the same rights as other ordinary shares;  
5. Ordinarily, in the event of cessation of employment, unvested performance rights will lapse; however, this is subject to Board discretion, which may be exercised in circumstances including death and disability, retirement, redundancy or special circumstances;  
6. When testing performance conditions, the Board has full discretion in relation to its calculation and to include or exclude items if appropriate, including to better reflect shareholder expectations or management performance;  
7. Some or all of a participant's performance rights may vest even if a performance condition has not been satisfied, if, using its discretion, the Board considers that to do so would be in the interests of the Group; and  
8. If there is a change in control of the Group, the Board retains full discretion to vest or lapse some or all performance rights.

# Financial guarantee contracts

The Group has granted a financial guarantee contract relating to the bank loan of a joint venture, Adcome Pty Ltd (Cornetts). Under the contract, the bank has the right to require Metcash to repay the debt under certain prescribed circumstances of default. The estimate of the maximum amount payable in respect of the guarantee, if exercised, is  $40.0 million (FY23:$ 40.0 million).

Had the guarantee been exercised at 30 April 2024, the amount payable would have been  $17.2 million (FY23:$ 25.2 million). The fair value of the financial guarantee contract at the reporting date was $0.3 million (FY23: $0.9 million) and is recognised as a financial liability.

# Put options

Put options, including in relation to Ritchies Stores Pty Ltd, are detailed along with other contingent liabilities in note 5.3 of the financial statements.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED

# 7.4. Subsequent events

On 3 June 2024, Metcash announced that completion had occurred in relation to the acquisition of a  $100\%$  ownership interest in SFG Group Holdings Pty Ltd ('Superior Foods'). Superior Foods is a leading Australian foodservice distribution business in the large and growing foodservice market. The acquisition delivers immediate scale and growth opportunities in the adjacent foodservice market and further strengthens and diversifies our existing Food business. The purchase price for the acquisition comprises an enterprise value of up to $412.3 million ($390.0 million fixed and paid at completion, plus a potential Group Earn-Out payment of up to $22.3 million) plus/minus certain other customary adjustments in relation to net debt and working capital, which are expected to be finalised in October 2024.

Other than the matters disclosed in this report, there were no events that have occurred after the end of the financial year that would materially affect the reported results or would require disclosure in this report.

# Independent auditor's report to the members of Metcash Limited

# Report on the audit of the financial report

# Opinion

We have audited the financial report of Metcash Limited (the Company) and its subsidiaries (collectively the Group), which comprises the consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 April 2024, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, notes to the financial statements, including material accounting policy information, and the directors' declaration.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial report of the Group is in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, including:

a. Giving a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 30 April 2024 and of its consolidated financial performance for the year ended on that date; and  
b. Complying with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Regulations 2001.

# Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial report section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board's APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the Code) that are relevant to our audit of the financial report in Australia. We have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

# Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial report of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, but we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.

We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial report section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying financial report.

# Impairment assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/0c5583bd-e43c-4059-9d30-f0f24e0016e2/59e28ad49fc1d02f1efa98ba9b35f07d0c0f11cd8664f031d901b2b08e1b1848.jpg)

# Why significant

At 30 April 2024, the Group's consolidated statement of financial position includes goodwill and other intangible assets with a carrying value  $1,061.5 million, representing \(18.3\%$  of total assets. The Group recognised \)160.8 million in goodwill arising from business acquisitions during the year.

The directors have assessed goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment. As disclosed within Note 4.7 to the financial statements, the assessment of the impairment of the Group's goodwill and other intangible assets incorporated significant judgments and estimates, based upon conditions existing as at 30 April 2024, specifically concerning factors such as forecast cashflows, discount rates and terminal growth rates.

The estimates and assumptions relate to the sustainability of future performance, market and economic conditions. Significant assumptions used in the impairment testing referred to above are inherently subjective.

The disclosures in the financial report provide important information about the assumptions made in the impairment testing and the market conditions at 30 April 2024.

Accordingly, we considered the impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets and the related disclosures in the financial report to be a key audit matter.

# How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Our audit procedures included the following:

Assessed the Group's determination of the cash generating units (CGUs) used in the impairment model, based on our understanding of the nature of the Group's business and the economic environment in which the segments operate. We also considered internal reporting of the Group's results to assess how earnings and goodwill are monitored and reported.  
Assessed the Group's allocation of additional goodwill arising from business combinations to CGUs used in the impairment model.  
Assessed the cash flow forecasts, assumptions and estimates used by the Group, as outlined in Note 4.7 to the financial statements, by considering the reliability of the Group's historical cash flow forecasts, our knowledge of the business and corroborating data with external information where possible.  
Considered the impact on the cash flow forecasts related to the group's climate change commitments.  
Evaluated the appropriateness of discount and terminal growth rates applied with involvement from our valuation specialists.  
Tested the mathematical accuracy of the impairment testing models including the consistency of relevant data with latest Board approved forecasts.  
Performed sensitivity analysis on key assumptions including growth rates (including terminal growth rates) and discount rates, for each of the Group's CGUs.  
Assessed the adequacy of the financial report disclosures contained in Note 4.7.

# EY

# Building a better working world

# Accounting for Rebates

# Why significant

Note 4.3 of the financial report outlines the Group's accounting policy relating to supplier rebates, or supplier income as they are referred to in the financial report.

The Group receives rebates and other similar incentives from suppliers which are determined based upon a number of measures which can include volumes of inventory purchased or sold and the performance of promotional activities.

We considered this to be a key audit matter as supplier rebates contributed significantly to the Group's results. There are a large number of specific agreements in place and some of the arrangements require judgment to be applied in determining the timing of rebate recognition and the appropriate classification within the financial statements, based upon the terms of the agreement.

# How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Our audit procedures included the following:

Evaluated the Group's design of controls relating to the recognition, measurement and classification of rebate amounts recognised within the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.  
Assessed the operating effectiveness of relevant controls in place relating to the recognition and measurement of selected purchase-volume based rebates.  
Selected a sample of non purchase-volume based and purchase-volume based rebates, and determined whether the rebates were calculated in accordance with the agreed terms and assessed whether the timing and value of amounts recognised were in accordance with the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.  
Selected a sample of supplier rebates recorded as receivables at year-end and assessed whether the income was correctly calculated and recognised in the correct period.  
Considered the Group's assessment of the value of rebates associated with inventory on hand at year end that were deducted from the carrying value of inventory.  
Considered the impact of supplier claims during and subsequent to year end on amounts recognised.  
Inquired of the Group as to the existence of any non-standard agreements or side arrangements.

The other information comprises the information included in the Group's 2024 Annual Report other than the financial report and our auditor's report thereon. We obtained the directors' report that is to be included in the Annual Report, prior to the date of this auditor's report, and we expect to obtain the remaining sections of the Annual Report after the date of this auditor's report.

Our opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon, with the exception of the Remuneration Report and our related assurance opinion.

In connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial report or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

# Building a better working world

If, based on the work we have performed on the other information obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of the directors for the financial report

The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters relating to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

# Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial report

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.

As part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

$\triangleright$  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.  
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.  
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.  
Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.  
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the disclosures, and whether the financial report represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.  
Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

From the matters communicated to the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial report of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# Report on the audit of the Remuneration Report

# Opinion on the Remuneration Report

We have audited the Remuneration Report included in pages 51 to 66 of the Directors' report for the year ended 30 April 2024.

In our opinion, the Remuneration Report of Metcash Limited for the year ended 30 April 2024, complies with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001.

# Responsibilities

The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Remuneration Report in accordance with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Remuneration Report, based on our audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards.
