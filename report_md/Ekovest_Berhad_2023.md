# STATEMENT

DEAR VALUED SHAREHOLDERS, ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF EKOVEST BERHAD, IWOULD LIKE TO PRESENT TO YOU OUR ANNUAL REPORT AND THE GROUP'S REPORTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2023.

# INDUSTRY TRENDS

The growth momentum in the construction industry in Malaysia is expected to continue to grow steadily in 2023. The growth in the construction sector is driven by the full resumption of activities across all subsectors. In the civil engineering subsector, growth is expected to recover in line with the government's focus on completing large infrastructure projects and increased investment on industrial and energy projects. The construction sector continued to expand in the second quarter of 2023, rising by 8.1 per cent to record RM32.4 billion value of work done according to the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM), this is supported by further improving economic conditions.

The civil engineering subsector is anticipated to regain its positive growth, following the continuation and acceleration of major infrastructure projects, such as Light Rail Transit Line 3 (LRT3), Mass Rail Transit Line 3 (MRT3), Johor-Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) as well as the Pan Borneo highways in Sabah and Sarawak. Utility projects, including Baleh Hydroelectric, Sarawak Water Supply Grid Programme and Large-Scale Solar 3 plant, are also projected to spur growth. Similarly, the residential buildings subsector is expected to expand further in line with the Government's measures to address the shortage of affordable houses. The measures, among others, are the continuation of the Rent-to-Own scheme and full stamp duty exemptions for first-time home buyers as well as Rumah Mesra Rakyat and People's Housing programmes. In addition, the non-residential buildings subsector is anticipated to improve, backed by ongoing commercial projects, namely Kwasa Damansara, Tun Razak Exchange and KLIA Aeropolis.

Malaysia's property sector poised for sustainable growth in 2023. During this 1st half year 2023, Malaysia's economy continues its strong growth momentum, underpinned by strong pick-up in domestic demand, improving labour market conditions as well as favourable policy support. As compared to 2022, the property sector due to waning demand, high cost of materials and increase in interest rates which has a negative impact on the demand for properties. In 2022, new launches were scale back due to higher raw material and labour costs while weakening consumer sentiment caused by inflationary pressures were expected to dampen consumer spending. Despite prevailing subdued market sentiments, the Malaysia property market performed modestly than expected in 2022. Demand remains strong despite cautious consumer sentiments, and the current climate of rich incentives introduced by the government presents attractive property opportunities for those on good financial footing. The property market is expected to regain its momentum in 2023 though the environment remained challenging.

Growth in the agriculture sector is expected to expand, primarily due to a recovery in oil palm production. Slightly higher-than-average rainfall in the beginning of the year due to the La Nina phenomenon is expected to improve oil palm yields particularly towards the later part of the year.

According to the Malaysia Economic Monitor: Weathering the Surge report by the World Bank, the ongoing pandemic and movement restrictions will continue to affect Malaysia's economy in the near term. The current resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the movement control order (MCO) reimposition is expected to significantly impact private consumption. The ongoing MCOs increased precautionary behaviour and subdued wage growth are all expected to exert negative pressure on private consumption activity.

# GROUP EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT

# FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

Throughout the past year, we remained committed to implementing our strategy to transform Ekovest into a larger listed conglomerate with a portfolio of diversified businesses to reduce dependency on our existing businesses in construction, property development and toll operations in the ever-changing and uncertain landscape. We are now intensely focused on cultivating growth drivers for our businesses, and rejuvenating key management teams to drive us forward. Notwithstanding the challenges faces in financial year ended 30 June 2023 ("FYE2023"), Ekovest Berhad ("Ekovest") and its subsidiaries (the "Group") have managed to adapt and will continue to draw lessons to continue our effort to drive operational and cost efficiency throughout all business segment within the Group.

In FYE2023, Ekovest registered revenue of RM1.117 billion, an increase of approximately  $38.1\%$  as compared to revenue of RM808.5 million achieved in the previous financial year ended 30 June 2022 ("FYE2022"). Our construction division continues to be the main revenue driver, contributing RM527.0 million or  $47.2\%$  of total revenue, while our toll operations remained the second largest contributor with RM287.7 million or  $25.8\%$ . Our property development division contributed RM139.1 million or  $12.5\%$  and the plantation division had contributed RM118.3 million or  $10.6\%$  to the total revenue achieved in FYE2023.

The increase in revenue was mainly attributable to the increase in construction activities from the commencement of the new Rapid Transit System Link ("RTS Link") project during this FYE2023. The revenue from the sales of the completed residential units in EkoCheras has gradually increased after the government lifted the MCO restrictions with the sales from the property development division had also further improved after obtaining approval for the release of unsold Bumiputera units at EkoCheras in September 2022. With the "Transition to Endemic" phase, we are looking into the development planning to take into consideration post pandemic lifestyle and spending pattern. Our toll operations division reported a growth in terms of revenue, its operations has improved with the higher traffic volume throughout FYE2023 as the movement controls were lifted. The Loss Before Tax ("LBT") for FYE2023 stood at RM9.9 million, decreased compared to the LBT reported in FYE2022 of RM40.5 million which is in tandem with the increase in revenue. However, with the deferred tax expenses amounting to RM81.3 million mainly from our toll operation division has resulted in Loss After Tax ("LAT") of RM109.4 million in FYE2023 as compared to a LAT of RM123.4 million in FYE2022.

# STRATEGIC REVIEW

These plans that we have implemented is part of our strategy to transform Ekovest into a larger listed conglomerate with a larger portfolio of diversified businesses and is in line with the long-term strategy of expanding and diversifying into other businesses to reduce dependency and reliance on our existing businesses in construction, property development and toll operations. Our strategic focus is to put us in a strong position to benefit from longer-term growth. Our hybrid business model creates long-term shareholders' value by harnessing the benefits of our complementary businesses - construction, property development, plantation and highway concession. This model limits the impact of economic cycles and allows us to prioritise high-quality businesses, in order to improve margins and deliver disciplined revenue growth.

With the "Transition to Endemic", FYE2023 is a challenging year but we have remained focused on delivering sustainable growth and long-term shareholders' value. We will continue to take appropriate and deliberate actions to drive performance while maintaining financial prudency. We will continue to navigate our way through the challenges to promote and grow the Group's various businesses. We are committed to improving the construction industry and we understand the wider impact that our businesses can achieve to support the development of the nation through the delivery of sustainable quality in our buildings, roads, public spaces, infrastructure and other construction areas. The contracts that we have secured, specifically the Johor Bahru to Singapore Rapid Transit System Link Rail connecting Johor Bahru and Singapore, will augur well for our construction division and we will continue to focus and engage with the Government on new projects which we have submitted, including DUKE Phase 2A project. Upon the upliftment of the MCO, the Group has experienced steady increase in toll revenue for Duke Phase 1 and Phase 2 and the upcoming full opening of the Setiawangsa - Pantai Expressway ("SPE") will further increase the revenue for our toll operations segment.

We have also taken steps to grow further and have taken a bolder step to invest in a property development project in Singapore. We will use this investment and experience gained to be the yardstick to measure our technical capabilities and to ascertain if we have what it takes to compete at international level.

Our subsidiary, PLS Plantations Berhad ("PLS"), is in a transition phase from its core business in traditional oil palm plantation to the broader agrofood industry. PLS's transformation journey from the cyclical oil palm plantation to a more diversified range of upstream and downstream activities will require a longer gestation period. In particular, the gestation period for the durian trees is about 4 to 5 years and thus, the bulk of our durian revenues is only from trading activities. In the near term, while PLS's oil palm business is

# STRATEGIC REVIEW (CONT'D)

expected to see improved productivity and yield with the recent availability of labour, the selling price of fresh fruit bunches ("FFB") may remain less buoyant than the previous financial year. PLS has also entered into various cash crops joint ventures for the purpose of intercropping with cash crops, durian and other plantations. We have set our sight in the durian business as this is an industry waiting to be harnessed as it is in the midst of transformation from being a small stakeholder business to a commercialised industry. There are proper plans and foundations being laid to enhance this area of business and provide fruitful returns to the Group in the medium to long term horizon.

To strengthen the achievement of the company strategy as mentioned above, on 27 September 2023, in my personal capacity as a major shareholder of Ekovest, I have served a letter of proposal to convey my intention to undertake a reorganisation, rationalisation and merger proposal to transform the enlarged Ekovest group into a listed public-private-partnership conglomerate in Malaysia, with interests in construction, property development, infrastructure and plantations. My proposals are intended to streamline the businesses and to consolidate the assets, resources, capabilities and core strengths of the respective companies in order to strengthen the performance, competitiveness and sustainability of the enlarged conglomerate, which I believe will create value for the all shareholders.

Furthermore, the proposals are aimed at mitigating any potential conflict of interest and it is my goal to share the economic propositions and benefits that I have for my business assets with all my minority shareholders. In issuing this letter, I am seeking to be completely transparent with the Board of Directors relating to my intention and vision for Ekovest and to consider the proposal, if thought fit implement them. The enlarged conglomerate through Ekovest post completion of the various proposed corporate exercises will have a stronger financial position, assets portfolio, vast strategic landbank as well as the skill and expertise required to compete both locally and internationally.

# APPRECIATIONS

On behalf of the Board of Directors and Management, I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to Dr. Wong Kai Fatt, Mr Chow Yoon Sam and Ms Kang Hui Ling, who have been a part of this remarkable journey and have been serving Ekovest Group over the years. To our dedicated board members, thank you for your visionary leadership, invaluable guidance, relentless commitment and contributions to Ekovest. Also, let me take this opportunity to welcome Dato' Majid Manjit Bin Abdullah, Mr Chin Wai Kit and Ms Jasmine Cheong Chi-May as our new Independent Non-Executive Directors.

Next, I wish to express my most sincere appreciation to our senior management team who has been working tirelessly to propel the Group to new heights and my personal gratitude to all employees of Ekovest Group for their dedication and commitment. Thank you to all our customers, clients, business associates, bankers and the various government and local authorities for their continuing support and confidence in our Group's ability to deliver projects that was entrusted to us.

Last but not least, thank you to our esteemed shareholders for your trust, patience, and continuous confidence in our Company. The Board remained optimistic in delivering positive financial results. We hold the responsibility that you have entrusted to us in high regard and we shall endeavour to deliver an even better financial year ended 2024. We look forward to a very exciting year ahead for the Ekovest Group.

# MANAGING

# DIRECTOR'S

# STATEMENT

We are relieved that Malaysia's economy is heading to a rebound post pandemic and with the end of movement controls restrictions, our business activities and operations are recovering as well. Despite the promising economic situation, our financial year ended 30 June 2023 ("FYE2023") has remained to be a challenging year. The economic framework announced by the Government recently which was aimed at boosting the Malaysian economy has returned investors' confidence in Malaysia and has provided comfort that we are on the right track and look forward to capitalise on the recovery of the economy.

# Construction

# Delivering Infrastructure Milestone

During FYE2023, we have continued to focus on the full completion of our Setiawangsa - Pantai Expressway ("SPE") despite the many challenges faced throughout the construction period. Nonetheless, the long-term effects post pandemic, especially challenges in the construction supply chain resulting in unpredictable fluctuation material prices and tight labour market, had previously hampered the progress. We also had to deal and resolve several on-site issues since commencement of its construction that has impacted the overall work progress, aggravated by the new health and safety protocols and procedures post COVID-19. Despite the challenges faced, the SPE's Section 4 (Taman Melati to Setiawangsa Interchange) was opened to public on 22 December 2021. The remaining sections of the SPE has been issued its certificate of practical completion and is currently under inspection from Government authorities. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, we expect the SPE to be fully opened to public in the early 4th quarter calendar year 2023.

# MANAGING DIRECTOR'S STATEMENT

# Construction Delivering Infrastructure Milestone (Cont'd)

Construction have always been the forte of our company and we expect this to remain the same in the years to come. We had delivered more than RM8 billion worth of construction projects to clients all across Malaysia and pride ourselves for being one of the most respected construction players in Malaysia.

![](images/451b2d84da3b2314ad41ed6ad0305e2563f794092bedf4c1c57091316a3136ed.jpg)

Looking forward, the RM1.45 billion engineering, procurement and construction contract for the RTS Link project has enabled the Group to replenish its construction order book and this is expected to contribute positively to the financial performance of the Group for the next two (2) financial years. Upon the completion of these high-impact infrastructure projects, it will mark another milestone of the projects that we have been trusted with and delivered for the nation.

We still believe that the current infrastructure development model adopted by the Government of Malaysia via Private Public Partnership (PPP) is still relevant and will help accelerate future infrastructure needs in Malaysia. In addition, we are pursuing and actively looking for new opportunities, including the DUKE Phase 2A to secure more infrastructure projects to replenish our construction orderbook.

# MANAGING DIRECTOR'S STATEMENT

# Property Development and Property Investment Post Pandemic Recovery

Our property development division had performed better than previous years with higher sales of completed residential units at EkoCheras with sales further improving after obtaining approval for the release of unsold "Bumiputera" units in September 2022. In addition, we are finalising the financial requirement and the authorities' submission for the launch of the upcoming new property development, the EkoTitiwangsa project in the 4th quarter calendar year 2023. EkoTitiwangsa consists of one office tower and two blocks of service apartments and has an estimated GDV of RM500.11 million to cater for lifestyle and spending habits post pandemic. We will continue to explore the right opportunities to monetise our other landbanks which will contribute to both the property development and construction segment simultaneously.

Our EkoCheras Mall have continued its road to recovery past pandemic where we were faced with tough decision and had to discontinue or terminate some tenants. We had been very accommodative and supportive towards our tenants to ensure their business is able to recover into normalcy after a long period of uncertainty during the pandemic. We have continued with our rebates assistance, although at a much lower level compared to the peak of the pandemic and continuing support to the tenants in various other forms. The management remains very optimistic on the long-term performance of the mall.

Our EkoCheras integrated development comprises a mall, a hotel, an office tower and three blocks of serviced apartments have been fully completed with the final opening of the hotel operations. We have appointed Spain's largest hotel chain, Meliá Hotels International, as the operator of the 238-room hotel at EkoCheras. The Innside by Meliá has opened its doors to the public since March 2023.

Overall, we believe that the entire EkoCheras development is able to offer an affordable yet comfortable experience and will be the nucleus of Cheras. We hope that EkoCheras will be able to open up more growth opportunities and rejuvenate Cheras as a whole.

# MANAGING DIRECTOR'S STATEMENT

# Infrastructure Concession

# Long Term Asset In Greater Kuala Lumpur

Our infrastructure concession and toll operation division (i.e. the operation and management of the DUKE toll concession) has recovered well and traffic volumes have returned to pre-Covid levels. In early the first quarter of 2023, traffic volumes have exceeded the pre-pandemic levels and this trend is expected to continue. We are now focused to ensure the comfort of road users remain at a high level to entice them to utilise our alternative highway network. We are also ensuring that the long-term maintenance of the expressway is kept within the standards set by the MHA.

![](images/34ae469e2809b82f47f8190cad18190dcd6a23dc93919319bb5d584566ec8027.jpg)

Nonetheless, although troubled times for traffic volume may be over, we should not forget the lasting impact the COVID-19 pandemic had, especially on the cashflow and overall financial commitment we have to our sukukholders. The lost opportunity for toll collection since March 2020 to October 2021 have created a huge financial gap between projected and actual toll collection. Nonetheless, we remain positive to be able to meet all principal and profit payment, as and when due, but require the support and patience of all stakeholders to recover and realign our financial covenant obligations. Our industry peers have also continued with the engagement with the Government to highlight the severity of the reduced traffic volume resulting from the MCO implemented to the overall business model as well as to the liquidity and cashflow position of all concessionaires in Malaysia. Any adverse impact to the toll industry will have a ripple-effect to the capital markets whereby there are more than RM60.0 billion of outstanding debt and/or sukuk raised by the industry.

The anticipated full opening of the SPE in the 4th quarter calendar year 2023 and also the opening of the Sungai Besi - Ulu Kelang Elevated Expressway (SUKE) together with the Damansara - Shah Alam Elevated Expressway (DASH) will further enhance the entire road network in Greater Kuala Lumpur. This is especially important for us as the seamless integration between our DUKE and these expressways will provide the impetus required for increased traffic volumes utilising our DUKE.

Nevertheless, the long-term prospect and value of the DUKE is still present as the seamless connectivity it provides will see it become an important road link and network for Greater Kuala Lumpur. The long concession period which we have for this urban highway also provide flexibility for potential future monetisation and value enhancements.

# Strengthening Presence in Agriculture & Agrofood

PLS, a leading player in the agro-food industry, their implementation of the business strategy and transformation plan is in a transition phase. In addition to diversifying the business into different cash crops, PLS are also building distribution channels and diversifying into downstream products, specifically into durian consumer products. The rolling out of their Agropreneur Programme, an Integrated Agrotech Park and collaboration with both the Federal and State Government and ecosystem partners will be the backbone to strengthening their role in the local agro-food ecology and network. PLS has also sets its sights on refining its approach to the Chinese market as their previous strategy of direct selling to China, primarily through exports, encountered challenges. PLS is recalibrating to form collaborations with renowned players in China's wholesale and retail sectors instead of the earlier direct selling strategy. PLS is currently engaged in discussions with multiple stakeholders to enhance its access to the Chinese market. The aim of this collaboration is to align interests and foster sustainable growth for PLS, allowing the PLS to maintain its core expertise in planting, sourcing and downstream processing. Barring unforeseen circumstances and the favourable commodity prices,

we expect this division to contribute positively in the coming years.

# Management Discussion And Analysis

The total revenue reported for FYE2023 is RM1.117 billion, which is an increase of approximately  $38.1\%$  as compared to previous year. Tabulation on the revenue for the Ekovest Group in financial year ended FYE2023 and financial year ended 30 June 2022 ("FYE2022") is as below:-

The increase in the current financial year revenue as compared to FYE2022 was mainly contributed by the increase in construction work done during the year due to more construction activities undertaken during this financial year. The higher construction revenue is mainly attributable to RTS Link project in this current financial year 2023 and also workdone from SPE project.

# Management Discussion And Analysis (Cont'd)

Notwithstanding the overall increase in revenue, we had reported increase in revenue in other divisions, mainly by sales income from property development EkoCheras, the increase in traffic volume and toll revenue from the DUKE as well higher revenue from the food and beverages division as well. The property development division reported an increase in revenue from the improved sales of the completed properties in EkoCheras. The increase in the property investment segment is primarily attributed to lower rental rebates granted to tenants at EkoCheras Shopping Mall. In addition, the newly opened Innside by Melia Hotel in EkoCheras has commenced the hotel operations in the last quarter of FYE 2023 and had contributed to the financial performance of this division.

Our infrastructure concession division registered a revenue of RM287.7 million in FYE2023 as compared to RM191.7 million in FYE2022 supported by the increase in traffic volume utilising the DUKE highway. From actual FYE2023 vs FYE2022 toll collection receipts, there is an increase of approximately  $3.5\%$  in the toll revenue, largely due to the increase in the traffic volume in the second half of FYE2023.

The plantation division registered a lower revenue of RM118.3 million in FYE2023 as compared with the revenue of RM167.2 million in FYE2022. The decline in revenue was attributed to moderated crude palm oil prices, inflationary pressures on operational costs, and the lingering effects of adverse weather on durian production where the

volume and quality of durian plantation and contract farming activities were adversely affected by inclement weather condition. Furthermore, the challenges in the past year were compounded by an increase in maintenance activities as the labour supply began its recovery, coupled with a slower offtake of our downstream durian products by export customers.

The Group's total gross profit for FYE2023 has increased as compared to FYE2022 which is in tandem with the increase in total revenue. This has resulted a lower loss before tax ("LBT") for FYE2023 which stood at RM9.9 million as compared with the LBT reported in FYE2022 of RM40.5 million.

However, the Group reported a net loss after tax of RM109.3 million in FYE2023, this is mainly due to the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for the toll operations' segment. The deferred tax expense amounting to RM87.2 million arising from our toll operations division had impacted the net loss after tax of the Group. This is mainly due to unrecognition of the deferred tax assets accumulated unabsorbed business losses pursuant to Section 44(5F) of the Income Tax Act (which the new law has imposed a 10-year limitation and can no longer carried forward indefinitely), as it not probable that the existing toll operation business would generate sufficient taxable profit within the next 10-year against which the deferred tax asset can be utilised.

# MANAGING DIRECTOR'S STATEMENT

# Management Discussion And Analysis (Cont'd)

From the balance sheet perspective, we have seen an increase in our Concession Assets from RM7.3 billion in FYE2022 to RM7.7 billion in the current year which is due to construction progress of the DUKE Phase 3. Correspondingly, there is a decrease in our Investment Funds, Short Term Deposits and Cash and Bank Balances from RM925.0 million in FYE2022 to RM675.3 million in FYE2023, which was due to funds utilised for the construction and financing requirements of DUKE Phase 3. Overall, our capital expenditure and working capital requirements were financed from internal generated cash as well as borrowings from financial institutions. Moving forward, we expect this strategy to remain largely intact and will continue to look for project financing structure to ensure the borrowings risk is "ring-fenced" and kept at project level. In addition, to further strengthen the balance sheet and financial standing of the Ekovest Group, we have also completed a Private Placement in September 2023 comprising of 269,582,800 new ordinary shares in Ekovest and has raised a total of RM117.3 million.

We do acknowledge that some of the projects that we participate in, requires the support and financial capability of the Ekovest Group to be commercially viable. The gearing ratio of the Group remains low at 0.37 times for the FYE2023 vis-à-vis the gearing ratio of 0.40 times in FYE2022. For the calculation of the gearing ratio, we have excluded the Islamic Medium-Term Notes and Reimbursable Interest Assistance, which was issued to finance the construction of the DUKE highway. The slight decrease in the gearing ratio is due to repayment of our borrowings. The net assets per share attributable to equity holders as at FYE2023 had decrease to RM0.86 from RM0.89 in FYE2022, which is mainly due to the net loss recorded in FYE2023.

# ANTI-CORRUCTION AND BRIBERY

The Board and management are committed to promoting bribery and a corruption-free business environment.

The Group Anti-Bribery and Corruption Framework and Policy was developed and put in place in accordance with the Guidelines of Adequate Procedures, which was issued by the government pursuant to the S17A(5) of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act 2009. The objective of this framework and policy is to provide guidance to staff members, employees and business associates in taking appropriate measures and steps to foster bribery and corruption-free business practices.

Management conducted a corruption risk assessment to evaluate the adequacy of the corruption and bribery preventive measures and risk. In this assessment, the potential exposures associated with the occasions and interactions with stakeholders, the frequency of interactions, and the use of agents, consultants, gifts and entertainment are considered vis-à-vis the existing anti-corruption measures. Additional action plans are identified to strengthen the bribery and corruption preventive defence.

In addition, the Board established the Corporate Code of Conduct and Ethics and Whistleblowing Policy to promote integrity and transparency in the Group. These policies are posted on the Company's website for public reference, aim to provide guidance to staff members, employees and business associates in complying with the policies and encouraging stakeholders to report suspected violations such as conflicts of interest, abuse of power, corruption, bribery, insider trading and money laundering.

# LABOR PRACTICES

At Ekovest, we believe the growth of our business is dependent on the career growth and well-being of our employees. Hence, we practice fair employment and maintain a work culture where our employees are respected and given the opportunities to perform.

We prohibit and condemn forced labour, human trafficking, and modern slavery in employment and do not discriminate against our employees based on race, age, gender, religion, marital status, ethnicity, physical impairments, political viewpoints, or nationality. Recruitment, remuneration, promotion, and benefits are evaluated based on objective assessment and meritocracy.

The top management conducts engagement sessions fortnightly with the respective business heads and promotes similar engagement to be cascaded down in their management teams.

Career progression is discussed with our employees to pave the way for assuming higher positions and more responsibilities. Annually, employee remuneration schemes are assessed to ensure that compensation and benefits are in line with the industry in order to retain and attract talent. Also, discretionary incentives are granted to eligible employees based on their performance and contributions to the Group.

We maintained approximately  $72\%$  of our staff strength as full-time employees in FYE2023. Our headcount increased by  $25\%$  from 567 employees in FYE2022 to 710 employees in FYE2023.

Employees are given the opportunity to upgrade and improve their skills and knowledge through formal and on-the-job training programmes. Training programmes are provided based on the employees' skill and knowledge gaps, roles and responsibilities.

# SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENT

# SUSTAINABLE CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT

As one of the leading construction companies in Malaysia involved in major civil engineering, infrastructure and building works, we are proud to be at the forefront of championing the application of sustainable construction management. These applications include:

- The Construction Design and Management approach, a practice that embeds health and safety considerations during the project execution at the design stage;  
- The use of the precast structures, selection of high-performance material, and standardisation of structure elements allow not only the reused formwork but also improve efficiency and sustainability;  
- The parapet wall design enhancement from precast to cast in situ and the use of the safety platform for casting the deck slab to overcome the risk of precast panel collapse;  
- The application of reducing, reusing and recycling waste at the construction sites and reusing on-site building materials such as reusable prefabricated formwork for columns, walls and slabs;  
- The implementation of ISO14001:2015 on Environmental Management System, the Environmental Monitoring and Measurement Control Plan and Environmental Impact Assessment to identify and mitigate environmental impacts;  
- The implementation of the Environmental Management Plan addressing the recommendations identified in the environmental risk assessment for the projects undertaken;  
- Provision of training to our employees to enhance their knowledge in maintaining the environmental management system and meeting the compliance requirements;  
- Ensuring all vehicles, plants, and equipment are maintained in good working condition to reduce wear and tear that can increase air and noise pollution; and  
- Planning and limiting the movement of heavy vehicles in the daytime, installing noise barriers and limiting night work at sites.

Ekovest pioneered using BH Girders, a sustainable construction method in Malaysia, as the beams for bridge structures. In 2021, the Company was awarded by the Malaysia Book of Records for having the "longest T-shaped beam bridge span" in the country at 67.5 meters long. Using a BH Girder increases the span lengths by  $30\%$ , making it suitable for construction involving river crossings and congested urban areas. Also, the increase in the pier spacings caused fewer public disturbances during construction.

Throughout the 2023 financial year, the construction operation did not receive a summon. It conformed with the Environmental Quality Act 1974 and all relevant regulations on the prevention, abatement, control of pollution, air and water emission and waste management.

During the financial year, the total water and electricity consumed in the construction and highway business segment were 68,292 litres and 15,378.01 gigajoules.

# SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENT

# DIVERSITY

As explained under the labour practice, we do not discriminate against our employees based on race, age, gender, religion, marital status, ethnicity, physical impairments, political viewpoints, or nationality. However, the construction and highway business segments are male-dominated due to their inherent job nature. In FYE2023, the employees gender composition of the Group was  $61\%$  male and  $39\%$  female. A similar composition was recorded in FYE2022.

The gender profile by age and employee category as of 30 June 2023 are summarised as follows.

# BOARD LEADERSHIP AND EFFECTIVENESS

# (II) BOARD RESPONSIBILITIES

The Board understands its principal responsibilities in overseeing management performance and corporate strategies, promoting good governance and risk management, and ensuring effective succession planning and investor relation and corporate reporting of the Group.

Presently, the positions of the Executive Chairman and Managing Director are separated. The Chairman instills good governance practices, leadership and effectiveness of the Board by leading and navigating the Group's business directions and chairing the board meetings. In contrast, the key responsibilities of the Managing Director are to lead the management team in planning, executing and managing the businesses and operations in the Group.

The Board is supported by two qualified and competent Company Secretaries. The Company Secretaries are members of the Malaysian Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators. The Company Secretaries advise the Board regarding compliance with regulatory requirements, guidelines, legislations and the principles of best corporate governance practices. The decisions for appointment and removal of Company Secretaries rest with the Board.

The Board has defined and formalised the Code of Conduct and Ethics ("this Code"). This Code prohibits conflicts of interest, abuse of power, corruption, insider trading and money laundering and the expected actions to be taken and the responsibilities of the Board, Management and staff members towards this Code.

The Board has established the Anti-Corruption and Bribery Policy, Whistleblowing Policy and reporting channel. The Whistleblowing and Anti-Corruption and Bribery Policies are available on the Company's website. To protect the confidentiality of information and identity of the whistleblower, the Board has assigned the administration of the whistleblowing reporting channel to the Internal Auditor. During the financial year, the Board did not receive any complaints of violation from these whistleblowing reporting channels.

The Board has established Board Committees, namely the Audit and Risk Management Committee, Nomination Committee and Remuneration Committee. The roles, duties and responsibilities of the Board Committees are defined in its terms of reference respectively. These Committees provide greater objectivity and independence in the deliberations of specific agendas and assist the Board in effectively discharging its duties and responsibilities.

# EFFECTIVE AUDIT AND RISK MANAGEMENT

# (I) AUDIT AND RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE ("ARMC")

Presently, the Audit and Risk Management Committee ("ARMC") members comprise independent Non-Executive Directors. Mr. Chin Wai Kit was appointed as the Chair of ARMC on 1 June 2023 following the departure of Ms. Kang Hui Ling, who has served the Board for more than four terms as an Independent Director.

Most ARMC members are financially literate and understand matters under the purview of the ARMC. The review of the terms of office and performance of the ARMC and its members are carried out annually. The ARMC's composition, functions and activities are set out separately under ARMC Report in this Annual Report.

The policy on the assessment of External Auditors is defined in the ARMC's terms of reference. Annually, the ARMC also reviews the appointment, performance and remuneration of the External Auditors before recommending them to the shareholders for re-appointment in the Annual General Meeting. In assessing the External Auditors, the ARMC will consider the adequacy of the firm's resources, quality of service and competency of the staff assigned to the audit, as well as the auditors' independence and fee. As part of the ARMC review processes, the ARMC will obtain written assurance from the External Auditors confirming that they are, and have been, independent throughout the conduct of the audit engagement in accordance with the terms of all relevant professional and regulatory requirements.

The ARMC will convene meetings with the External Auditors and Internal Auditors without the presence of the Executive Directors and employees of the Group if needed to allow the Auditors to exchange their views freely with the AMRC.

# (II) RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL

The Board is responsible for overall oversight of risk management in the Group, while the Executive Directors and senior management team are primarily responsible for managing risks in the Group.

The Group recorded a further improvement in revenue after the upliftment of pandemic restrictions in 2021. To take advantage of this recovery further, in addition to strengthening the order books for the construction and sales in other business segments, the Group works closely with the Government to identify new infrastructure projects and to expedite the approval for launching new property development projects.

The Board is satisfied that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing significant risks faced by the Group and that the existing internal control and risk management systems are adequate and effective to enable the Group to achieve its business objectives. The details of the Group's systems of risk management and internal control are reported in the Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control in this Annual Report.

The Internal Audit Function is outsourced to IA Essential Sdn Bhd, an internal audit consulting firm. The Internal Auditors have conducted their work with reference to the broad principles of the International Professional Practice Framework of the Institute of Internal Auditors. Besides reviewing the internal control systems, the Internal Auditor also assesses the governance, risk management and anti-corruption practices of the Group. The details of the internal audit function are disclosed in the ARMC Report in this Annual Report.

# STATEMENT ON

# RISK MANAGEMENT

# AND INTERNAL CONTROL

The Board of Directors ("Board") of Ekovest Berhad is pleased to present its Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control for the financial year ended 30 June 2023. The disclosure in this Statement is presented pursuant to Paragraph 15.26(b) of the Main Market Listing Requirements ("MMLR") of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad ("Bursa Securities") and is guided by the Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control: Guidelines for Directors of Listed Issuers.

# BOARD'S RESPONSIBILITIES

The Board acknowledges its overall risk management responsibilities, understands the principal risks of the six business segments, i.e. construction, property development, toll operation, plantation, food and beverages and property investment that the Group involves, and accepts that all business ventures require balancing risk, the cost for control, and return to shareholders.

The Board established the Audit and Risk Management Committee ("ARMC") to assist it in overseeing the systems of risk management and internal control in the Group. The procedures adopted by the ARMC in its oversight process include:

i. Reviewing the integrity of the interim financial results, annual report and audited financial statements in consultation with Management;  
ii. Evaluating the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal control systems based on the audit findings and timeliness of action taken by Management, reported by the Internal Auditors;  
iii. Seeking management clarification on business and operational issues as well as the measures taken by Management to mitigate and manage the business and operational challenges;  
iv. Studying the External Audit Memorandum on the annual audit findings and risk and control issues noted by them during their statutory audit; and  
v. Obtaining Management's assurance that the Group's risk management and internal control systems are adequate and effective in all material aspects.

# RISK MANAGEMENT

The Group's risk management continues to be driven by the Executive Directors and assisted by the Heads of Departments. The Executive Directors and Heads of Departments are responsible for identifying, evaluating, monitoring and managing significant risks appropriately and timely and assuring the Board that the Group's risk management and internal control systems are adequate and effective.

The Group recorded a further improvement in revenue after the upliftment of pandemic restrictions in 2021. To take advantage of this recovery further, in addition to strengthening the order books for the construction and sales in other business segments, the Group works closely with the Government to identify new infrastructure projects and to expedite the approval for launching new property development projects.

The Group was at net current liabilities position as of the financial year end. To mitigate its liquidity risk, subsequent to the financial year end, the Group has strengthened its cash flow through private placement, disposal of investment, unlocking the existing and securing new credit facilities.

The Board recognises the cyclical nature and risk exposure of the main principal activities of the Group, and surprise events like the pandemic can impact the Group's business resilience. Therefore, the long-term group risk management strategy is expanding and diversifying into other businesses to reduce dependency and reliance on its existing core business segments.

# ANNUAL REPORT 2023 STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL

# INTERNAL CONTROLS

In addition to the risk management processes, the Group continues to maintain the following internal control systems and "check and balance" mechanisms:

- Organisational structure outlining the lines of responsibilities and hierarchical structure covering the procurement, tenders, project management, legal administration, human resources, information system, and finance;  
- The Financial Assessment Committee ("FAC") and Technical Assessment Committee ("TAC") with a defined limit of approval for the evaluation and selection of tenders. Both FAC and TAC comprise Executive Board Members, Project Director, Head of Contract Department or Quantity Surveyor, Project Manager, and a representative from the Finance Department;  
- Contract budgeting and the review and monitoring of these budgets, project performance and variances reports for the contract jobs by the Executive Directors;  
Insurance coverage to minimise potential financial risk exposure resulting from construction activities, fire, perils, consequential loss, burglary and public liability;  
- Regular management meetings to discuss operational issues and monitor and review the effectiveness of actions taken to ensure that the business performance objectives are met;  
- The ISO 9001:2015 on Quality Management System, ISO 14001: 2015 on Environmental Management System and ISO 45001:2018 on Occupational Health and Safety Management System; and  
- The establishment and implementation of the anti-corruption framework, the corporate code of conduct and ethics, and the whistleblowing policy.

During the financial year, a refresher briefing was provided to 156 employees across the Group, addressing the application of the Group's anti-bribery and corruption policy, prevention of conflict of interest transactions and whistleblowing reporting.

# MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES AND ASSURANCE

In accordance with the Bursa Securities' Guidelines, Management is responsible for identifying risks; implementing and maintaining sound systems of risk management and internal control; and monitoring and reporting to the Board significant control deficiencies and changes in risks that could significantly affect the Group achievement of its objectives and performance.

In producing this Statement, the Board has received assurance from the Managing Director and Chief Finance Officer that the Group's risk management and internal control systems are operating adequately and effectively in all material aspects to the best of their knowledge.

# BOARD ASSURANCE AND LIMITATION

This Statement is prepared under paragraph 15.26(b) of the Main Market Listing Requirements and guided by the "Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control - Guidelines for Directors of Listed Issuers" ("the Guidelines"), which was endorsed by the Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad ("Bursa Securities").

# STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND

# INTERNAL CONTROL

# BOARD ASSURANCE AND LIMITATION (CONT'D)

The Board wishes to reiterate that risk management and internal control systems would be continuously improved in line with the evolving business environment.

Therefore, these systems can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatements, fraud and losses.

# REVIEW OF STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL BY EXTERNAL AUDITORS

As required by Paragraph 15.23 of the MMLR, the External Auditors have reviewed this Statement in accordance with the Audit and Assurance Practice Guide 3 (“AAPG3”) issued by the Malaysia Institute of Accountants.

The External Auditors reported to the Board that nothing has come to their attention that causes them to believe that this Statement is inconsistent with their understanding of the process adopted by the Board and Management in reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of the systems of risk management and internal control of the Group.

This Statement is made in accordance with the approval of the Board.

All Independent Directors conducted a self-assessment and declared that they have met the independence criteria set out in Chapter 1 of the Main Market Listing Requirements ("MMLR") and can exercise independent judgement and act in the best interest of the Company objectively.

(b) to ensure that any current assets which were unlikely to be realised in the ordinary course of business including the value of current assets as shown in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company had been written down to an amount which they might be expected so to realise.

(c) which have arisen which render adherence to the existing method of valuation of assets or liabilities of the Group and of the Company misleading or inappropriate; or  
(d) not otherwise dealt with in this report or financial statements of the Group and of the Company which would render any amount stated in the financial statements misleading.

At the date of this report, there does not exist:

(a) any charge on the assets of the Group and of the Company which has arisen since the end of the financial year which secures the liabilities of any other person; or  
(b) any contingent liability of the Group and of the Company which has arisen since the end of the financial year.

# DIRECTORS' REPORT

FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2023

# OTHER INFORMATION (CONT'D)

# INDEPENDENT

# AUDITORS' REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF EKOVEST BERHAD (INCORPORATED IN MALAYSIA) Registration No. 198501000052

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Ekovest Berhad, which comprise the statements of financial position as at 30 June 2023 of the Group and of the Company, and the statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows of the Group and of the Company for the financial year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies, as set out on pages 69 to 188.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and of the Company as at 30 June 2023, and of their financial performance and their cash flows for the financial year then ended in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.

# Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

# Independence and Other Ethical Responsibilities

We are independent of the Group and of the Company in accordance with the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, Conduct and Practice) of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants ("By-Laws") and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) ("IESBA Code"), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the By-Laws and the IESBA Code.

# Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

# (a) Amortisation and Impairment Assessment of Expressway Concession Assets

As at 30 June 2023, the Group's expressway concession assets amounted to RM7.7 billion, which represents approximately  $67\%$  of the Group's total assets. As disclosed in note 3.6 to the financial statements, the Group used projected traffic volume estimated by independent traffic consultant as a denominator to amortise the carrying amount of expressway concession assets over the concession period. The basis to arrive at the traffic volume projection take into consideration of the growth rate, and market and economic conditions. Management exercises judgement when adopting the projected traffic volume in determining the amortisation of expressway concession assets.

Further, impairment assessment of expressway concession assets requires significant judgements and estimates on discount rate applied for the calculation of recoverable value and the assumptions used in the cash flow projections, including the projected traffic volume and forecast growth rates over the projection period.

There is a risk that the estimated traffic volume, growth rate, discount rate and cash flow projections may be significantly different from actual outcome, resulting in material variance in the calculated amortisation and recoverable amount of the expressway concession assets.

TO THE MEMBERS OF EKOVEST BERHAD

(INCORPORATED IN MALAYSIA) Registration No. 198501000052

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT"D)

# Key Audit Matters (Cont'd)

# (a) Amortisation and Impairment Assessment of Expressway Concession Assets (Cont'd)

In view of the significance of the expressway concession assets, the level of judgement exercised by management and the estimation uncertainty, we identified amortisation and impairment assessment of expressway concession assets as key audit matters.

The Group's accounting policies and disclosures on expressway concession assets are disclosed in notes 3.6 and 9, respectively, to the financial statements.

# Our response:

Our audit procedures included, among others, the following:

(i) We considered and assessed the independent traffic consultant's competency, capability and objectivity;  
(ii) We obtained an understanding of the methodology adopted by the independent traffic consultant in estimating the traffic volume;  
(iii) We assessed the reasonableness of the assumptions applied in determining the projected traffic volume;  
(iv) We assessed and challenged the reasonableness of key assumptions, including traffic volume projection, discount rate and growth rates used in cash flow projections for impairment assessment;  
(v) We tested the mathematically accuracy of amortisation amount and recoverable amount calculation; and  
(vi) We performed sensitivity analysis on the projected traffic volume and key assumptions used and assessed the impact to the carrying amount of expressway concession assets.

# (b) Valuation of Investment Properties

The Group's investment properties as at 30 June 2023 amounted to RM858 million.

The Group adopts fair value model for its investment properties. The fair value of the Group's investment properties was determined by management based on valuations performed by independent valuers. The fair value of the investment properties was determined by using investment and comparison methods.

The valuation process involves significant judgement in determining the appropriate valuation methodologies and the underlying assumptions. The valuations are highly sensitive to key assumptions applied and any change in the assumptions can have a significant impact to the valuations.

In view of the significance of the investment properties, the level of judgement exercised by management and the estimation uncertainty, we identified valuation of investment properties as a key audit matter.

The Group's accounting policies and disclosures on investment properties are disclosed in notes 3.8 and 6 respectively, to the financial statements.

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT"D)

# Key Audit Matters (Cont'd)

# (b) Valuation of Investment Properties (Cont'd)

# Our response:

Our audit procedures included, among others, the following:

(i) We considered and assessed the independent valuers' competency, capability and objectivity;  
(ii) We discussed and obtained an understanding of the methodologies and key assumptions adopted by the independent valuers in estimating the fair value of the investment properties;  
(iii) We assessed the reasonableness of key assumptions and inputs in the valuations under comparison method, including, where applicable, selling prices of recent transactions and historical transaction prices of similar properties of nearby location, any adjustments for tenure, location, development concept and size;  
(iv) We tested the reasonableness of rental income and rental periods applied in the valuation under investment method, by comparing them with signed tenancy agreements on sample basis; and  
(v) We tested and challenged the significant inputs applied in the valuations under investment method, such as market rental reversion, net projected operating costs, void allowance rate, projection of other income, yield rate, terminal yield rate by comparing them against historical data and available industry data for similar property types.

# (c) Revenue Recognition for Construction Contracts

For the financial year ended 30 June 2023, revenue generated from construction contracts amounted to RM546 million representing approximately  $49\%$  of the Group's total revenue. The Company's revenue from construction contracts amounted RM120 million for the same period, representing approximately  $99\%$  of the Company's total revenue.

Revenue from construction contracts is recognised over time, which requires management to exercise significant judgement in measuring the progress towards satisfaction of the performance obligations as stated in the contracts with customers.

The estimation of the percentage of completion requires significant judgement in estimating the total construction costs for each of the contracts. Other areas of estimation, including the obligations to contract variations, claim, cost contingencies and rebates.

There is a risk that the estimated revenue, cost or margins may be significantly different from the actual outcome, resulting in material variance in amount of revenue and/or profit recognised in the financial statements.

In the view of the significance of revenue from construction contracts recognised by the Group and by the Company, the level of judgement exercised by management and the estimation uncertainty, we identified revenue recognition for construction contracts as a key audit matter.

The Group's accounting policies on revenue recognition and disclosure on revenue from construction contracts are disclosed in notes 3.22 and 40 respectively, to the financial statements.

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT"D)

# Key Audit Matters (Cont'd)

# (c) Revenue Recognition for Construction Contracts (Cont'd)

# Our response:

Our audit procedures included, among others, the following:

(i) We obtained understanding of the revenue recognition process and tested the operating effectiveness of the Group's internal controls relating to recognition of revenue and cost;  
(ii) We assessed the reasonableness of management's key assumptions used in the estimates for total construction costs for each of those projects, where applicable, examining documentary evidences such as signed letters of awards, approved variation orders, and performing retrospective review of the key estimates;  
(iii) We validated the contract revenue against the agreed customers' contracts;  
(iv) We recomputed management's computed percentage of completion after considering implications of identified errors (if any) or changes in estimates;  
(v) We tested on sampling basis, actual cost incurred to relevant supporting documents such as contractors' claim certificates and suppliers' invoices. Where costs have not been billed or certified, we assessed the adequacy of accruals of such costs by reviewing subsequent contractors' claim certificates and suppliers' invoices; and  
(vi) We evaluated whether the Group or the Company is liable for liquidated ascertained damages by reviewing the contractual delivery dates of the signed agreements against the estimated delivery dates and latest progress reports.

# (d) Basis of Accounting Assessment

The financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the financial year ended 30 June 2023 have been prepared on a going concern basis. As at 30 June 2023, the Group and the Company reported net current liabilities position as disclosed in notes 3.1 and 55(c) to the financial statements.

This is considered a key audit matter because the evaluation of the basis of accounting involved management's judgement and estimation uncertainty. The management's judgement relates to their assessment of the appropriateness of the basis of accounting with reference to the underlying assumptions and plans and the actions taken by the Group and by the Company.

# Our response:

Our audit procedures included, among others, the following:

(i) We obtained an understanding of the management's actions taken after the end of the financial year, and cash flows forecast and plans for the next twelve months;  
(ii) We assessed and challenged the management's key assumptions that form the basis of their forecast and plans to evaluate whether they are reasonably made in the circumstances; and we had considered the track records of the relevant businesses, market conditions, and compliance with covenants of borrowings; and  
(iii) We evaluated the reasonableness of the management's assessment that the Group and the Company are able to meet their financial obligations as and when they fall due at least in the next twelve months from the date of this report and the appropriateness of their basis of accounting applied in the financial statements.

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT"D)

# Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditors' Report Thereon

The directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but does not include the financial statements of the Group and of the Company and our auditors' report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Statements

The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that give a true and fair view in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The directors are also responsible for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

# Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.  
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's and the Company's internal control.

# AUDITORS' REPORT

TO THE MEMBERS OF EKOVEST BERHAD

(INCORPORATED IN MALAYSIA) Registration No. 198501000052

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT"D)

# Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements (Cont'd)

As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: (Cont'd)

- Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's or the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.  
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.  
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements of the Group. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

In accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia, we report that the subsidiaries of which we have not acted as auditors, are disclosed in note 13 to the financial statements.

# OTHER MATTER

This report is made solely to the members of the Company, as a body, in accordance with Section 266 of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility to any other person for the content of this report.

# 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

# 3.1 Basis of accounting

The financial statements of the Group and the Company have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for other measurement bases applied, including fair value, as stated in the accounting policies below.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using a valuation technique.

For purpose of financial reporting, all assets and liabilities, for which fair value is measured or disclosed, are categorised within the fair value hierarchy set out below based on the inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement:

Level 1 : Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets (for identical assets or liabilities).  
Level 2 : Inputs (other than quoted prices included within Level 1) are observable either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).  
Level 3 : Valuation techniques that include unobservable inputs (not based on observable market data).

The financial statements of the Group and of the Company have been prepared on a going concern basis. This basis presumes that the business operations of the Group and of the Company will be sustainable in the foreseeable future and consequently, the realisation of assets and the settlement of liability will occur in the ordinary course of business. Further details are set out in note 55(c) to the financial statements.

# 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)

# 3.2 Basis of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and of the entities controlled by the Company made up to the end of the financial year.

The Company controls an investee if and only if the Company has all the following:

(i) power over the investee;  
(ii) exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and  
(iii) the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor's returns.

When the Company has no majority voting rights of an investee, it considers that it has power over the investee if the voting rights are sufficient to give it the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee unilaterally.

The consolidated financial statements are prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances. All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation. Consolidation of an investee shall begin from the date the Company obtains control of the investee and cease when the investor loses control of the investee.

Non-controlling interests are initially measured at fair value. Subsequently, non-controlling interests are the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests' share of subsequent changes in equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.

# Changes of interests in subsidiaries

The changes of interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are treated as equity transactions between the Group and non-controlling interest holders. Any gain or loss arising from equity transactions is recognised directly in equity.

When the Company loses control of a subsidiary:

(i) it derecognises the assets and liabilities, non-controlling interests, and other amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income relating to the former subsidiary.  
(ii) it recognises any gain or loss in profit or loss attributable to the Group, which is calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received, if any, from the transaction, event or circumstances that resulted in the loss of control; plus any investment retained in the former subsidiary at its fair value at the date when control is lost; and (ii) the net carrying amount of assets, liabilities, goodwill and any non-controlling interests attributable to the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost.  
(iii) it recognises any investment retained in the former subsidiary at its fair value when control is lost. That fair value shall be regarded as the fair value on initial recognition of a financial asset in accordance with MFRS 9 or, when appropriate, the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or joint venture.

# NOTES TO THE

# FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2023

# 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)

# 3.3 Business combination

The Group accounts for each business combination by applying the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business combination shall be measured at fair value, which shall be calculated as the sum of the acquisition date fair values of the assets transferred by the acquirer, the liabilities incurred by the acquirer to former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the acquirer. Acquisition related costs are recognised as expenses when the costs are incurred.

On the date of acquisition, goodwill is measured as the excess of (i) over (ii) below:

(i) The aggregate of: (i) the fair value of consideration transferred; (ii) the amount of any non-controlling interests in the investee; and (iii) the fair value of the Group's previously held equity interest in the investee, if the business combination achieved in stages.  
(ii) The net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.

If, after reassessment, a business combination in which the amount in (ii) above exceeds the aggregate of the amounts in (i) above, the Group recognises the resulting gain in profit or loss.

Measurement period adjustments are adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during 12 months from the acquisition date, about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the reporting date in which the business combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the business combination. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period, or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of the acquisition date.

When the consideration in a business combination includes contingent consideration, the contingent consideration is measured at fair value on acquisition date.

- Subsequent changes in fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as measurement period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments against goodwill.  
- Subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments: (i) contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured at subsequent reporting dates and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity; or (ii) other contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss.

# 3.4 Investments in associates and joint ventures

An associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint arrangement. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint control over those policies.

A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Joint control is the sharing of control of an arrangement contractually, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties.

Investments in associates or joint ventures are accounted for in the financial statements using the equity method. The results and net assets of associates or joint ventures are accounted using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances. An investment is accounted for using the equity method from the date on which the Group obtains significant influence or joint control until the date the Group ceases to have a significant influence or joint control. Under the equity method, the investments are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter for post-acquisition changes in the Group's share of net assets of the associates or joint ventures. Unrealised gains or losses on transactions between the Group and its associates or joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the associates or joint ventures.

# 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)

# 3.4 Investments in associates and joint ventures (Cont'd)

On acquisition of an investment in an associate or joint venture, any excess of the cost of the investment over the Group's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the investee is recognised as goodwill, which is included within the carrying amount of the investment, and goodwill is not tested for impairment separately. Any excess of the Group's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities over the cost of the investment, after reassessment, is recognised in profit or loss.

When the Group's share of losses of an associate or joint venture exceeds the Group's interest in that associate or joint venture (includes long term interests that form part of the Group's net investment in the associate or joint venture, in substance), equity accounting is discontinued; unless the Group has legal or constructive obligations for such losses.

At each reporting date, the Group determines whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in an associate or a joint venture is impaired. If there is such indication, management recognises impairment loss in profit or loss as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate or joint venture and its carrying value.

When changes in the Group's interest in an associate or joint venture do not affect the use of equity method, the Group reclassifies to profit or loss the proportion of the gain or loss that had previously been recognised in other comprehensive income relating to that reduction in ownership interest if that gain or loss would be reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal of the related assets or liabilities.

The Group discontinues the use of equity accounting from the date when the investment ceases to be an associate or a joint venture. When the Group retains an interest in the former associate or former joint venture and the retained interest is a financial asset, the Group measures the retained interest at fair value and the fair value is regarded as its fair value on initial recognition. Any gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. In addition, if a gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income by the associate or joint venture would be reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal of the related assets or liabilities, the Group reclassifies the gain or loss from equity to profit or loss (as a reclassification adjustment) when the associate or joint venture is disposed.

# 3.5 Investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures (separate financial statements)

In the Company's separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are measured at cost less impairment losses, if any. Impairment losses are charged to profit or loss.

On disposal, the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the investments is recognised in profit or loss.

# 3.6 Concession assets

Concession assets are recognised to the extent that the Group has a right (a licence) to charge users of the public services.

Concession assets refer to expressway development expenditures ("EDE") and park and ride building which comprise development and upgrading expenditures (including interest charges relating to financing of the development) incurred in connection with the concession.

Concession assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses. Amortisation of the concession assets begins when it is available for use, which means when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.

# NOTES TO THE

# FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2023

# 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)

# 3.6 Concession assets (Cont'd)

EDE is amortised over the concession period. The amortisation formula applied in the preparation of the financial statements to arrive at the annual amortisation charge for each financial year is as follows:

Traffic volume for the year

(Actual traffic volume for the year + Projected total traffic volume for the subsequent years to the end of the concession period)

X (Net book value of EDE at the beginning of the year + Additions for the year)

The projected total traffic volume is based on the latest available base case traffic projection prepared by independent traffic consultants.

The traffic volume projection is independently reviewed on a periodic basis.

Park and ride building is amortised based on straight-line over remaining concession period of 50 years.

When an indication of impairment exists, the concession assets are subject to impairment test.

# 3.7 Property, plant and equipment

# (i) Measurement basis

Property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are recognised as profit or loss when incurred.

Subsequent to initial recognition, property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.

Property, plant and equipment are derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. On disposal, the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the net carrying amount is recognised in the profit or loss.

# (ii) Depreciation

Freehold land and capital work-in-progress are not depreciated.

Depreciation is calculated to write off the depreciable amount of other property, plant and equipment on the straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Depreciable amount is determined after deducting the residual value from the cost.

The principal annual rates used for this purpose are:

Buildings

Equipment, plant and machinery

Motor vehicles

Office equipment

Furniture and fittings

Renovation

2% - 3%

4% - 20%

10% - 33 1/3%

# (ii) Depreciation (Cont'd)

The residual values, useful lives and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period to ensure that the amount, method and period of depreciation are consistent with previous estimates and the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the items of property, plant and equipment.

# 3.8 Investment properties

Investment properties are properties held to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or both rather than for use in the production or supply of goods and services or for administrative purposes, or sale in the ordinary course of business.

Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. The carrying amount includes the cost of replacing part of an existing investment property at the time that cost is incurred if the recognition criteria is met; and excludes the costs of day-to-day servicing of an investment property.

Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are stated at fair value, which reflects market conditions at the end of reporting period. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair values of investment properties are recognised in the profit or loss in the year in which they arise.

Investment properties are derecognised upon disposal or when they are permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected from their disposal. On disposal, the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount is recognised in the profit or loss.

When an item of property, plant and equipment is transferred to investment property following a change in its use, any difference arising at the date of transfer between the carrying amount of the item immediately prior to transfer and its fair value is recognised directly in equity as a revaluation of property, plant and equipment. However, if a fair value gain reverses a previous impairment loss, the gain is recognised in profit or loss. Upon disposal of an investment property, any surplus previously recorded in equity is transferred to retained earnings; the transfer is not made through profit or loss.

When the use of a property changes such that it is reclassified as property, plant and equipment or inventories; its fair value at the date of reclassification becomes its cost for subsequent accounting.

# 3.9 Biological assets

Biological assets comprised of produce growing on bearer plants and other biological assets. Biological assets are measured at fair value less costs to sell. Any gain or losses arising from changes in the fair value less costs to sell are recognised in profit or loss.

Biological assets are classified as current assets for produce that are expected to be harvested and sold on a date not more than 12 months after the reporting date and the balance is classified as non-current.

# 3.10 Bearer plants

# Recognition and measurement

Bearer plants are living plants that are used in the supply of agriculture produce for more than one period and have remote likelihood of being sold as agriculture produce.

Bearer plants comprise pre-cropping costs incurred on land preparation, construction of drains, roads and irrigation, fertilisation, plant and planting, labour and any general overheads directly attributed to the development of the rootstock. Pre-cropping costs incurred are capitalised at cost and amortised over the useful life of the rootstock commencing from the date of maturity of the rootstock.

# 3.10 Bearer plants (Cont'd)

# Recognition and measurement (Cont'd)

The carrying values of bearer plants are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at each financial year end to ensure that the amount method and period of amortisation are consistent with previous estimates and the expected pattern of consumption of the future benefits.

The policy for the recognition and measurement of impairment loss is in accordance with note 3.19.

A bearer plants is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from it, use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the bearer plants is included in the profit or loss in the year the bearer plants is derecognised.

Interest costs on borrowings and depreciation of bearer plants that are directly attributed to new planting or replanting incurred prior to maturity are also included in the pre-cropping costs.

# Amortisation

Amortisation is recognised in the profit or loss on straight line basis commencing from the date of maturity over the mature period of the of each component of bearer plants at the following basis:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Life cycle</td><td>Immature period</td><td>Mature period</td></tr><tr><td>Oil palm</td><td>30 years</td><td>4 years</td><td>26 years</td></tr><tr><td>Durian trees</td><td>80 years</td><td>7 years</td><td>73 years or over the remaining mature period</td></tr><tr><td>Rubber trees</td><td>15 years</td><td>7 years</td><td>8 years</td></tr><tr><td>Pineapple trees</td><td>2 years</td><td>10 months</td><td>13 months</td></tr></table>

The useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date.

# 3.11 Forest plantation project

The forest plantation project is measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment loss.

The Group amortises its land use rights using straight-line method less impairment loss, if any, over the remaining management period of 30 to 60 years in accordance with the privatisation agreement.

The policy for the recognition and measurement of impairment loss is in accordance with note 3.19. The amortisation expense is recognised in profit or loss.

# 3.12 Leases

# The Group as Lessee

Right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities are recognised with respect to all lease agreements, except for short-term leases and leases of low value assets.

For short-term leases (i.e. leases with a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low value assets, lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the lease commencement date, discounted using the rate implicit in the lease or incremental borrowing rate, where applicable. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise: (i) fixed lease payments, less lease incentives; (ii) variable lease payments based upon an index or a rate; and (iii) payments of penalties for terminating the lease.

The right-of-use assets comprise the corresponding lease liability, lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date and initial direct costs. Whenever there is an obligation to dismantle and remove a leased asset, restore the site on which it is located or restore the underlying asset to the agreed condition, a provision is recognised. These costs are included in the related right-of-use assets.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. They are depreciated over the shorter period of lease term and useful life of the underlying assets. The estimated useful lives of the right-of-use assets are determined as follows:

Forest plantation project

Leasehold land

Motor vehicles

Office equipment

Plant and machinery

Buildings

Contract farming

Contract logging rights

30 to 60 years

6 to 92 years

5 to 7 years

5 years

5 to 10 years

1 to 10 years

3 to 6 years

Over lease term

The depreciation periods and depreciation method are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date.

Variable lease payment (not based upon an index or a rate) are recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.

# 3.12 Leases (Cont'd)

# The Group as Lessor

Leases are classified as finance leases or operating leases. Whenever the lease transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Initial direct costs incurred are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recognised as receivables at the amount of the net investment in the leases. Finance lease income is allocated to reporting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment outstanding in respect of the leases.

# 3.13 Intangible assets

# (i) Franchise rights

Franchise fees represent amount paid or payable in respect of the new outlets opened. The franchise fees are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over the granted franchise rights periods of 4 years. The franchise fees are amortised from the effective date of franchise agreement.

The cost of trademark acquired represents its fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, trademark is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Trademark, which is considered to have indefinite useful life, is not amortised but tested for impairment, annually or more frequently when indicators of impairment are identified. The useful life of trademark is reviewed annually to determine whether indefinite life assessment continues to be supportable. If not, the change in the useful life assessment from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.

Trademark which has finite useful lives, is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Trademark with finite useful lives is amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic useful lives. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for the trademark are reviewed at each reporting date.

# (iii) Goodwill

Goodwill acquired in a business combination represents the difference between the purchase consideration and the Group's interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities in the subsidiaries at the date of acquisition.

Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units and is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. Impairment test is performed annually. Goodwill is also tested for impairment when indication of impairment exists. Impairment losses recognised are not reversed in subsequent periods.

Upon the disposal of investment in the subsidiary, the related goodwill will be included in the computation of gain or loss on disposal of investment in the subsidiary in the profit or loss.

# 3.14 Property development

Property development is classified under two categories i.e. land held for property development and property development costs.

# Land held for property development

Land held for property development is land on which development is not expected to be completed within the normal operating cycle. No significant development work would have been undertaken on the land. Accordingly, land held for property development is classified as a non-current asset. Land held for property development is measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs include incidental expenditure incurred to put the land in a condition ready for development.

Land on which development has commenced and is expected to be completed within the normal operating cycle is included in property development costs (current asset).

# Property development costs

Property development costs comprise all costs that are directly attributable to development activities or that can be allocated on a reasonable basis to such activities. Property development costs are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and applicable selling expenses.

Property development costs are subsequently recognised as an expense in profit or loss when or as the entity's performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time.

# 3.15 Performance deposits

Performance deposits are initially recognised as the advance net profit entitlement in respect of the Privatisation Agreement as stated in note 17. The performance deposits shall be set-off against future profit entitlement over the management period of 60 years.

Any outstanding balance of the performance deposits at the end of the 60 years management period that is not set off due to insufficient distributable profit shall be recognised to profit or loss.

# 3.16 Contract assets and contract liabilities

Contract assets are the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to customers. If goods or services are transferred to customers before the customers pay consideration or before payment is due, contract assets are recognised for the earned consideration that is conditional. Trade receivables represent the entity's right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional.

Contract liabilities are the obligation to transfer goods or services to customers for which the entity has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customers. If the customers pay consideration before the entity transfers goods or services to the customers, contract liabilities are recognised when the payment is made, or the payment is due (whichever is earlier).

# 3.17 Contract costs

# Property development contracts costs

Represents development costs attributable to development unit that are sold at reporting date. The capitalised costs are amortised on a systematic basis that is consistent with the entity's transfer of the related goods or services to the customer. Property development contracts costs are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and applicable selling expenses.

# 3.17 Contract costs (Cont'd)

# Pre-contract cost

The Group recognises pre-contract cost that relate directly to a contract or to an anticipated contract as an asset. An impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss when the carrying amount of the contract cost asset exceeds the expected revenue less expected costs that will be incurred.

# 3.18 Provision for heavy repairs

Heavy repairs relate to repair of bridges, slopes and embankments, rectification of settlements and pavement rehabilitation of medium and high traffic sections along the expressway.

Provision for heavy repairs, being the contractual obligations to maintain and restore the infrastructure to a specified standard of serviceability, is recognised and measured at the present value of estimated expenditures expected to be required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date.

# 3.19 Impairment of non-financial assets

# Goodwill and trademark

Goodwill and trademark are tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill and trademark may be impaired.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from synergies of the business combination.

An impairment loss is recognised when the carrying amount of a cash-generating unit, including the goodwill, exceeds the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit. Recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is the higher of the cash-generating unit's fair value less cost to sell and its value in use. The total impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of the allocated goodwill and trademark and then to the other assets in that cash-generating unit proportionately on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in that cash-generating unit. Impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.

# Property, plant and equipment, concession assets, bearer plants, forest plantation project, franchise rights, right-of-use assets and investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint venture

Property, plant and equipment, concession assets, bearer plants, forest plantation project, franchise rights, right-of-use assets and investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint venture are assessed at the end of each reporting period to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.

If such an indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less cost to sell and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the assets. Recoverable amounts are estimated for individual assets or, if it is not possible, for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.

Any reversal of an impairment loss as a result of a subsequent increase in recoverable amount should not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortisation or depreciation, if applicable) had no impairment loss been previously recognised for the asset.

# 3.20 Inventories

Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on the weighted average basis.

Cost comprises direct materials, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less selling and distribution costs and all other estimated cost to completion.

# 3.21 Financial instruments

Financial assets (with the exception of trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component) and financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities on initial recognition. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at its transaction price.

Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities on initial recognition.

# Financial assets

All regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date basis. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.

# Subsequent measurement

All recognised financial assets are subsequently measured in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value, depending on the classification of the financial assets. Financial assets are measured subsequently in the following manners:

- at amortised cost (debt instruments);  
- at fair value through other comprehensive income ("FVTOCI"), with recycling of cumulative gains and losses (debt instruments);  
- designated at FVTOCI, without recycling of cumulative gains and losses (equity instruments); or  
- at fair value through profit or loss ("FVTPL").

# Financial assets at amortised cost

Debt instruments that meet the following conditions are subsequently measured at amortised cost:

- the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and  
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest method and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when an asset is derecognised, modified or impaired.

# Financial assets at FVTPL

Financial assets that do not meet the criteria for being measured at amortised cost or FVTOCI are measured at FVTPL, including but not limited to:

- Debt instruments that are designated as at FVTPL, if such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognising the gains and losses on them on different bases.  
Derivative instruments.

Financial assets at FVTPL are measured at fair value, with fair value gains or losses recognised in profit or loss to the extent they are not part of a designated hedging relationship. The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss includes any dividend or interest earned on the financial assets.

# Impairment of financial assets

Loss allowance is recognised for expected credit losses ("ECL") for all debt instruments not held at FVTPL, i.e. financial assets at amortised cost or FVTOCI, receivables, lease receivables, contract assets, loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts.

ECL is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that are expected to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms. The amount of ECL is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the respective financial asset.

Management measures the loss allowance of trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables at an amount equal to their lifetime ECL (i.e. simplified approach). The ECL on these financial assets are estimated based on historical credit loss experience, and where appropriate, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment.

For all other financial assets at amortised cost, where credit exposures for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, ECL is provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date. For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in the likelihood or risk of a default occurring since initial recognition (instead of on evidence of a financial asset being credit-impaired at the reporting date or an actual default occurring), a loss allowance is required for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the financial assets.

The Group considers a financial asset to be in default when contractual payments are more than 90 days past due, unless there is reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a more lagging default criterion is more appropriate. The Group also considers a financial asset is in default when there is a breach of financial covenants by the debtor; or when there is indication that the debtor is unlikely to settle its indebtedness to the Group in full, without considering any collaterals held by the Group.

# Derecognition of financial assets

A financial asset is derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire; or when the financial asset is transferred and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred to another party.

If the entity neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control a transferred financial asset, the entity recognises its retained interest in the financial asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the entity retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the entity continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.

# 3.21 Financial instruments (Cont'd)

# Derecognition of financial assets (Cont'd)

On derecognition of a financial asset measured at amortised cost, the difference between the financial asset's carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable is recognised in profit or loss. On derecognition of an investment in a debt instrument classified as at FVTOCI, the cumulative gain or loss previously accumulated in the reserve is reclassified to profit or loss. On derecognition of an investment in equity instrument classified at FVTOCI, the cumulative gain or loss previously accumulated in the reserve is transferred to retained earnings.

# Financial liabilities and equity instruments

Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.

# Financial liabilities

All financial liabilities are subsequently measured at FVTPL or at amortised cost.

# Financial liabilities at amortised cost

These financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

# Effective interest method

The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a debt instrument or a financial liability by allocating interest income/expense over the relevant periods. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts/payments (including all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of a debt instrument or a financial liability, to the amortised cost of the debt instrument or the financial liability.

# Financial guarantee contracts

A financial guarantee contract is a contract that requires the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument.

Financial guarantee contracts issued are initially measured at their fair values and, if not designated as at FVTPL and do not arise from a transfer of a financial asset, are subsequently measured at the higher of:

- the loss allowance determined in accordance with MFRS 9; and  
- the amount recognised initially less, where appropriate, cumulative amount of income recognised.

# Derecognition of financial liabilities

Financial liabilities are derecognised when, and only when, the obligations under the liabilities are discharged, cancelled or expired. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised and the consideration paid and payable, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in profit or loss.

When an existing financial liability is replaced by another financial liability from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability.

# Equity instrument

Equity instruments issued are recognised at the proceeds received. Costs incurred directly attributable to the issuance of the equity instruments are accounted for as a deduction from equity.

Repurchase of own equity instruments is deducted directly in equity. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of own equity instruments.

# 3.22 Revenue and other income recognition

Revenue from a contract with a customer is recognised when control of the goods or services are transferred to the customer. Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the goods or services to the customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties.

If a contract with a customer contains more than one performance obligation, the total consideration is allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative stand-alone selling prices of the goods or services promised in the contract.

# Construction contracts and property development

Revenue is recognised over time, if (i) the entity creates an asset with no alternative use to the entity and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to-date; or (ii) a customer controls the asset as it is created or enhanced by the entity.

Revenue is recognised over the period of the contract by measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation. Revenue is measured on the basis of the entity's efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of a performance obligation relative to the total expected inputs to the satisfaction of that performance obligation. The stage of completion is determined by the proportion of contract costs incurred to-date relative to the estimated total contract costs.

Revenue from sales of completed properties is recognised when the control of the properties is transferred to the buyers.

# Project management fee

Revenue from project management services is recognised over time, if a customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity's performance as the entity performs.

Revenue from project management services is recognised using an input method to measure progress towards complete satisfaction of the services.

# Toll revenue

Toll revenue is accounted for as and when toll is chargeable for the usage of the expressway.

# Toll compensation

Pursuant to Concession Agreement, the Government of Malaysia ("Government") reserves the right to restructure or to restrict the imposition of unit toll rate increases, and in such event, the Government shall compensate the Group for any deduction in toll revenue, subject to negotiation and other considerations that the Government may deem fit. Toll compensation for any concession year is recognised in the financial statements as revenue when recovery is probable and the amount that is recoverable can be measured reliably.

Energy fee derived from the conversion into electricity of renewable energy resources is recognised as revenue upon actual delivery of such converted energy.

# Sales of goods

Revenue from sales of food and beverages and plantation products and produces is recognised at the point in time when control of the goods is transferred to a customer, generally upon delivery of goods.

In measuring the revenue for the sales of goods, the effects of variable consideration, the existence of significant financing component, non-cash consideration, and consideration payable to the customer, etc. are taken into consideration.

# Room revenue

Hotel revenue from room rental is recognised over time during the period of stay for the hotel guests.

# Food and beverage revenue

Revenue from sales of food and beverage is recognised at the point in time when the control of the goods is transferred to a customer, generally upon delivery of goods.

Other revenue is recognised as follows:

- Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.  
Other income is recognised as follows:  
- Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method.

# 3.23 Employee benefits

# (i) Short term employee benefits

Salaries, wages, bonuses, allowances, paid annual leave and paid sick leave are recognised as an expense in the period in which the services are rendered by employees.

# 3.24 Borrowing costs

Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset shall be capitalised as part of the cost of that asset.

A qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale. Unsold work-in-progress (inventories) which is ready for its intended sale in its current condition, contract assets and financial assets are not a qualifying asset.

Capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when the activities to prepare the asset for its intended use or sale are in progress and the expenditures and borrowing costs are incurred. Capitalisation of borrowing costs ceases when the asset is ready for its intended use or sale; or during extended periods when active development of the asset is suspended.

All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the financial period in which they are incurred.

# 3.25 Income tax

The income tax expense represents the aggregate of current tax and deferred tax.

Current tax and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss. Current tax and deferred tax are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, if the tax relates to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. Where deferred tax arises from a business combination, the tax effect is included in the accounting for the business combination.

# Current tax

Current tax is the expected income tax payable on the taxable profit for the year, estimated using the tax rates enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date.

A provision is recognised for those matters for which the tax determination is uncertain, but it is considered probable that there will be a future payment to a tax authority. The provisions are measured at the best estimate of the amount expected to become payable.

# Deferred tax

Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, which is accounted using the liability method.

A deferred tax liability is recognised for all taxable temporary differences. A deferred tax asset is only recognised for deductible temporary differences and unutilised tax credit to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available in future against which the deductible temporary differences and unutilised tax credit can be utilised.

No deferred tax is recognised for temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of: (i) goodwill, or (ii) an asset or liability (which is not in a business combination) at the time of the transaction that affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit.

Deferred taxes are measured based on tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the asset or liability is expected to be recovered or settled and based on the tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date that are expected to apply to the financial period when the asset is realised or when the liability is settled.

# 3.26 Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and bank balances, bank overdrafts and other short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.

For the purpose of the statements of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents are presented net of bank overdrafts and designated bank account pledged.

# 3.27 Segment reporting

Segment reporting in the financial statements is presented on the same basis as that used by management internally for evaluating operating segment performance and in deciding on the allocation of resources to each operating segment. Operating segments are distinguishable components of the Group that engage in business activities from which they may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group's other components. An operating segment's results are reviewed regularly by the chief operating decision maker to decide on the allocation of resources to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.

Segment revenue, expense, assets and liabilities are those amounts resulting from operating activities of a segment that are directly attributable to the segment and a relevant portion that can be allocated on a reasonable basis to the segment.

Segment revenue, expense, assets and liabilities are determined before intra-group balances and intra-group transactions are eliminated as part of the consolidation process, except to the extent that such intra-group balances and transactions are between group entities within a single segment.

# 3.28 Contingencies

# (i) Contingent liabilities

Where it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required, or the amount cannot be estimated reliably, the obligation is not recognised in the statements of financial position and is disclosed as a contingent liability, unless the probability of outflow of economic benefits is remote.

Possible obligations, whose existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more future events, are also disclosed as contingent liabilities unless the probability of outflow of economic benefits is remote.

# (ii) Contingent assets

Where it is not probable that there is economic benefits, or the amount cannot be estimated reliably, the asset is not recognised in the statements of financial position and is disclosed as contingent asset, unless the probability of inflow of economic benefits is remote.

Possible obligations, whose existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one of more future events, are also disclosed as contingent assets unless the probability of inflow of economic benefits is remote.

# 3.29 Government grant

Government grants shall not be recognised until there is reasonable assurance that: (a) the Group will comply with the conditions attaching to them; and (b) the grants will be received.

Government grants (recognised as deferred income) shall be recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the financial periods in which the Group recognises as expenses the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate.

# 3.30 Foreign currencies

# Transactions and balances in foreign currencies

Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency ("foreign currencies") are recognised at the prevailing exchange rate on the date of the transaction. At the reporting date, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the prevailing exchange rate on that date.

Non-monetary items which are measured in terms of historical costs denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the prevailing exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items which are measured at fair values denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the prevailing exchange rate on the date when the fair values were determined.

Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss, except for:

- Exchange differences on borrowings denominated in foreign currency relating to an asset under construction, which are included in the cost of that asset when the exchange difference is regarded as an adjustment to interest costs on those foreign currency borrowings.  
- Exchange differences on amounts receivable from or payable to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future (i.e. form part of the net investment in that foreign operation), which are recognised initially in other comprehensive income and reclassified from equity to profit or loss on disposal or partial disposal of the net investment.

# Translation of foreign operations

For consolidation purposes, all assets and liabilities of foreign operations (including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition of a foreign operation) are translated at the prevailing exchange rate on the reporting date. Income and expense are translated at average exchange rate for the financial period. Exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of the foreign operation are recognised in other comprehensive income; accumulated in a separate component of equity and attributed to non-controlling interests as appropriate.

On disposal of a foreign operation (i.e. loss of control, joint control or significant influence), the accumulated exchange differences recognised in equity relating to that foreign operation is reclassified to profit or loss.

In a partial disposal that does not result in losing of control over a foreign operation, the proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences in equity is re attributed to non-controlling interests and are not recognised in profit or loss. For other partial disposals (i.e. partial disposals of associates or joint ventures that do not result in losing of significant influence or joint control), the proportionate share of the accumulated exchange differences in equity is reclassified to profit or loss.

# 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)

# 3.31 Fair value

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

All assets and liabilities, for which fair value is measured or disclosed, are categorised within the fair value hierarchy set out below based on the inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement. Fair value measurement is derived from:

Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets (for identical assets or liabilities).  
Level 2: Inputs (other than quoted prices included within Level 1) are observable either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).  
Level 3: Valuation techniques that include unobservable inputs (not based on observable market data).

# 3.32 Earnings per share

Basic earnings per share ("EPS") is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Group by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.

Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.

# 4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in the process of applying the accounting policies. It also requires the use of accounting estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities (if any) at the end of the reporting period and reported amounts of income and expenses during the financial year.

Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions, historical experience and various other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the financial period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.

The key judgement and assumptions concerning the future and other key sources associated with estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are as follows:

# Revenue recognition of construction contracts

The Group and the Company recognise revenue from construction contracts based on the percentage of completion method. The percentage of completion of the construction contracts is measured in accordance with the accounting policies set out in note 3.22.

Significant judgement is required in determining the percentage of completion, the extent of the contract costs incurred, the estimated total revenue and total costs and the recoverability of the contract. In making these judgements, management relies on past experience and the work of specialists.

# Depreciation of property, plant and equipment and bearer plants

The Group and the Company review the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment and bearer plants at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful lives of property, plant and equipment and bearer plants could impact future depreciation charges.

# Impairment of property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and bearer plants

Property, plant and equipment, right-of-use-assets and bearer plants are assessed at the end of each reporting period to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If such an indication exists, an estimation of the recoverable amount is required. Estimating the recoverable amount (based on value in use) requires management to make an estimate of the future cash flows from the property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and bearer plants or the related cash generating unit and the discount rate.

# Fair value of investment properties

The Group and the Company measure their investment properties at fair value with any change in fair value recognised in the profit or loss. Significant judgement is required in the determination of fair value which may be derived based on different valuation methods. In making the judgement, the Group and the Company evaluate based on past experience and reliance on the work of specialists. The Group and the Company engage independent professional valuers to determine the fair value using comparison and investment methods.

The valuation methodology commonly used is the comparison method which is based on comparable historical transactions adjusted for specific market factors such as selling prices of recent transactions, historical transaction prices of similar properties of nearby location, any adjustments for tenure, location, development concept and size. The investment method involves the projection of a series of cash flows on a real property interest. To this projected cash flow series, an appropriate, market-derived discount rate is applied to establish the present value of the income stream associated with the real property.

Information regarding the valuation techniques and inputs used in determining the fair value is disclosed in note 6 to the financial statements.

# Amortisation and impairment of concession assets

The carrying amount of concession assets is amortised over the concession period by applying the formula in note 3.6. The denominator of the formula includes projected total traffic volume for subsequent years to the end of the concession period and is based on the latest available base case traffic volume projection prepared by independent traffic consultants. The assumptions to arrive at the traffic volume projection take into consideration the growth rate based on current market and economic conditions. Changes in the expected traffic volume could impact future amortisation charges.

The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indicator that the concession assets are impaired. If such an indication exists, an estimation of the recoverable amount is required. Estimating the recoverable amount requires management to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows generated from the concession assets discounted at a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.

# Measurement of inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The Group estimates the net realisable value of inventories based on an assessment of expected selling prices.

Inventories are reviewed on a regular basis and the Group will write down the inventories based primarily on historical trends and management estimates of expected and future product demand and related pricing.

Demand levels, changes in product preference and pricing competition could change from time to time. If such factors result in an adverse effect on the Group's inventories, the Group might be required to reduce the value of its inventories and additional write down for slow-moving inventories may be required.

# Measurement of land held for property development

Land held for property development is stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. The Group estimates the net realisable value of land held for property development based on assessment of expected market prices for similar land, less estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

Land held for property development is reviewed on a regular basis and the Group will write down its carrying amount primarily based on historical trends and management estimates of expected and future demand and related pricing.

# Measurement of impairment loss on investments in subsidiaries

Investments in subsidiaries are assessed at the end of each reporting period to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If such an indication exists, an estimation of the investment's recoverable amount is required. Estimating the recoverable amount requires management to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the Company's investments in subsidiaries and also choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.

# Deferred tax assets

Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences, unabsorbed capital allowances and unutilised tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available in future against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilised.

Significant management judgement, is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies.

# Determining the loss allowance for trade receivables and contract assets

Management assesses the ECL for trade receivables and contract assets at each reporting date. Credit losses are the difference between the contractual cash flows that are due to the entity and the cash flows that it actually expects to receive. Management applies simplified approach of MFRS 9 Financial Instruments in assessing the impairment of trade receivables and contract assets.

In determining the ECL, management uses historical credit loss experience for trade receivables and contract assets to estimate the ECL. Management is not only required to consider historical information that is adjusted to reflect the effects of current conditions and information that provides objective evidence that trade receivables and contract assets are impaired in relation to incurred losses, but management is also considering, when applicable, reasonable and supportable information that may include forecasts of future economic conditions when estimating the ECL, on an individual and collective basis. The need to consider forward-looking information means that management exercises considerable judgement as to how changes in macroeconomic factors will affect the ECL on trade receivables and contract assets.

The ECL on trade receivables and contract assets as at current reporting date is primarily mainly based upon the historical credit loss experience.

# 4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES (CONT'D)

# Determining the loss allowance for non-trade receivables

Management assesses the ECL of receivables (other than trade receivables and lease receivables) at each reporting date. Credit losses are the difference between the contractual cash flows that are due to the entity and the cash flows that it actually expects to receive.

In determining the ECL, management assesses whether there has been any significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition of a receivable. Where there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, management determines the loss allowance by estimating an amount equal to 12-month ECL of that receivable. For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in the likelihood or risk of a default occurring since initial recognition (instead of on evidence of a financial asset being credit-impaired at the reporting date or an actual default occurring), management measures a loss allowance for credit losses expected over the remaining life of that receivable. Management exercises considerable judgement in these estimations, using historical credit loss experience as well as reasonable and supportable information that may include forecasts of future economic conditions when estimating the ECL.

# Provision for heavy repairs

Provision for heavy repairs is recognised based on the future heavy repairs expenditure expected to be incurred over the concession period. Judgement and estimation are involved in determining the timing and amounts of future expenditure taking into consideration factors such as usage of expressway, technology changes, inflation and etc.

# Income taxes

Significant judgement is involved in determining the capital allowances and deductibility of expenses during the estimation of the provision for income tax. There are certain transactions and computations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business.

The Group and the Company recognise liabilities for expected tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recognised, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.

# Lease liability

Management estimates the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease together with both periods covered by an option to extend the lease and an option to terminate the lease. In assessing whether it is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend a lease, or not to exercise an option to terminate a lease, management exercises judgement by considering all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise the option to extend the lease, or not to exercise the option to terminate the lease.

Management measures the lease liability as the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at commencement date. The lease payments are discounted using the incremental borrowing rate.

The lease terms and discount rate are determined using certain assumptions and they represent management's best estimation. The assumptions on which it is based relate to the future. Actual outcome may be different from the estimation and the variation could be material.

# Impairment of goodwill

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and at other times when such indicators exist. This requires management to estimate the expected future cash flows of the cash-generating until to which goodwill is allocated and to apply a suitable discount rate in order to determine the present value of those cash flows.

(c) Impairment testing on plant and machinery used for food and beverages business.

The Group's food and beverage operations was impacted by varying degree of restrictions imposed by the Government of Malaysia due to Covid-19 pandemic and changes in market demand. The Group has identified each restaurant outlet as cash generating unit ("CGU") which comprised plant and equipment and right-of-use assets. The Group has carried out impairment assessments on each CGU when there are indications for impairment.

The Group estimated the recoverable amounts of each CGU based on the value in-use ("VIU"). The VIU has been calculated using the cash flow projections covering 5 years period. Cash flow that beyond 5 years period have been extrapolated using terminal growth rate.

Key assumptions used in the VIU calculation are as follows:

<table><tr><td></td><td>2023</td><td>2022</td></tr><tr><td>Discount rate (pre-tax)</td><td>15.50%</td><td>13.40%</td></tr><tr><td>Terminal growth rate</td><td>3.30%</td><td>3.30%</td></tr></table>

In the financial year ended 30 June 2023, the management assessed recoverable amount to be higher than the underlying net carrying amounts, and accordingly no impairment loss recognised.

In previous financial years, impairment losses of RM626,000 and RM441,000 have been recognised on plant and equipment and right-of-use assets.

The sensitivity of the impairment assessment to a reasonably possible change in the key input  $5\%$  decrease in projected revenue, would not cause the recoverable amount of the CGU to differ materiality from its carrying amount as at 30 June 2023.

(i) The comparison method entails critical analyses of recent evidence of values of comparable properties in the nearby location, and where necessary, adjusting for differences, such as tenure, location, development concept, and size, among others.  
(ii) The investment method entails the determination of the probable gross annual rental the property is capable of producing and deducting therefrom the outgoing to arrive at the annual net income.

The fair value of investment properties classified under level 2 was determined using comparison method, and level 3 was determined using cost or investment method.

There is no transfer between levels of fair value hierarchy during the financial year.

# (i) Contract farming business

# Perfect Sunworld Sdn Bhd

PSSB's contract farming activities for the durian plantation was loss making in the current and previous year/period, mainly due to lower yields and rehabilitation works undertaken by management to improve the yields as the durian plantation was in less than optimal conditions since previous durian season.

The management has performed the impairment assessment and has recognised an impairment loss of RM200,000 (2022: RM1,300,000) for the financial year ended 30 June 2023.

- Cash flow projections were prepared based on past experience, actual and future expected operating results for durian plantation;  
- Estimated a stable selling price annually for each type of durian species based on historical past year data and current market selling price;

- Estimated the yield of production based on the key assumptions including fruit weight, grade, species, number of mature durian trees and mortality rate in accordance with management's experience based on the existing condition of the plantation; and  
A pre-tax discount rate of  $9\%$  (2022: 9%) per annum.

The sensitivity of the impairment assessment to a reasonably possible change in each of the key inputs (i.e. selling price decreased by  $5\%$ , production volume decreased by  $5\%$ , discount rate increased by  $1\%$ , respectively) would not cause the recoverable amount to differ materially as at 30 June 2023.

# Impairment Testing on Park and Ride Building

During the financial year, as a result of deferment of commencement of park and ride operation, the Group performed an impairment assessment of the carrying amount of the park and ride building by comparing the discounted future cash flows attributable to the park and ride building against the carrying amount. The assessment has shown that the recoverable amount of park and ride building is lower than the carrying amount. The impairment test led to the recognition of an impairment loss of RM9,147,000 (2022: RM7,494,000) in profit or loss.

The recoverable amount of park and ride building is determined based on a value-in-use calculation, using cash flow projection from financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year period.

Key assumptions used for value-in-use calculation for park and ride building are as follows:

<table><tr><td></td><td>2023</td><td>2022</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-tax discount rate</td><td>8.0%</td><td>5.7%</td></tr><tr><td>Revenue growth rate</td><td>5.0%</td><td>5.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Terminal growth rate</td><td>1.4%</td><td>1.4%</td></tr></table>

# (b) Impairment review

The Group performs impairment review on the carrying amount of bearer plants at each reporting date to assess whether there are any indications of impairment. When indication of impairment exist, the management assessed the recoverable amount of the respective CGU based on VIU using discounted cash flows projections.

# Rubber trees

An indirect subsidiary of the Company, Aramijaya has planted rubber trees in various estates commencing from year 2012.

The management had carried an impairment review of its rubber segment which had experienced indicators of impairment. Based on the review, it was found that certain areas of rubber planted in earlier years were not in favourable field conditions with considerable delays in achieving the appropriate girth, which adversely affected the financial performance of the rubber segment.

An assessment of recoverable amount had been prepared based on discounted future cash flows derived from the sales of logs and latex. In determining the VIU calculation, the key assumptions used are as follows:

- Projected future cash flows over the remaining life span of the rubber trees prior to harvesting;  
Average selling price for latex and log based on historical past years data and market selling price;  
Average latex production ranging from 200 to 900 (2022: 200 to 1,200) metrics tonnes per year; and  
A pre-tax discount rate of  $9\%$  (2022:  $9\%$ ) per annum.

Correspondingly, an impairment loss of RM1,820,000 (2022: Nil), representing the write-down of the carrying amount of the identified rubber site to the recoverable amount was recognised in the financial year ended 30 June 2023.

The sensitivity of the impairment assessment to a reasonably possible change in each of the key inputs (i.e. selling price decreased by  $5\%$  and girth measurement decreased by  $5\%$ , respectively) would not cause the recoverable amount to differ materially as at 30 June 2023.

# Durian trees

An indirect subsidiary of the Company, Jasa Indahmas Sdn. Bhd. had completed the acquisition of the durian plantation, including the durian trees accounted as bearer plant.

Rehabilitation works had to be undertaken by the management to improve the yields as the plantation acquired at the time was in less-than-optimal conditions, and in turn adversely affected its financial performance.

In the impairment assessment, the management engaged an independent valuer to determine the recoverable amount of the asset based on a 50-year discounted future cash flows derived from the sales of fresh durian based on the remaining life span of the durian trees.

In determining the fair value less cost to sell calculation, the key assumptions used are as follows:

- Cash flow projections were prepared based on past experience, actual and future expected operating results for durian plantation;  
- Estimated the average selling price of each type of durian species based on historical past year data and current market selling price;

# Durian trees (Cont'd)

In determining the fair value less cost to sell calculation, the key assumptions used are as follows: (Cont'd)

- Estimated the yield of production based on the key assumptions including fruit weight, grade, species, number of mature durian trees and mortality rate in accordance with management's experience based on the existing condition of the plantation; and  
A pre-tax discount rate of  $6.1\%$  (2022:  $7.5\%$ ) per annum.

Based on the impairment assessment, the recoverable amount of the durian trees CGU was estimated to be higher than the carrying amount of the assets, and accordingly no impairment loss was recognised in the financial year ended 30 June 2023 and 30 June 2022.

Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which the recoverable amount of the CGU asset is based on would not cause the carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amounts.

(c) The bearer plants with a net carrying amount of RM5,489,000 (2022: RM5,601,000) have been pledged as security to secure term loan of the Group as disclosed in notes 31 and 39.  
(d) In the previous financial year, the Group engaged independent professionals to conduct a full census to remeasure the number and condition of oil palm trees as well the planted area.

As a result, the differential between the Acreage Statement as maintained by the management compared to the Census Report produced by the independent professionals were written off to Group's cost of sales within statements of comprehensive income amounting RM2,964,000 for the financial year ended 30 June 2022, including a portion related to oil palm crops damaged by the intrusion of wild animals.

# Goodwill (Cont'd)

The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit are determined using the VIU approach, and this is derived from the present value of the future cash flows from the cash-generating units computed based on the projections of financial budgets approved by management. The key assumptions used in the determination of the recoverable amount are as follows:

# Aramijaya

- Projected future cash flows over the remaining life span of the various crops, of which oil palm is the most significant contributor;  
Average selling prices of fresh fruit bunches price for past 3 years being used for the forecast and projection years;  
Growth rate based on management's estimate of commodity prices, oil palm yields and oil extraction rates;  
- Development and direct costs estimated based on past practices and experience;  
Average palm yields ranging from 117,000 to 160,000 (2022: 116,000 to 164,000) metric tonnes per year; and  
A pre-tax discount rate of  $6.0\%$  (2022:  $5.8\%$ ) per annum.

Based on the impairment assessment, the recoverable amount of Aramijaya's CGU was estimated to be higher than the carrying amount of the asset, and accordingly no impairment loss was recognised in the financial year ended 30 June 2023 and 30 June 2022.

# Dulai

- Cash flow projections were prepared based on past experience and, actual and future expected operating results for fruit trading business;  
- The selling price and operation cost were assumed to be consistently applied;  
The gross profit margin was projected at  $9.0\%$  (2022:  $10.6\%$ );  
The expected credit loss projected at  $4.0\%$  (2022: Nil); and  
A pre-tax discount rate of  $11.2\%$  (2022:  $13.0\%$ ) per annum.

Based on the impairment assessment, the Group recognised an impairment loss of RM16,699,000 (2022: Nil) to write-down the carrying amount of the goodwill derived from the previous year acquisition in Dulai for the financial year ended 30 June 2023.

In the previous financial year, the recoverable amount was estimated to be higher than the carrying amount of the CGU asset, and accordingly no impairment loss was recognised in the financial year ended 30 June 2022.

# GFSB

The directors are of the view the disclosure of the key assumption used in determination of the recoverable amount of GFSB is immaterial to be presented.

During the financial year, total goodwill written off amounted to RM101,000 was recognised based on impairment test performed.

# Impairment Loss on Investment in EPR

During the financial year, EPR incurred a loss of RM10 million (2022: RM8 million) and also as a result of deferment of commencement of park and ride operation, the Company performed an impairment assessment of the carrying amount of the investment in EPR by comparing the discounted future cash flows of the park and ride operation against the carrying amount. The assessment has shown that the recoverable amount of investment in EPR is lower than the carrying amount. The impairment test led to the recognition of an impairment loss of RM14 million (2022: RM16 million) in profit or loss.

The recoverable amount of investment in EPR is determined based on a VIU calculation, using cash flow projection from financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year period. The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projection is  $11.1\%$  (2022: 10.9%).

Key assumptions used for VIU calculation for investment in EPR are as follows:

<table><tr><td></td><td>2023</td><td>2022</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-tax discount rate</td><td>11.1%</td><td>10.9%</td></tr><tr><td>Revenue growth rate</td><td>5.0%</td><td>5.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Terminal growth rate</td><td>1.4%</td><td>1.4%</td></tr></table>

# (a) Compensation of shortfall from profit guarantee

Pursuant to the Profit Guarantee Stakeholder Agreement, the non-controlling interest shareholder (hereby also referred as the "Vendor") of Dulai had provided a minimum Guaranteed Profit of amounting to RM10 million for a period of three (3) years covering from 31 March 2020 to 31 March 2022 ("guaranteed financial years"), whereby, at the lapse of guaranteed financial years, any shortfall from the guaranteed profit will be compensated by the Vendor.

In the previous financial year, the directors of the PLS and the Vendor have entered into a Supplemental Profit Guarantee Stakeholder Agreement to vary the terms of the aboveaod Profit Guarantee Stakeholder Agreement whereby an agreed interim compensation of approximately RM3 million pursuant to the shortfall in profit guarantee calculated up to 31 March 2021 has been paid and have mutually agreed that the remaining profit guarantee balance is to be approximately RM7.5 million after taking into consideration certain agreed adjustments, and with an extension of time to 31 March 2023 provided to fulfil the remaining obligations under the abovementioned agreement.

In the previous financial year, the directors of the PLS and the Vendor have agreed to a compensation of approximately RM8 million pursuant to the shortfall in profit guarantee calculated up to 31 March 2022 and the calculation of the shortfall has adjusted an impairment loss from uncollected sales which occurred during the financial period ended 30 June 2021. As at 30 June 2022, PLS had received the said shortfall payment of approximately RM8 million from the Vendor and, as stated in the Supplemental letter dated 5 May 2022, the remaining profit guarantee amounting to approximately RM391,000 has been fulfilled by the Vendor by end of 31 March 2023.

# The Josu proceedings

On 18 December 2002, PLS had terminated a sub-contractor, Josu Engineering Construction Sdn. Bhd. ("the Defendant"), for failure to complete certain sub-contracted works in accordance with the agreed schedule. The termination was accepted by the Defendant, and in accordance with the terms of the subcontract, PLS engaged other contractors to complete the said sub-contracted works.  
On 6 August 2007, PLS filed a suit against the Defendant, claiming a sum of RM10,303,000 for damages incurred by PLS in completing the sub-contracted works. The Defendant is counter-claiming a sum of RM11,612,000 being damages allegedly suffered.  
On 21 November 2012, PLS had filed an application to amend its writ and statement of claim to include a prayer for pre-judgment interests and was allowed by the High Court and the matter was fixed for full trial.  
However, on 5 December 2012, both parties have entered into a Consent Order to refer the matter to an arbitrator for determination. The Arbitrator had decided based on the Interim Award on Liability dated 13 November 2017 ("Interim Award"), amongst others, that neither party is entitled to terminate the sub-contract and that PLS's termination of the sub-contract was wrongful and therefore not valid.  
The hearing dates in respect of quantum have yet to be fixed. On 22 December 2017, an application to challenge had been made to High Court, Kuala Lumpur to refer questions of law arising from the Interim Award pursuant to Section 42 of the Arbitration Act 2005. On 23 September 2019 both the parties complete their oral submission.  
On 27 November 2019, the learned Judicial Commissioner was inclined to agree with the Defendant and dismissed the PLS's application with costs subject to allocator fees. The learned Judicial Commissioner was of the view that the plaintiff's questions of law posed in its application were not within the context of section 42 of the Arbitration Act 2005 and had no merits.  
On 16 October 2020, the Court informed that the hearing date for the appeal on 22 October 2020 has been vacated and a case management by way of e-Review was fixed on 3 November 2020.  
On 3 November 2020, a case management was conducted by way of e-Review and the Court had proceeded to fix the matter for hearing on 17 September 2021.  
On 17 September 2021, the Court fixed a new hearing date to 26 November 2021 with no further case management as both parties have filed their respective written submission.

# The Josu proceedings (Cont'd)

On 26 November 2021, the following related appeals came up for hearing together before the Court of Appeal Construction Panel:

(i) the appeal against the High Court's dismissal of the Defendant's striking out application ("Josu's Appeal"). By way of brief background, the Defendant had filed an interlocutory application during the High Court proceeding to strike out PLS's application filed pursuant to Section 42 of the Arbitration Act 2005 to refer questions of law arising from the interim arbitral Award in question ("PLS's Substantive Application"). The said striking out application was dismissed by the learned Judicial Commissioner (as she then was) and the Defendant appealed against the same to the Court of Appeal i.e. Civil Appeal No. W-02(IM)(C)-1527-08/2019; and  
(ii) the appeal against the High Court's dismissal of PLS's Substantive Application ("PLS's Appeal") i.e. Civil Appeal No. W-02(C)(A)-2269-12/2019

The Honorable Court allowed Josu's Appeal with costs, thus setting aside the decision of the learned Judicial Commissioner (as she then was). The Court of Appeal held, inter-alia, that the arbitration was conducted strictly pursuant to Section 24A of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964 and that the Arbitration Act 2005 has no application in a court-ordered arbitration. Therefore, the Court of Appeal agreed with the Defendant's contention that the High Court of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur lacked jurisdiction to hear PLS's Substantive Application filed therein.

Following therefrom, the Court of Appeal held that there was no basis to proceed with PLS's Appeal as the Defendant's application to strike out PLS's Substantive Application was allowed. PLS's Appeal was therefore dismissed with costs.

Arising from the Court of Appeal's decision on 26 November 2021 in allowing the Defendant striking out appeal and in turn, dismissing PLS's Substantive Appeal, PLS had instructed its solicitors to file an application for leave to appeal to the Federal Court against the said decision of the Court of Appeal.

PLS has been apprised by its solicitors that two (2) Notices of Motion were filed in the Federal Court on 27 December 2021 as follows:

(i) Application No. 08(f)-702-12/2021(W) - for leave to appeal against the said Court of Appeal's decision in allowing the Defendant Appeal to strike out PLS's substantive application filed before the High Court to refer questions of law arising from the interim arbitral award in question; and  
(ii) Application No. 08(f)-703-12/2021(W) - for leave to appeal against the Court of Appeal's decision in dismissing PLS's Appeal solely on the basis that Josu's Appeal was allowed and without hearing PLS's Appeal on its merits.

On 26 January 2022, both the above leave applications filed by PLS came up for case management before the learned Deputy Registrar wherein the following directions were handed down:

(i) affidavit are to be exhausted by 22 February 2022;  
(ii) parties are to file their respective Written Submissions and other relevant documents by 29 April 2022;  
(iii) both the leave applications will be heard together on 19 May 2022; and  
(iv) a further case management by way of e-Review has been fixed for 9 May 2022.

On 9 May 2022, the leave applications filed by PLS came up for case management before the learned Deputy Registrar wherein a new hearing date was fixed for the same on 16 August 2022.

On 1 August 2022, the leave applications filed by PLS came up for case management before the learned Deputy Registrar. Given that the Grounds of Judgment from the Court of Appeal ("Grounds") is still pending, the hearing fixed for 16 August 2022 was vacated upon the parties' request for the same. The Court then proceeded to fix another case management on 21 September 2022 for parties to apprise the Court on the status of the Grounds and to fix a new Hearing date.

# The Josu proceedings (Cont'd)

The Federal Court, having heard both parties on 26 June 2023 held that Application No. 08(f)-702-12/2021(W) and Application No. 08(f)-703-12/2021(W) failed to satisfy the thresholds of Section 96(a) of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964 and proceeded to dismiss the aforesaid applications with costs in favour of the Defendant.

The Group has consulted its solicitors on the next course of action in respect of the pending arbitration proceeding.

Relying on the advice of the solicitors, the directors of the Company believe that PLS has a good chance of succeeding in its suit.

# Financial assets and financial liabilities that are not measured at fair value

The fair value of medium-term notes of the Group and of the Company at the end of the financial year is approximately RM5,996 million and RM273 million (2022: RM5,943 million and RM150 million) respectively. The carrying amounts of other financial assets and liabilities as at the end of the financial reporting period approximate or were at their fair values due to the relatively short-term maturity or the related interest rates are at/approximate market rate on these financial instruments.

The fair value of medium-term notes is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows at current market rate available for similar instrument, which is included within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

# 55. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES

The Group's and the Company's activities are exposed to a variety of financial risks, including interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risks, foreign currency risk and agricultural risk on biological assets. The Group's and the Company's overall financial risk management objective and policies are to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group and the Company and to create value and maximise returns to its shareholders.

Financial risk management is carried out through risk reviews, internal control systems, benchmarking the industry's best performance, insurance programmes and adherence to financial risk management policies.

The Group and the Company have been financing their operations mainly from internally generated funds, issuance of medium-term notes and bank borrowings. The Group and the Company do not find it necessary to enter into derivative transactions based on their current level of operations.

The management monitors the Group's and the Company's financial position closely with an objective to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group and the Company. There have been no significant changes on the Group's and the Company's exposure to financial risks from the previous year. Also, there have been no changes to the Group's and the Company's risk management objectives, policies and processes since the previous financial year end.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2023

# 55. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONT'D)

The Group's and the Company's management reviews and agrees on policies managing each of the financial risks and they are summarised as follows:

# (a) Interest rate risk

The Group and the Company are exposed to interest rate risk which is the risk that a financial instrument's value will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates.

Exposure to interest rate risk relates the Group's and the Company's interest-bearing borrowings and medium term note.

# Financial liabilities

The Group's and the Company's policy is to borrow principally on a floating rate basis but to retain a proportion of fixed rate borrowings. The objective of a mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings is to reduce the impact of an upward change in interest rates while enabling benefits to be enjoyed if interest rates fall. The mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings are monitored so as to ensure that the Group's and the Company's financing costs are kept at the lowest possible. The Group and the Company do not generally hedge interest rate risks. Hedging of risk through the use of financial instruments may be adopted should its use result in significant cost savings. The Group and the Company have a policy to ensure that interest rates obtained are competitive.

A sensitivity analysis has been performed based on the outstanding floating rate bank borrowings of the Group and the Company as at 30 June 2023. If interest rates increase or decrease by 100 basis points with all other variable held constant, the Group's and the Company's profit after tax would decrease or increase by RM6,523,000 and RM3,667,000 (2022: RM7,154,000 and RM3,947,000), respectively, as a result of higher or lower interest expense on these borrowings.

The sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the inherent interest rate risk as the year-end exposure does not reflect the exposure during the financial year.

# (b) Credit risk

Credit risk arises from the possibility that a counter party may be unable to meet the terms of a contract in which the Group and the Company have a gain position.

The entire financial assets and contract assets of the Group and the Company are exposed to credit risk.

# Trade receivables

The Group's and the Company's exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. The Group and the Company have credit risk policies in place to manage credit risk exposure. The risk is managed through the application of the Group's and the Company's credit management procedures which include regular monitoring and follow up procedures.

An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date to measure the ECL. The calculation reflects information that is available at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.

The Group and the Company carefully select the projects in which they intend to participate. The selection is based on criteria that are reviewed periodically to take into account developments in the market. The Group and the Company also manage their credit risk exposure by maintaining good business relationship with its customers and debtors. This approach has enabled the Group and the Company to manage their credit risk more effectively in addition to the above credit risk management procedures.

# (c) Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group or the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations when they fall due.

To manage and mitigate the liquidity risk, the Group's management seeks to ensure all business units within the Group maintain optimum levels of liquidity at all times, sufficient for their operating, investing and financing activities. Therefore, the management monitors the Group's operations actively to ensure that each business unit, through efficient working capital management (i.e. accounts receivable and accounts payable management), must be able to convert its assets into cash to meet all demands for payment as and when they fall due.

The management monitors the current ratio and gearing ratio of the Group and of the Company continuously. The management monitors and forecasts cash commitments; and monitors and maintains a level of cash and cash equivalents deemed adequate to finance the Group's operating and investing activities. Each business unit is required to submit cash flow forecast to the management periodically. Each business unit must seek to ensure that projected cash inflows from operating and non-operating activities (including undrawn credit facilities) adequately cover funding requirements of operating and non-operating cash outflows. At a minimum, all projected short-term borrowings should be covered by the projected cash inflows. The management closely monitors the debt maturities to ensure that the Group and the Company are able to meet their financial obligations as they fall due.

The Group and the Company strive to maintain available credit facilities at a reasonable level against their overall debt position. As of the end of the current reporting period, the Group has unutilised credit facility up to RM80 million (2022: RM30 million). Based on the management's current assessment, there has been no breach of covenants and the unutilised credit facility will be available as and when necessary in the foreseeable future.

Other than the management actively manages the cash flows of the Group and of the Company, the management constantly looks for alternative sources of funds to meet its financial obligation and to finance its business operations. Other than cash generated from operating activities, the management also generate cash from realisation of the Group's and the Company's assets when necessary.

The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group's and the Company's financial liabilities based on the contractual undiscounted cash flows.

# (c) Liquidity risk (Cont'd)

As at 30 June 2023, the Group and the Company reported net current liabilities of RM134 million and RM1,368 million respectively. Nevertheless, the directors of the Company believe that the Group and the Company are able to meet all their financial obligations as and when they fall due in the foreseeable future. In reaching the above conclusion, the directors have carried out a thorough assessment of the financial position, forecast and plan of the Group and of the Company up to the date of approval of these financial statements.

Based on the assessment, the net current liabilities position is mainly attributable to expressway concession, construction and property segments of the Group, while the plantation segment is financially self-sustainable. In the assessment of the Group's and of the Company's liquidity and financial position, the directors evaluated and considered the following events, plan and forecast of the Group and of the Company up to the date of approval of these financial statements:

1. In August 2023, the Company raised net cash proceeds of RM19 million from the disposal of 21,000,000 ordinary shares in PLS as disclosed in note 58(i) to the financial statements.  
2. In September 2023, the Company raised net cash proceeds of RM114 million through the issuance of 269,582,800 new ordinary shares in the Company as disclosed in note 58(ii) to the financial statements.  
3. Net cash inflows expected from the Group's expressway concession, construction and property segments for twelve months after the date of approval of these financial statements.  
4. Subsequent to 30 June 2023, a new credit facility up to RM148 million has been obtained from a financial institution for the purpose of a proposed mixed development project of the Group.  
5. Based on the track record and covenant assessment of the existing credit facilities, the directors foresee the revolving credits of the Group and of the Company amounted to RM255 million and RM250 million respective as at 30 June 2023 will be rolled forward by the lender at the request of the Group and of the Company for a period not less than twelve months after the date of approval of these financial statements.  
6. Unutilised credit facility up to RM80 million available to be Group.  
7. In order to further strengthen the financial position of the Group and to stay focused on its core businesses, the management is exploring opportunities to dispose of non-core assets of the Group.

Based on assessment above, the directors of the Company are of the view that the liquidity position of the Group and of the Company is manageable and they do not foresee any significant liquidity risk or material uncertainty exist that may cast significant doubt about the Group's and the Company's ability to meet their financial obligations for at least twelve months after the date of approval of these financial statements.

The table below summarised issued financial guarantee contracts of the Company, which represent the maximum amounts of the guarantees, and is allocated to the earliest period in which the guarantees could be called. However, based on circumstances at the end of the reporting period, the directors do not foresee the guarantees will be called.

# (d) Foreign currency risk

The Group undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Consequently, the Group is exposed to risk arising from fluctuation of exchange rates.

The Group does not consider it necessary to hedge against the foreign currency exchange risk based on its current level of operations.

The following table illustrates the Group's sensitivity to changes in exchange rate of RM against the relevant currencies on the material outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items. Management has considered recent volatility in exchange rates and has concluded that the following movements in exchange rates are reasonably possible assumption. If the following foreign currencies were to strengthen by  $5\%$  against RM with all other variables held constant, the Group's profit after tax would decrease or increase as follows:

<table><tr><td>(Decrease)/Increase</td><td>2023

The sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the inherent foreign currency risk as the year-end exposure does not reflect the exposure during the financial year.

# (e) Agricultural risk on biological assets

The Group is exposed to risks arising from environmental and climatic changes, commodity prices and financing risks arising mainly from the oil palm and durian assets.

The Group is exposed to risks arising from fluctuations in the price and demand of FFB.

The seasonal nature of the durian plantation and trading business requires a high level of cash flows to be reserved by the Group during the durian seasons. The Group actively manages the working capital requirements and has secured sufficient credit facilities to meet the cash flow requirements.

Management actively monitors and manages the risks relating to the plantation business segment. The reasonable risk exposure due to changes in external factors are not expected to have significant financial impact to the Group in the near future.

# MATERIAL

# LITIGATION

# OF EKOVEST BERHAD AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES

Save as disclosed below as at 30 June 2023, neither the Company nor its subsidiaries are engaged in any material litigation, claims or arbitration, either as plaintiff or defendant and the Board are not aware and do not have any knowledge of any proceedings, pending or threatened against the Group or any facts likely to give rise to any proceedings which might materially and adversely affect the financial position or business of the Company and its subsidiaries :

(i) On 3 July 2018, Ekovest Construction Sdn Bhd ("ECSB"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of our Company, had initiated an arbitration proceeding against Saraworks Sdn Bhd ("previously known as Samling Resources Sdn Bhd) ("SSB") by serving a Notice of Arbitration on SSB. Thereafter, ECSB had on 2 July 2019 filed a Statement of Case to claim against SSB based on the following:

(a) ‘wrongful termination of the joint venture and shareholders’ agreement dated 6 January 2017 entered into between ECSB and SSB (“JV Agreement”) to jointly undertake the development and upgrading of the Pan Borneo Highway in the state of Sarawak, Malaysia for work package contract WPC-02 (Semantan to Sg. Moyan Bridge + KSR Interchanges) (“Highway Project”);  
(b) misrepresentation by SSB to ECSB, in order to induce ECSB into performing tasks, duties and responsibilities of SSB prior to the submission of the tender; the procurement of the Highway Project from Lebuhraya Borneo Utara Sdn Bhd ("LBUSB"), the project delivery partner for the Highway Project; and managing the Highway Project and all its ensuing duties and tasks;  
(c) failure to expeditiously and diligently make the necessary applications for the approvals from LBUSB for the sub-contract of the Highway Project to Samling – Ekovest JV Sdn Bhd, a special purpose vehicle incorporated by ECSB and SSB to undertake the development and upgrading of the Highway Project (“JV Company”); and  
(d) in the alternative, failure to take any step to compel LBUSB to consent to the sub-contract of the Highway Project to the JV Company, which should not have been unreasonably withheld, in which ECSB claims for general damages, interest and costs to be determined by the arbitrator ("Arbitration Proceedings").

The hearing in relation to the Arbitration Proceeding which was fixed from 29 September 2020 to 2 October 2020 were vacated following the order of the Court as detailed in item (ii) below.

On 12 January 2022, SSB had initiated an arbitration proceeding against ECSB by serving a new Notice of Arbitration on ECSB, claiming against ECSB for, amongst others, the following:

(a) negligent misrepresentation and/or misstatements;  
(b) breach of duty of care, fiduciary duties, duties under common law and equity;  
(c) breach of the JV Agreement; and  
(d) breach of a collateral agreement between the parties.

ECSB had challenged the validity of the aforesaid notice on grounds that SSB's attempt to initiate this fresh arbitration tantamount to duplicity and is an abuse of process.

The parties reached a global settlement. On 12 May 2023, the parties, via a letter dated 12 May 2023 from the solicitors for ECSB to the Arbitrator in ECSB's arbitral proceedings, jointly sought the termination of the ECSB's arbitral proceedings. SSB also via its solicitors' letter dated 12 May 2023 to Asian International Arbitration Centre ("AIAC") sought to terminate the SSB's arbitral proceedings. On 19 May 2023, AIAC issued a letter and informed that the matter is closed. On 12 June 2023, the Arbitrator issued a termination order to terminate the arbitral proceedings.

# MATERIAL LITIGATION

OF EKOVEST BERHAD AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES

Save as disclosed below as at 30 June 2023, neither the Company nor its subsidiaries are engaged in any material litigation, claims or arbitration, either as plaintiff or defendant and the Board are not aware and do not have any knowledge of any proceedings, pending or threatened against the Group or any facts likely to give rise to any proceedings which might materially and adversely affect the financial position or business of the Company and its subsidiaries : (Cont'd)

(ii) On 3 February 2020, our Company and ECSB were served by the solicitors of SSB with a Writ of summons and Statement of Claim dated 31 January 2020 ("Claim") alleging that our Company and/or ECSB:

(aa) were negligent in their representation and/or assurances with regards to the technical advice and support and profit margin for the Highway Project;  
(bb) failed, neglected and/or omitted to discharge their responsibilities with due care and diligence in the implementation and execution of the Highway Project;  
(cc) acted in breach of their fiduciary duties owed to SSB, including inter alia, the duties under common law and equity; and/or  
(dd) breached and misrepresented in respect of the sub-contractors that were selected, recommended and appointed to carry out the sub-contract works of the Highway Project.

SSB as plaintiff is claiming against our Company and ECSB as defendants jointly and severally for:

- general damages;  
- interest at the rate of  $5\%$  per annum pursuant to Section 11 of the Civil Law Act 1956 or at such rate and from such date as the court deems fit and proper until the date of judgement;  
interest at the rate of  $5 \%$  per annum from the date of judgement until the date of full and final settlement;  
costs; and  
such further and/or other relief as the court deems fit and proper.

ECSB and our Company had on 13 February 2020 and 14 February 2020 respectively filed our/its application for a stay of proceedings of the Claim pending the Arbitration Proceeding ("Stay Applications"). During the case management held on 21 April 2020, the Deputy Registrar further directed parties to file their respective affidavit and submissions, and had fixed the hearing of the Stay Applications to be on 6 July 2020. The hearing of the Stay Applications was then adjourned to 13 July 2020. Further to the filing of the written submissions and reply submissions by the parties' solicitors, the parties' solicitors also submitted orally and addressed the High Court Judge's questions during the hearing fixed on 13 July 2020. Thereafter, the High Court Judge fixed the Clarification/Decision for the Stay Applications on 30 July 2020. On 30 July 2020, the High Court Judge dismissed the Company's application for a stay of proceedings; and the High Court Judge allowed ECSB's application for a stay of proceedings but imposed a condition that the arbitration between ECSB and SSB shall only proceed after the resolution of SSB's claim against the Company at Kuala Lumpur High Court.

On 25 August 2020, the Company has filed its notice of appeal to appeal against the decision of the High Court that dismissed the Company's Stay Application ("Company's Appeal"), and ECSB had also filed its notice of appeal to appeal partly against the condition imposed by the High Court when allowing ECSB's Stay Application. The Company and ECSB were advised that the Company's Stay Application and also the ECSB's Stay Application should be allowed given that the matters to be decided in the aforementioned proceedings are one of the same and that any contradiction in the decisions arising therefrom would unfairly prejudice one party's claim against each other.

Notwithstanding the aforesaid, the Court of Appeal had on 25 November 2021 (after reading the parties' respective written submissions together with all relevant documents) (a) allowed ECSB's appeal and set aside the condition imposed by the High Court Judge that the arbitration between ECSB and SSB shall only proceed after the resolution of SSB's Claim against the Company at the Kuala Lumpur High Court ("Set Aside Decision"); and (b) dismissed the Company's Appeal as the Court of Appeal was of the view that the High Court proceedings between SSB and the Company could proceed.

A final Case Management is fixed on 25 October 2022 to update the Court Registrar on the filing of the written submission. The Hearing of both the Company's Motion and SSB's Motion at the Federal Court is fixed on 8 November 2022.

The Court Registrar fixed a Case Management on 7 February 2023 to update the Court Registrar on the filing of the written submissions (which have been filed on 20 October 2022) and the Hearing of both the Company's Motion and SSB's Motion at the Federal Court was fixed on 22 February 2023.

On 22 February 2023, during the Hearing, the Company through its solicitors made a request for an adjournment of the Hearing as the parties are in the midst of settlement. The Honourable Federal Court Judge, after hearing the oral submissions and explanation, allowed the Company's request for an adjournment of the Hearing and directed the parties' solicitors to appear before the Court Registrar on the same day to fix a new Hearing date. The Hearing of both the Company's Motion and SSB's Motion at the Federal Court was fixed on 17 May 2023.

Save as disclosed below as at 30 June 2023, neither the Company nor its subsidiaries are engaged in any material litigation, claims or arbitration, either as plaintiff or defendant and the Board are not aware and do not have any knowledge of any proceedings, pending or threatened against the Group or any facts likely to give rise to any proceedings which might materially and adversely affect the financial position or business of the Company and its subsidiaries : (Cont'd)

(iii) On 7 October 2019, ECSB was served by the solicitors of SSB with a Statement of Claim of the Defendant against the Third Party ("Third Party Proceeding"). (Cont'd)

The pleadings in respect of the Third Party Proceeding closed on 9 December 2019 and the matter was fixed for further case management on 16 July 2020.

On 19 December 2019, SSB filed an application under Order 14A and/or Order 33 rule 2 and/or rule 5 of the Rules of Court 2012 (“O. 14A Application”) for determination of six questions of law and for several consequential orders, including (a) that in the event the questions are determined in SSB's favour, the claim of GKCSB against SSB be struck out and/or dismissed, and (b) until the determination of the said questions, all proceedings in this matter be stayed. The case management for this O.14A Application was also fixed on 16 July 2020.

On 16 July 2020, the High Court directed for the O.14A Application to be heard first before the amendment application filed by the GKCSB, and that parties are to comply with the directions for submissions.

Upon having heard the parties on their submissions, the High Court had on 3 September 2021 dismissed the O. 14A Application with cost to GKCSB. On 27 September 2021, SSB filed a Notice of Appeal in respect of the O. 14A Application. SSB had also filed a Notice of Application together with the Affidavit in Support for a stay of proceedings application ("Stay Application") on 22 October 2021 and 25 October 2021 respectively. In addition, SSB had on 20 December 2021 filed a Notice of Application for the recusal of the present judge from hearing and deciding on the action, and that the action be heard and decided by a different high court judge ("Recusal Application"). The High Court ordered that in the interest of justice, the Recusal Application shall be heard first. Accordingly, the hearing of this Recusal Application is fixed on 22 March 2022.

Upon hearing parties on 22 March 2022, the Court dismissed the Recusal Application (Encl. 137) with no order as to costs. The Defendant further filed a Stay Application (Encl. 163) in respect of the Recusal Application (Encl. 137). On 25 April 2022, the Court fixed a ruling date on 11 May 2022 to rule whether to hear the Stay Application for Order 14 (Encl. 126) or Stay Application for Recusal (Encl. 163) first both filed by the Defendant. The Court vacated the ruling date on 11 May 2022 and further fixed the same on 17 June 2022. On 17 June 2022, the Court ordered that the Stay Application for Recusal (Encl. 163) should be heard first.

Upon hearing parties on 21 July 2022 and noted the appeals for both the O. 14A Application and Recusal Application on 28 September 2022, the Court allowed the Stay Application for Recusal (Encl. 163) with no order as to costs for the interest of justice. The Court further fixed a further mention on 30 September 2022 to monitor the case.

On 30 September 2022, as the instant matter has been stayed pending disposal of the appeals filed by the Defendant and the hearing date of the appeals has yet to be confirmed by the Court of Appeal, the Court fixed a mention via e-review on 29 November 2022 to update the court on the status of the appeals.

On 29 November 2022, the Plaintiff had informed the Court that the hearing date of the appeals filed by the Defendant has been fixed on 23 June 2023. In the circumstances, the Court further fixed a mention by way of e-review on 26 June 2023 for parties to update the status of the matter.

On 12 May 2023, the Plaintiff has filed a Notice of Discontinuance dated 12 May 2023 wherein the Plaintiff wholly discontinues the instant action with no liberty to file afresh and with no order as to costs and the Defendant wholly discontinues its counterclaim against the Plaintiff with no liberty to file afresh and with no order as to costs and the Defendant also wholly discontinues its Third Party Notice against the Third Party (ECSB) with no liberty to file afresh and with no order as to costs.

In the circumstances, the instant suit is discontinued by parties.

Resolution 7 seeks approval for the payment of Directors' Benefits up to an amount of RM200,000.00 with effect from the Thirty-Eighth Annual General Meeting until the next Annual General Meeting of the Company.

In the event where the Directors' Benefits payable exceeds the estimated amount sought in the Annual General Meeting, a shareholders' approval is to be sought in the next Annual General Meeting of the Company in 2024 on the payment of the exceeded amount.

# Resolution 8

The Audit and Risk Management Committee and the Board have considered the re-appointment of Mazars PLT ("Mazars") as Auditors of the Company and collectively agreed that Mazars has met the relevant criteria prescribed under Paragraph 15.21 of the Main Market Listing Requirements of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad.

# Resolution 9

The proposed resolution if passed, will empower the Directors of the Company to issue and allot shares of the Company from time to time and to grant rights to subscribe for shares in the Company, convert any securities into shares in the Company, or allot shares under an agreement or option or offer, provided that the aggregate number of shares allotted pursuant to this resolution does not exceed  $10\%$  of the total number of issued shares (excluding treasury shares) of the Company for the time being. The general mandate will provide flexibility to the Company for any possible fund raising activities.

As of the date of this notice, the Company had on 11 September 2023 issued 269,582,800 ordinary shares at an issue price of RM0.435 each in the Company pursuant to the mandate granted to the Directors at the AGM held on 9 December 2022.

Section 85(1) of the Companies Act 2016 ("the Act") states that subject to the Constitution of the Company, where a company issues shares which rank equally to existing shares as to voting or distribution rights, those shares shall first be offered to the holders of existing shares in a manner which would, if the offer were accepted, maintain the relative voting and distribution rights of those shareholders.

Clause 12(3)(a) of the Constitution of the Company states that subject to the Act, the Main Market Listing Requirements of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad and any direction to the contrary that may be given by the Company in General Meeting, all new shares or other convertible securities shall, before issue, be offered to such persons as at the date of the offer are entitled to receive notices from the Company of General Meetings in proportion as nearly as the circumstances admit, to the amount of the existing shares or securities to which they are entitled.

# Explanatory Notes to Special Business (Cont'd)

# Resolution 10

The Proposed Resolution 10, if passed, will enable the Group to enter into recurrent related party transactions of a revenue or trading nature which are necessary for the Group's day-to-day operations and are in the ordinary course of business made on at arm's length basis and on normal commercial terms which are not more favourable to the related parties than those generally available to the public and are not detrimental to the minority shareholders of the Company. This authority, unless revoked or varied at a general meeting, will expire at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company. Details of the Proposed Mandate are set out in the Circular to Shareholders dated 27 October 2023.

# Resolutions 11 and 12

The Proposed Resolutions 11 and 12, if passed, will enable Ms. Lim Ts-Fei and Mr. Lee Wai Kuen to continue to act as Independent Non-Executive Directors of the Company.

The Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance states that if the board intends to retain an independent director beyond nine (9) years, it should justify and seek annual shareholders' approval through a two-tier voting process.

The Nomination Committee has assessed the independence of Ms. Lim Ts-Fei and Mr. Lee Wai Kuen who have served as Independent Non-Executive Directors of the Company for a cumulative term of more than nine (9) years and recommended them to continue to act as Independent Non-Executive Directors of the Company based on the following justifications:

(a) Their expertise in corporate and legal matters had significantly contributed to the effectiveness of the Board and the Committees;  
(b) They have exercised their due care during their tenure as Independent Non-Executive Directors of the Company and they have carried out their professional duties in the interest of the Company and the shareholders; and
