# Accelerating Aotearoa through technology

Aotearoa New Zealand faces many interconnected challenges. The economic environment is tough, our productivity challenge is persistent, and climate change mitigation and adaptation is more urgent than ever before.

The good news is that the pace of technological advancement is accelerating just as quickly as these challenges.

Advanced digital technologies, such as generative AI, are changing the way people connect, communicate, and do business and have the potential to accelerate efficiency, productivity, and sustainability by enabling people and businesses to do things differently.

To bring these opportunities to our shores New Zealand will need investment in the digital infrastructure that underpins all forms of technology and connects us to the world, in innovation to unlock and scale new use cases, and in skilled people who can make it all a reality. And this is where Spark comes in.

As New Zealand's largest telecommunications and digital services provider, our ambition is to empower the people and businesses creating Aotearoa's tomorrow.

During FY24 we have continued to progress our three-year strategy, SPK-26, to achieve this goal. We are investing in the digital infrastructure that will underpin Aotearoa's digital economy and create long-term, sustainable growth for our shareholders.

We have continued to improve customer experiences by making it easier to interact with Spark, we are backing our business customers to leverage technology to its fullest potential, and we are investing in the skills and development of the people who make it all possible - our Spark whānau.

It has been a tough year for all New Zealand businesses, and Spark is not immune to these challenges. But we remain optimistic about our country's potential, the ingenuity of New Zealanders, and the role technology will play in enabling great people and businesses to do great things.

Ko te pae anamata whakamaua. Hello tomorrow.

# About this report

- This is an integrated report that shares our financial, social, environmental, and economic performance. To inform our approach we have applied the International <IR> Framework, which considers the creation of value over the short, medium, and long term, thinking holistically about the resources and relationships our organisation uses or affects and the dependencies and trade-offs between them as value is created.  
- At the heart of this approach is the <IR> value creation model (laid out on pages 6 and 7), which details the 'capitals' (the different resources and relationships that we rely on for our business activities) we draw upon, our strategy and business model, and the outputs and outcomes we deliver. We have a section of the report dedicated to each of these capitals. Our detailed financial report is covered in pages 106-155.  
- The report also applies the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards, the most widely used global sustainability reporting standard. This requires us to apply a materiality lens to identify and report against the sustainability issues most important to our business and our stakeholders. We have a dedicated sustainability appendix at the back of the report that includes our materiality matrix and GRI index, to direct readers to where we have covered specific sustainability topics in the report and elsewhere. See pages 163-174.  
- This report includes climate risk reporting, which has been prepared in compliance with the Aotearoa New Zealand Climate Standards (NZ CS 1, NZ CS 2 and NZ CS 3) issued by the External Reporting Board (XRB). See pages 90-105.  
- This Annual Report is published alongside a suite of other disclosures covering the FY24 period, including our Corporate Governance Statement, our Modern Slavery and Human Rights Statement, and our Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report.

# How we create value

As part of Integrated Reporting, we use this diagram to show how we create value as a business. It starts with the forms of capital we rely on - from traditional forms of capital, such as financial capital, to broader forms of capital, such as manufactured or human capital. It then displays the outputs we have delivered as a result in FY24, alongside the longer-term outcomes we are trying to achieve.

# Chair and CEO review

# Tena koutou,

It has been a challenging year for Spark and for many businesses across Aotearoa, with recessionary economic conditions creating a tough operating environment.

Public sector spending cuts and deferred private sector investment had a significant impact on IT services revenues, while lower consumer and business confidence impacted sales of mobile devices and accessories and intensified competitive pricing pressure, particularly in business mobile.

We did see strong growth in many of our core markets such as mobile, where service revenue surpassed $1 billion for the first time, as well as cloud, data centres, and high-tech.

This was not enough to offset subdued demand in other areas, and we could not adapt our cost base quickly enough as the market turned. This resulted in the lowering of FY24 EBITDAI guidance in May and an overall FY24 performance below our ambitions.

Because our FY24 financial results are cycling the significant revenue and net profit declared in FY23 following the

TowerCo and Spark Sport transactions, we have provided both reported and adjusted year-on-year comparisons - the latter of which strips out the impact of the one-off gain to provide a like-for-like performance comparison.

FY24 EBITDAI of $1,163 million was down 2.5% on an adjusted basis and 32.5% on a reported basis.

Reported NPAT declined 72.2% to  $316 million as a result of cycling the TowerCo and Spark Sport transactions, lower EBITDAI, higher finance expenses and depreciation, and a one-off$ 26 million non-cash tax adjustment relating to recent Government policy changes. Adjusted NPAT, excluding this one-off item, declined 21% to $342 million.

Lower EBITDAI and higher interest, lease costs, and non-cash earnings impacted free cash flow, which reduced \(32.5\%\) to \\(330 million.

While we are disappointed to not achieve our FY24 performance ambitions, as we look to the year ahead, our business fundamentals are strong, and we continue to see opportunities for growth.

![](images/370be88f31c239eaa5fddce429082535307abf6ef4d2f71a2a4e9029690f1dcd.jpg)  
Justine Smyth CNZM, Chair and Jolie Hodson MNZM, CEO.

Our leadership in the growing mobile market will support top-line growth as demand for data continues to grow, customer experience remains strong, and annual price reviews enable us to realise the value of the significant investments we make into our network every year.

Through our SPK-26 Operate Programme we made changes to our operating model during FY24, to align our teams to our new strategy and our labour costs to changing revenue trends, with the majority of these benefits to be realised in FY25.

This work will continue to deliver further labour and opex cost reductions, improve margins, and insulate Spark from the economic environment. This includes a material change to our Enterprise and Government division, where we will integrate our subsidiaries into Spark to remove duplication, simplify our product portfolios and processes, and deliver better customer experiences with greater efficiency.

It is never easy to make changes that impact our people, and we do not do so lightly. However, to compete in a challenging economic environment we must make the difficult but necessary decisions to ensure our cost base is sustainable. We will continue to provide our teams with the appropriate support to transition through these changes.

Our data centre strategy is a significant mid-term growth opportunity. The New Zealand data centre market is predicted to grow from  $\sim 90\mathrm{MW}$  today to  $\sim 500\mathrm{MW}$  by 2030, driven by the acceleration of AI, and in particular Generative AI, and ongoing business migration to the cloud.

With Spark's potential development pipeline now sitting at 118MW, and three strategic Auckland locations primed for investment, we are well positioned to capture a significant share of this growth and maintain our competitive position in the market.

The reinstatement of our Dividend Reinvestment Plan for the H2 FY24 dividend and a potential hybrid capital notes issuance will help fund our growth investments in the near term, and we will also explore other equity funding options such as capital partnerships.

We remain committed to maintaining financial strength and flexibility and our investment grade credit rating, and the Board is pleased to confirm a total FY24 dividend of 27.5 cents per share for our shareholders,  $100\%$  imputed.

# Our FY24 Market Performance

As topline growth was impacted by economic conditions and intensified competition, FY24 revenue of \(3,861 million declined 1.2% on an adjusted basis and 14% on a reported basis.

Mobile service revenue increased  $3.1\%$  to $1,010 million, driven by consumer connection growth, price increases, and stabilised roaming revenues, and partially offset by declines in the business market as price competition intensified. We were pleased to maintain our #1 position in mobile market share by service revenue and total connections.

Broadband revenue declined \(2.1\%\) to \\(613 million, as lower consumer spending increased price-driven competition, particularly amongst non-telco competitors.

As we continued to invest in digitisation and service innovation, we were pleased to see our measure of customer satisfaction (our interaction net promoter score) increase by 7 points to +38.

In our digital services market, total IT revenue declined \(1.6\%\) to \(692 million. This was driven by a \(14.9\%\) decrease in IT services revenue as economic conditions impacted demand and masked \(3.5\%\) growth in IT products, which was driven by continued strong growth in cloud as businesses digitise.

Data centres revenue grew  $54.2\%$  to \ $37 million, as our Takanini campus expansion was completed on time and on budget, and new revenue streams came online. Our high-tech revenue grew \(21.5\%$  to \\)79 million, with Internet of Things (IoT) revenues up  $53.3\%$  and over 2 million devices now connected to our IoT networks.

# Our FY24 Toitū Sustainability Performance

Every year we make significant investments into the digital infrastructure that underpins New Zealand's economy, supports businesses both big and small to grow, and unlocks new commercialisation opportunities for Spark. In FY24 over $350 million was invested in our highly secure and resilient network and digital infrastructure, delivering a 28% increase in mobile network capacity and underpinning growth in data centres, IoT, and high-tech.

We understand how important connectivity is to the lives of all New Zealanders, and we continued to expand the reach of our 5G network, increase rural connectivity, and support more equitable access to the digital world. We now support 31,776 households in need across the country through our not-for-profit broadband service Skinny Jump.

Our scope 1 and 2 emissions increased  $26.7\%$  in FY24, largely driven by a one-off event at an exchange, when the release of fire suppressant was triggered by an alarm. Unfortunately, this means we are tracking  $18.6\%$  above the pathway required to reach our Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) target. Without this event we would be tracking  $5.7\%$  above our pathway, as a result of the higher emissions factor of the New Zealand grid during the year.

We did, however, make strong progress on future emissions reductions when we signed a ten-year renewable energy Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Genesis in May.

In exploring renewable energy partnership opportunities, it was important to us to support investment in new renewable energy - rather than buying certificates for existing renewables that were added to the grid many years ago. This new partnership supported this ambition and will see us purchase all of the electricity generated by Genesis' first solar farm in Lauriston Canterbury. The 63MW site will meet around  $60\%$  of our current annual requirements once it becomes operational in 2025 and will make a significant contribution towards our scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction target in the years ahead.

During the year we also continued to invest in the development and wellbeing of our

people. We launched a new internal skilling centre, Te Awe, to upskill and reskill our people in new and emerging technologies, and enhanced our Mahi Tahi wellbeing programme with a new partnership with Clearhead, which gives our people access to six fully funded therapy sessions annually. Over 1,500 people have used the service so far, and in our most recent culture survey,  $88\%$  of our people said they believe their wellbeing is supported by their leaders at Spark.

# Operating revenues and other gains

- Mobile revenue increased  $4 million, or \(0.3\%$ , with mobile service revenue surpassing \)1 billion for the first time, growing $30 million, or  $3.1\%$ . This was driven by connections growth, price increases in the consumer market, and increased roaming and was partly offset by price pressure in the government and enterprise sector. Non-service revenue declined $26 million, or  $5.3\%$ , due to lower volumes of handset and accessories sales as consumers delayed spending on new devices.  
- Broadband revenue declined \(13 million, or 2.1% due to a decline in total broadband connection numbers of 12,000, or \(1.7\%\), as competitor activity persisted, and lower average revenue per user (ARPU) as customers migrated off legacy plans.  
- IT revenue declined  $11 million, or \(1.6\%$ . Within this, cloud revenue grew \)16 million, or  $7.7\%$ , due to onboarding of new private cloud clients and increased public cloud uptake, but was more than offset by a $29 million, or  $14.9\%$ , decline in IT services revenue due to price pressure on re-signing of existing customers and a decline in project activity across the government and enterprise sector.  
- Procurement and partners revenue decreased \(36 million, or \(6.2\%\), mainly due to lower procurement volumes across the customer base, noting this was substantially offset by associated lower procurement costs.  
Voice revenues declined  $51 million, or 22.1\%$  due to connection losses and associated lower calling volumes as part of a continued shift from fixed line to wireless calling. Legacy voice revenues now contribute less than  $5\%$  of total revenue.  
- Data centre revenue increased $13 million, or 54.2%, as increased capacity became available following the completion of the second data centre pod at Takanini.  
- High-tech revenue increased $14 million, or 21.5%, driven by strong IoT connections and revenue growth and continued growth in MATTR, partly offset by a slight decline in Qrious following the completion of a number of large customer projects.

- Other operating revenue declined \(36 million, or 20.9%, primarily driven by the closure of the Spark Sport platform at the end of FY23.  
- Other gains increased  $69 million to$ 102 million due to the sale of mobile network equipment, gains on lease modifications and terminations, and vendor investments into Spark's network in support of revenue growth opportunities.  
- Excluded from the prior year adjusted result is the net gain of $583 million from the sale of Connexa (formerly 'TowerCo'), which contained Spark's passive mobile tower assets.

1 Earnings before finance income and expense, income tax, depreciation, amortisation, and net investment income (EBITDAI) and capital expenditure are non-Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (non-GAAP) measures. These measures are defined and reconciled in note 2.5 of the financial statements.  
2 The prior year is adjusted for the impact of the net gain on sale of Connexa of  $583 million, within other gains, and the one-off provision of$ 54 million for Spark Sport, within operating expenses. There were no adjusting items impacting EBITDAI in FY24.

# Operating expenses

- Product costs decreased \(53 million, or \(2.9\%\), with declines broadly in line with decreases in associated revenues. This included lower procurement volumes, reduced voice connections, and the exit of Spark Sport and were partly offset by increases in cloud, IoT, and MATTR in line with revenue growth.  
Labour costs were stable year-on-year with growth in Entellar Group and increased remuneration costs being offset by targeted reductions across the business in line with operating model changes.  
- Other operating expenses increased \(35 million, or \(8.7\%\), driven by a full year of charges under the Connexa lease arrangement, bad debt costs, and severance costs.  
- Excluded from the prior year adjusted result was a $54 million provision resulting from the closure of the Spark Sport business.

# Other

- Total depreciation and amortisation increased \(23 million, or 4.6%, largely driven by higher costs associated with the increased capital spend across FY23 and FY24, combined with increased depreciation on right-of-use assets.  
- Net finance expense increased \(47 million, driven by higher costs associated with both increased interest rates and higher debt levels, as well as increased interest on leases due to a full year of Connexa leases and long-term infrastructure leases.  
- Adjusted tax expense decreased \(13 million, largely due to decreased adjusted earnings before tax for the period.  
- The  $26 million non-cash tax adjustment in FY24 relates to the introduction of Government policy changes to remove the tax depreciation deduction on buildings, with a corresponding reduction in the associated deferred tax asset. In FY23 the tax income on the adjusting items includes$ 14 million for the Spark Sport provision and $154 million as a result of the Connexa transaction.

3 FY24 net earnings is adjusted for the impact of the zero-rating of tax depreciation on buildings, which has resulted in a  $26 million non-cash increase in tax expense and corresponding reduction in the deferred tax asset. FY23 is adjusted for the impact of the net gain on sale of Connexa of$ 583 million, the one-off provision of $54 million for Spark Sport, the $5 million net gain on dilution of the investment in the Connexa group, and related tax impacts of $168 million.

- Operating cash flows decreased $36 million due to higher payments for interest on debt. Lower receipts from customers resulting from lower revenues were substantially offset by a similar reduction in payments to suppliers.  
- Investing cash outflows of  $550 million in FY24 were mainly due to payments for the purchase of property, plant and equipment and intangibles. While in FY23, this was an inflow of$ 425 million, mainly due to the receipt of net proceeds from the sale of the Connexa business of $893 million, partially offset by payments for the purchase of property, plant and equipment and intangibles of $475 million.  
Financing cash outflows were  $255 million in FY24 compared with an outflow of$ 1,196 million in FY23. The prior year included repayments of debt of $463 million following the sale of Connexa. In FY24 debt levels increased as funds were invested in capital projects in line with Spark's strategy and the on-market share buy-back concluded.  
- Free cash flow of  $330 million was$ 159 million lower in FY24, driven by the decline in EBITDAI, increased cash payments for capital expenditure included in free cash flow $^{1}$ , and increased interest payments.

# Capital expenditure<sup>2</sup>

# $518m

Capital expenditure in FY24 included the following key focus areas and projects:

- Investment to support cloud, security, and service management revenue growth, including an uplift in software licensing to support Spark's private cloud.  
- Fixed network and international cable capacity to meet future requirements for Spark's fibre and transport network, continuation of our core network expansion and resilience programme, advancement of our exit strategy for the PSTN, and international cable capacity purchases to meet forecasted demand for data. This includes enablement investment for Multi-Access Edge Compute (MAEC).  
- Lifecycle investment and licensing for internal IT systems, enhancements to support new products and deliver simple, intuitive customer experiences, expansion of enterprise systems capability, and investment in deep customer insights, automation, and artificial intelligence. This includes the development of foundational capability to support converged technology solutions.  
- Continued investment in Spark's mobile core and radio access network (RAN) delivering greater network capacity and coverage. FY24 includes an uplift in Spark's 5G investment to accelerate our rollout of this technology and provide a full 5G standalone capability as an enabler of future revenues from emerging technologies.  
- Completion of data centre capacity upgrades at the Takanini and Aotea Campuses in Auckland. Commencement of next stage of Takanini development, planned North Shore campus, and upgrades to the Waikato data centre.  
- Property investment in Spark's corporate offices, retail stores fitouts and refits, and sustain investment for power and building services for Spark-owned exchanges and data centres.

Cash payments for capital expenditure items (including capitalised interest and excluding spectrum payments) in the statement of cash flows were  $592 million compared with capital expenditure of$ 518 million. The main drivers of this difference are related to network expenditure items that were received in FY23 but not paid for until FY24, together with payments of capex at the end of FY24 in relation to long term network projects that have not yet been implemented.

2 Capital expenditure is a non-GAAP measure and is defined in note 2.5 of the financial statements.  
3 Capital expenditure to operating revenues for FY23 is calculated on adjusted operating revenue (excluding the gain on Connexa sale) to enable a meaningful comparison.

# Strategic role of the Board

Spark's Board plays a critical role in helping to guide and test company strategy, by engaging in an ongoing conversation with the Leadership Squad around key strategic decisions. These decisions are in relation to the long-term strategic planning and direction of the business and our ability to create value in the medium and long term. It also includes non-financial performance in areas such as customer experience, governance, and sustainability. The Board approves and monitors SPK-26 (our business strategy) and has oversight of cyber security and maturity, modern slavery, and climate change risk. For a detailed explanation of the Board's oversight of climate risk and opportunities see page 91.

As the body elected by shareholders to protect and enhance the value of Spark's assets, the Board has oversight of Spark's financials and the annual and three-year planning processes. Board members engage in robust discussions with management around the strategic direction of the business to test and ensure investment is going towards the things that will deliver the best outcomes for the company and shareholders. This flows through to Spark's remuneration policies, where there is Board involvement in setting targets and hurdles for short-term and long-term incentives.

# Company Secretary

The Company Secretary is responsible for supporting the effectiveness of the Board by ensuring that its policies and procedures are followed and for coordinating the completion and dispatch of the Board agendas and papers. The Company Secretary is a position distinct from the Leadership Squad and is accountable to the Board, via the Chair, on all governance matters, as further described in the Board Charter.

# Board renewal and succession

Spark's Board has an appropriate mix of tenure, skills, diversity, and experience. The Board skills matrix on page 21 outlines the qualifications, capabilities, geographic location, tenure, and gender of each member of the Board. Ethnicity information is available on page 72 of this report.

There is an ongoing Board succession programme, which is focussed on finding new directors with relevant skills and experience that complement the diverse perspectives already represented around the table. During FY24, as part of the Board's ongoing succession planning, Lisa Nelson joined the Board as an independent Non-executive Director, effective May 2024, and Charles Sitch resigned as an independent Non-executive Director with effect from 3 November 2023. We wish to thank Charles for his huge contribution to the Board over his twelve-year tenure.

# OUTCOMES

# Connected customers

As New Zealand's largest telecommunications and digital services company, we have relevance for almost every New Zealander. Our customers range from individual New Zealanders and households, to small businesses, not-for-profits, government, and large enterprise customers, delivering mobile, broadband, cloud, and digital services.

We are excited by the opportunities digitisation brings and recognise our responsibility to help Aotearoa leverage new capabilities to become more productive and sustainable through technology.

The Made For You Review campaign.

# Customer experience

We have an enduring focus on improving the experiences of Spark customers, by making their interactions with us simple and effective. This work is showing up in customer feedback, with our measure of customer satisfaction, our interaction net promoter score (iNPS) up 7 points to +38 in FY24.

# A simple, data driven organisation

A core pillar of our strategy is to create a simple, data driven organisation, which will underpin our ability to improve customer experiences, drive efficiency, and support future growth.

In October, we completed our Plan Simplification Programme, where we moved customers from legacy broadband plans to newer plans that are more suited to customer needs. As part of this, we migrated over 73,400 customers from legacy fibre plans to new fibre plans, moved over 71,200 customers off our Unplan wireless plans to more fit-for-purpose wireless plans, and shifted over 10,900 mobile lines to current plans.

# Using data and AI to improve transparency

Integrating a data driven approach throughout our business has allowed our teams to more effectively identify customer pain points and address the root causes. In FY24, we launched our 'emerging trends' tool - an AI-generated report that identifies monthly changes to customer experience. As an example, this report identified that customers were unhappy with our care team messaging service, particularly when they were passed from agent to agent. In response, the care team was able to make changes to limit the number of messages each agent could handle, which reversed the negative trend.

During the year, we also integrated new technology into Spark's wireless broadband modems. This means we can now accurately measure speeds that our customers receive on our 4G and 5G wireless broadband plans, and share this information as an average on our website and in our marketing materials. As a result, our customers are better equipped with the information they need to understand the speeds they can expect when signing up for a wireless broadband plan with Spark.

# CONSUMER AND SMALL BUSINESS INPS

# Up 7 points

to  $+38$  in FY24.

We also continued to optimise our right planning programme Made For You Review, which harnesses the power of AI to analyse a customer's data, messaging, and calling usage, and then recommends the best and most cost-effective plan for them based on their activity. Spark's customer care teams underwent a major training programme in FY24 to equip them to understand the data served up by Made For You Review, so they can have better conversations with customers and guide them towards the right plan for their needs.

When utilising any of our data and AI capabilities, we are guided by our AI Principles, Generative AI Policy, Privacy Values, and Privacy Policy, which ensure we take a responsible and ethical approach to the design and operation of AI technologies. Our AI Principles are published on our website, providing transparency for all our stakeholders: www.spark.co.nz/online/about/ourcompany/governance. See page 34 for further details on our AI Governance and privacy values.

# Bringing New Zealanders the best digital-first experiences

In the last year we have continued to focus on digital-first care experiences for our customers, to better anticipate customer needs, reduce wait times, and improve the overall experience of interacting with Spark.

Our retail and virtual care agents form our United Frontline (UFL) and support our customers across a variety of channels - including call centres, stores, and through digital messaging. Enabling our team to flow across channels ensures our customers receive timely responses and an experience that consistently 'feels like Spark'. This year we saw use of our messaging tool, which is available via the MySpark App or a customer's preferred messaging app, surpass voice calling as the preferred customer contact method for the first time.

Our UFL teams are now utilising the same online journey as our customers, rather than navigating more complex, separate systems. This means Spark agents can see exactly what our customers can see when providing support, which is enabling faster and more effective resolution.

As part of our digital first approach to service, this year we introduced Outage Assist, which has significantly improved the service experience for customers experiencing fixed broadband outages. With Outage Assist, we can now proactively notify customers of an issue on their fixed broadband line and provide them with a unique fault tracking link, as well as

"This year we saw use of our messaging tool surpass voice calling as the preferred customer contact method for the first time."

![](images/1c1bf00a6b55f529dad3d3c4a331ea15ff36d373bc4c261c104076bf6d31c905.jpg)

unlimited calls, texts, and mobile data if they have a pay monthly mobile on the same account. This allows customers to track the resolution of the fault without having to call Spark and keeps them connected with extra mobile data. Customers can also troubleshoot and diagnose household speed issues at any time using the Spark Connection Check tool within the MySpark app. Since introducing Outage Assist, we saw a  $35\%$  decrease in our inbound broadband call volume when compared to the same period in FY23.

To further enhance speed of resolution we introduced help videos as a new section in the MySpark app during the year. Initially targeting high volume query types, customers can be linked to these videos from web, phone, and messaging interactions before speaking with a Spark agent.

We also introduced a multi-channel e-commerce experience using the MySpark app and website, which has driven a  $26\%$  increase in website and app revenue growth collectively.

# Introducing Hello Tomorrow

In September we launched our new brand positioning, 'Hello Tomorrow', which will underpin our brand building efforts in the years ahead. Hello Tomorrow represents our belief that technology creates opportunities, and when you feel you have an opportunity today, it changes how you see tomorrow.

We launched the new positioning with a TV campaign, which was shot from the point of view of a piece of technology. This technology narrates the commercial and shares that while it is capable of many things, it doesn't know what it feels like to take a chance, like people do every day. This brings to life our belief that technology's role is to enable people to do great things.

# Bringing New Zealanders the entertainment that moves them

# Spark Open Audition

In October we launched 'Spark Open Audition' - a nationwide search for Aotearoa's next emerging musician who would receive $10,000 worth of prizes, including studio time at BIG FAN recording studio to help launch their career into the music industry. We encouraged applicants to enter by posting a 'duet' with a video of homegrown rapper JessB on TikTok. 18-year-old Dunedin local, Niamh Crooks, was voted by Aotearoa as the winner, with her original song, 'Devotion' striking a chord with New Zealanders. The campaign generated over 17 million views, with #SparkOpenAudition trending number two on TikTok.

# Spark Game Arena

We launched Spark Game Arena during FY24 with a nationwide online tournament, 'The Rise Cup featuring Fortnite'. Delivered in partnership with leading esports organiser LetsPlay.Live, over 1,200 tournament participants competed over three weekends for the chance to win a share of $30,000.

Our ambition is for Spark Game Arena to become the home of gaming at Spark through partnerships with leading brands, industry partners, and events. Spark Game Arena aims to offer exciting new gaming products and experiences, while maintaining a commitment to safe, inclusive, and equitable experiences, which is underscored by partnerships with Netsafe and Spark Foundation partner, Digital Natives Academy.

# Noise Control

In partnership with Spotify, we launched Noise Control in August - a first of its kind music show. Hosted by DJ duo The Katayanagi Twins, Noise Control presented 10 live music events in Auckland, offering Spark customers exclusive access to intimate performances and Q&A sessions with top local artists. Featuring musicians like Riiki Reid, Troy Kingi, Muroki, and There's a Tuesday, Noise Control put a spotlight on emerging kiwi talent and provided our customers with an unforgettable experience.

# Empowering the businesses creating Aotearoa's tomorrow

Spark is a trusted partner to New Zealand's business community, supporting businesses of all sizes to harness the power of technology to become more productive and sustainable.

# Supporting the growth of small-medium businesses

Spark supports over 110,000 small to medium businesses (SMEs) around New Zealand through our network of 24 local Business Hubs. Each Business Hub is locally owned through our licensee model, meaning they have a deep understanding of the needs of their local customers. Customers are responding positively to this 'local like you' model, with our SME customer satisfaction score up +8 points in FY24 to +48.

Our SME customers are feeling the pressures of a tough economic environment, with their number one concern being escalating costs. With this in mind, our focus is on enabling SMEs to use technology to become more productive - so they can do more, with less. In FY24, we launched our 'right-sized solutions' campaign, which supports our SME customers with plans and technology that meet their individual needs.

In FY24, we also continued our partnership with the Government's Digital Boost programme, which equips small business owners with the practical skills needed to get their businesses online. More than 69,000 SME users have engaged with the platform to date. Our Director of Consumer and SME, Greg Clark, sits on the Digital Boost Alliance's Board of Governance. Spark also provided the connectivity and IT solutions for Digital Boost's Tech Boost service, that is helping businesses access fit-for-purpose IT gear and tools, which launched in June.

# Spark Business Lab

Spark Business Lab educates and engages SME businesses through events, educational content, and hands-on digital workshops across the country. In FY24, Spark Business Lab delivered two events in its Future State series, presented in collaboration with Semi Permanent.

In November, global sustainability leaders in food, fashion, and design travelled to Wellington to present 'Future State 002: The Turning Point', which focussed on how businesses can embrace circularity in their own supply chains. In May, an audience of 700 gathered at Spark Arena for 'Future State 003: Ahead of the Curve', where leaders from organisations such as Nike, Accenture, and NYU Stern Business School explored the driving forces behind their digital transformation.

# Supporting kaupapa Māori

Spark's business customers include a variety of Māori businesses across the country.

In FY24, we partnered with the Media Design School to offer students an opportunity to respond to a real client brief, like one they might encounter in the industry. The students were challenged to design a campaign to help Spark celebrate Matariki and encourage rangatahi to explore careers in technology.

The selected concept was called 'Matariki Hunga Nui' and presented an augmented reality experience that aimed to bring people together under the stars of Matariki. In this concept, augmented reality offered users an immersive experience that guided them in learning how to use Te Waka o Rangi - the celestial navigation tool - to locate Ngā Whetu o Matariki.

Matariki Hunga Nui was awarded silver in the Student & Academic Toitanga at the Designers Institute of New Zealand Best Design Awards.

During the year we supported our partner Te Pūtahitanga o Te Waipounamu, an organisation that seeks to create social impact by investing directly in initiatives developed by whānau or community groups.

This involved hosting Te Pūṭahitanga o Te Waipounamu at Te Tihi Health conference in Hamilton, taking them for a tour of our Innovation Studio and offering them a place on our Al for Business Mini MBA, alongside other Māori business partners.

# Spark Business Group

Spark Business Group continued to support New Zealand's largest businesses and government ministries to harness the power of technology for productivity and growth, with some notable examples outlined below.

As businesses continue to migrate their operations to the cloud, in FY24 Spark's cloud business, CCL, launched CloudIQ - a managed hybrid cloud service designed to help businesses seamlessly manage their diverse cloud platforms, including on-premise, private, and public clouds. CloudIQ leverages CCL's local data centres, as well as partnerships with major global cloud providers, to provide flexible cloud solutions designed to meet businesses' needs today and to prepare them for the future.

During FY24, Spark also introduced ServiceFlex, a modular IT service management solution that combines smart

technology, automation, and AI to enhance IT service delivery. ServiceFlex provides features such as IT service desk solutions, proactive insights, and interactive key performance indicator (KPI) measures, and is designed to streamline IT operations, improve user experience, and reduce costs through automated processes. ServiceFlex is aimed at corporates, enterprises, and government organisations, and was launched with New Zealand Red Cross and Fidelity Life as foundation customers.

In March, Spark's data and AI business Qrious celebrated a decade of pioneering data and AI innovation in New Zealand. Qrious has implemented transformative technological solutions across a variety of sectors. For example, Qrious is helping the world's largest marketer of kiwifruit, Zespri, to unlock its data to get the highest quality fruit possible onto consumers' plates, and developing an AI-powered disease detection system with Ingenum.

# Harnessing the power of AI to combat disease outbreaks in livestock

A mass disease outbreak could have a devastating effect on livestock, the farming community, and New Zealand's economy. Concerned by this, veterinary startup, Ingenum wanted to develop an early warning system to detect notifiable diseases in livestock and enable a timely biosecurity response.

With the knowledge that tell-tale signs of disease may be hidden within the plethora of on-farm data being captured every day around the country, Ingenum, partnered with Qrious to develop an AI solution. The team developed Sentinel-AI - a bespoke AI system that integrates inputs from multiple sources, including government agencies, veterinary practices, on-farm technology and abattoirs and analyses the incoming data in real time, while respecting the privacy of its sources. In the process it develops a 'picture' of typical patterns of livestock health, which allows it to detect and flag any anomalies that may be indicative of disease.

This real-time data tracking will enable all stakeholders, including disease response teams, to get ahead of the curve and make better informed decisions to protect Aotearoa's biosecurity and farming industry.

# Accelerating Aotearoa businesses one technology generation forward

In February, Spark and the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research (NZIER) launched a new report titled 'Accelerating Aotearoa businesses one technology generation forward' - examining the state of New Zealand's productivity challenge, and the role advanced digital technologies can play in solving it.

The study combined insights from global research into small advanced economies, economic modelling by NZIER, and Spark's knowledge of current and future opportunities enabled by digital technology. It revealed that a  $20\%$  uplift in the use of advanced digital technologies is predicted to increase industry output by up to $26 billion over the next decade and GDP by as much as  $2.08\%$  per year.

# Innovation in action

To launch these findings, we brought our business customers, industry experts, and media together to witness innovation in action. Across seven life-size showcases, technology experts demonstrated the productivity benefits to be gained through the implementation of advanced digital technologies.

Audiences saw how the use of AI reduces the time it takes to assess damage on New Zealand roads, down from 66 days to just seven, how extended reality headsets

business and government customers, with  $12 million allocated to customers already, and an additional$ 3 million will be available for customers to apply for over three years.

# AI for Business Mini MBA

As part of the research, NZIER asked businesses about their knowledge gaps when it comes to advanced digital technologies - with  $44\%$  of respondents stating they did not have enough information about AI to make use of it in their businesses. This inspired Spark to launch New Zealand's first AI for Business Mini MBA programme.

In May, 150 business leaders from a variety of sectors embarked on a four-week intensive programme to build their competitive edge with Al. The programme was offered exclusively to Spark business customers and presented in collaboration with Section, a world-leading business education platform based in North America. The course was designed to help participants design Al strategies fit for their businesses.  $100\%$  of participants surveyed said they will apply the learnings within their business and  $78\%$  said they would consider using Spark to help implement an Al solution for their business.

# Mini MBA turbo charges Al journey for Te Putahitanga o Te Wai Pounamu

Te Pūtahitanga o Te Waipounamu is a social impact investment agency working on behalf of eight Te Waipounamu iwi to determine solutions to support whānau development. Martin Conway, Toki Kaupapa Matua (Projects Specialist), says his employer is motivated by the potential productivity gains offered by Al, allowing kaimahi (employees) more time for engagement with whānau, supporting their commissioned initiatives, and communities they serve.

For his final report in the AI for Business Mini MBA course, Martin presented an AI use case that aims to streamline the funding application process by an additional  $20\%$ .

Martin says that once Te Putahitanga o Te Waipounamu's policy and procedures protecting data sovereignty, and outlining AI governance, are in place, this will be a starting point for the use of Al into other workstreams. While Al will complement the expertise and talent within their workforce, he is keen to emphasise the point that whanau voice is at the heart of all that they do, which is something that cannot be replaced by Al.

# Spark Health

Spark Health continued to provide digital services, including software and IT services, to Te Whatu Ora (Health New Zealand).

As a result of the macroeconomic environment and a slow down in Government spending, in FY24 Spark Health refreshed its growth strategy with a greater emphasis on the private sector, including primary and community healthcare providers. Here it aims to support customers with digital transformation and emerging technologies such as data, cloud, and AI. As part of this new focus on the private sector, Spark Health added two experienced clinicians as Digital Clinician Leads to the team - Professor Matthew Parson, Clinical Chair of Gerontology, and Dr Karl Cole, a General Practitioner.

# Spark Wholesale

Spark Wholesale supports New Zealand and international service providers with Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) services, data transport, national backhaul, international connectivity, cloud, internet, IP voice, and satellite services.

In the past year, our wholesale business continued to grow by supporting local and global providers, including Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and cloud platform partners, with their data growth needs. This included providing global cloud providers with higher rate, wholesale international capacity services, including 100Gbps and 400Gbps bandwidths, on Southern Cross and TGA submarine cable paths out of New Zealand and strong growth in the 'application to person messaging' SMS (A2P One) service, which supports global communication platform providers with their messaging solutions to New Zealanders.

Spark was recognised on the international stage in January 2024 at the Pacific Telecommunications Council Awards, where we received the 'Outstanding Carrier Solutions Provider' award for investments into our national optical transport network and its self-healing capabilities, which provides resilient connectivity between New Zealand's major cities.

# MATTR

MATTR operates in a new market of Trust Technology - or what we call TrustTech for short.

The TrustTech market is focussed on addressing the challenges governments, businesses, and individuals all face in the digital world, where trust is difficult to establish and hard to maintain. It is an umbrella term for platform capabilities that enable end-to-end trust lifecycle management, for example digital identity credentials.

During the year MATTR expanded its operations in Australia and North America, with business development talent in place across both markets.

In Australia, MATTR continues to work as the technology provider to the NSW Government's Digital ID and Verifiable Credentials programme and in July announced a new partnership with Austroads, a member-owned collective comprising the transport authorities of Australia and New Zealand.

Austroads is creating a National Digital Trust Service (DTS), which will provide critical digital infrastructure to support Australian jurisdictions in delivering Mobile Drivers Licences (mDL). MATTR will be working closely with Austroads to power the first stage of the project, a pre-production version of the DTS, based on the MATTR VII platform.

# Keeping our customers safe online

Spark puts cyber security, customer safety, and privacy at the forefront of everything we do. We invest in the security of our own networks and also support our business customers with their security needs.

We offer customers a breadth of capability to monitor and detect attacks across their networks and information architecture, reduce business security risk, and improve their security profiles.

# Cyber security

The World Economic Forum's Global Cyber security Outlook Report 2024 identified a stark divide between cyber-resilient organisations and those that are struggling. The report predicts that emerging technologies will exacerbate challenges related to cyber resilience, especially for those that are less capable.

In New Zealand, Spark is a trusted advisor to businesses on cyber security and works alongside cyber security agencies and partners, to monitor and respond to threats.

Our Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) has responsibility for Spark's cyber security, while the Audit and Risk Management Committee of Spark's Board has governance responsibility.

We govern our security programme using the industry's best practice frameworks, including ISO27001 and NIST CSF (National Institute of Standards and Technology Cyber Security Framework). All Spark services and networks are built with multiple checks in place during the 'design', 'build', and 'operate' phases, to ensure they are deployed with industry leading levels of security, and we continually assess and measure our cyber security maturity level.

![](images/5f1ce289f6f463c52198d0257ed79f841e66df3eb21df880d063f81d4b5aaa3e.jpg)  
The Cyber Defence Tribe at the 2023 New Zealand Women in Security Awards.

Our cyber security strategy is shaped with the following inputs:

- Dynamic road mapping: we adopt a dynamic three-year outlook on our security posture in an effort to predict and prepare for potential cyber threats in the coming years, whilst remaining flexible to the realities of threats as they arise. Roadmap management allows our team to scrutinise our cyber security strategy on a quarterly basis, considering evolving global cyber security threats and any new technologies we can implement to enable and protect our business, people, and customers.

- Maturity assessments: our goal is to always be aligned with, or even exceed, the latest industry standards to consistently elevate our cyber security maturity. We audit our security maturity through internal and external audits, with frameworks like NIST, SOC-CMM, and a proprietary CMMI Maturity model developed by Accenture forming the backbone of these assessments. In FY24 we partnered with Google's Mandiant to undertake a comprehensive maturity assessment, which will enable us to continue to evolve and uplift our maturity even further.

- Alignment with Spark's business strategy: our cyber security strategy is carefully aligned to both our wider business strategy and the network evolution strategy, to ensure it can support our business objectives.

Spark people also play a critical role in helping to detect and defend against potential cyber security threats. For that reason, all our people are required to undertake regular cyber security training, to equip them in identifying and helping to mitigate potential threats.

We have a large cyber security team with over 150 security subject matter experts and processes that ensure appropriate ownership, oversight, and ongoing risk management is applied to our customers' and Spark's IT systems and data. Our Incident Response Plan governs how we respond to threats, and we have invested heavily in our threat intelligence platform.

In August, Spark entered into a partnership with leading global cyber security provider, Radware, to resell its suite of security solutions to enterprise customers. As part of this partnership, we have also integrated Radware's Cloud DDoS Protection Service into our existing IT infrastructure as an added layer of protection against complex DDoS attacks - where multiple 'bots' are used to send massive amounts of internet traffic to a website server, causing it to become overloaded and unable to handle legitimate user requests.

In November, Spark's Cyber Defence Tribe won the award for Best Place to Work at the 2023 New Zealand Women in Security Awards.

# Online safety

We recognise the important role we must play in protecting our customers from the growing list of threats they face online - including scams, cyber security risks, and objectionable material.

# Scams

Spark has an important role to play in helping prevent our customers falling victim to increasingly frequent and sophisticated scams. Because we cannot stop scamming from occurring, we are focussed on blocking scams where we can and empowering our customers to be vigilant.

We work to limit the number of scam calls our customers receive by monitoring unusual calling activity and blocking offending numbers. We also block many messages containing known 'bad URLs', to prevent customers inadvertently clicking on the links.

To further strengthen our defence against malicious activity, in February we integrated the Malware Free Networks service from the Government Communications Security Bureau's (GCSB's) National Cyber Security Centre into our network. This service helps to reduce incidences of mobile and broadband customers inadvertently downloading malware onto their devices, by blocking confirmed malicious websites on our network.

In April, we further enhanced our customer protections by introducing a new automated Short Message Service (SMS) scam firewall. The firewall, which is informed by a global database of confirmed scam content, significantly reduce the amount of scam texts being received. This is by our customers detecting URLs, phrases, and 'calls to action' that are known to be used in SMS scam campaigns, and blocking them - preventing them being received by the customer. We have been monitoring outgoing SMS traffic patterns from our own network in an effort to detect scams for many years, and while this has resulted in a significant reduction in scam SMSs sent from our own network, the new filter improves our ability to detect and block this activity coming through to our customers from other mobile networks as well.

During FY24 we added another layer of protection to help prevent people falling victim to fraudulent Spark impersonations via email, by adopting a technology called 'Brand Indicators for Message Identification' (BIMI). BIMI shows either our trademarked logo or a blue verification tick in the sender section of some email platforms when the communications are legitimate.

We also provide a number of products and services to further protect customers from scams. This includes a landline product called Call Screen, a cordless home phone that contains technology that can effectively help customers protect themselves from scam calls, and McAfee Security Standard on eligible broadband plans, which helps to protect customers from scams, viruses, and other threats.

While these measures collectively provide safer online experiences, we continue to regularly remind our customers of the evolving scam landscape and the importance of remaining vigilant online.

# Illegal child sexual abuse material (CSAM)

Child sexual abuse material is abhorrent and illegal and a growing issue in Aotearoa and globally. To help protect our customers from this content, and to help stop its dissemination, we implement a range of blocking measures on our network and provide additional tools for our customers to utilise on their own devices.

Spark has been a long-standing participant in the Department of Internal Affairs' (DIA) Digital Child Exploitation Filter, which blocks CSAM. Our Corporate Relations and

Sustainability Director is a member of the Independent Reference Group that maintains oversight of the filter.

During FY24 we announced an additional agreement with DIA to block access to websites containing CSAM on our network.

Building on this progress, in March we announced we would become the first New Zealand internet service provider to become a member of the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) allowing us to block CSAM contained on the Foundation's URL List on our network. This list includes criminal websites that have been individually assessed by an IWF analyst and is updated twice daily. We also formally endorsed WeProtect Global Alliance's '11 Voluntary Principles to Counter Online Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse', which provides a framework for the digital industry to help combat online child exploitation.

# Tools and education to protect our customers

We educate and alert customers to fraudulent activity through our scam alert webpage, our social media channels, direct customer communications, and via our customer service teams.

We also partner with Netsafe to develop and disseminate scam education material, such as brochures, which are available in store or online.

We also provide all our broadband customers with access to Net Shield, which helps to block harmful content and enables safe searching. Our customers can turn the Net Shield service on and off as regularly as needed, by logging into their account on the Spark website.

"We recognise the important role we must play in protecting our customers from the growing list of threats they face online – including scams, cyber security risks, and objectionable material."

# Using technology safely and protecting customer privacy

Using technology safely and protecting our customers' personal information are responsibilities we take seriously. As we continue to embed new technologies like data and analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) through our business processes, we also continue to evolve our approach to AI and data ethics, privacy, and governance, to ensure we have the right guardrails in place to protect our customers' information.

We are committed to keeping customers' personal information safe and managing it in ways that align with customer expectations, Spark's Artificial Intelligence Principles, Spark's Privacy Values, and the law, including the Privacy Act 2020, and the Telecommunications Information Privacy Code 2020.

# Data and AI governance

The rapid development of AI technologies brings many benefits to New Zealand, while also presenting increasingly complex challenges in ensuring that both data and data applications, are used by people and organisations ethically, safely, and lawfully.

Spark's use of AI is guided by our Artificial Intelligence Principles, which focus on a responsible and ethical approach to the design and operation of AI technologies within our business. Our principles are focussed around seven key areas: human centred; ethical design; diversity, inclusivity, and bias; safety and reliability; privacy; informed human decision-making; and expicability and transparency. These Principles are regularly reviewed and updated as we continue on our AI journey.

During FY24 we evolved our data governance strategy, restructuring our governance forums to enable a more targeted and purposeful approach.

We established an Al Executive Governance Committee, which provides executive oversight of Spark's deployment of Al across the business, including investment choices, benefit realisation, and associated changes to operating model design.

We also established a Data Ethics Committee, which is more specifically focussed on ensuring we are using data and data applications, including AI, ethically, legally, safely, and in line with stakeholder expectations.

Operational matters have now been integrated into our Information Security Risk Management Committee, which oversees data security and other risk domains more broadly.

The Data Ethics Committee includes representatives from the Leadership Squad, together with relevant subject matter experts and provides oversight as our Artificial Intelligence Principles are further embedded into our systems and processes.

Up until this year our use of AI within Spark has been narrowly deployed against specific use cases and controlled by a centralised, specialist team who have continued to ensure our use of this technology aligns to our Artificial Intelligence Principles. For example, we have used AI to implement data-driven marketing and to increase automation within our network.

The acceleration of Generative AI opens up new opportunities for a much broader number of Spark people to utilise AI in their day-to-day activities and is another pillar to our overall AI roadmap. We are piloting and then scaling different use cases across the business while enhancing our

deployment approach in a carefully structured and staged manner. As this occurs, we will establish clear ownership by senior leaders across the business for change management in their areas, supported by our subject matter experts, and while maintaining Leadership Squad oversight through our governance forums.

To support this, during FY24 the Data Ethics Committee oversaw the creation and adoption of a new Generative AI Policy. This is an internal policy that operationalises our Artificial Intelligence Principles by providing specific usage guidelines for our people who are working with Generative AI tools within Spark. We are now disseminating and embedding this policy, in line with the staged rollout of Generative AI tools across the business.

To further embed our AI principle of privacy into our processes, we also require all new AI work that uses personal information in a new way to go through a Privacy Impact Assessment, which is then reviewed by a Privacy Ambassador (as explained below) or Privacy Officer. The Privacy Ambassador either approves, declines or helps reframe requests that sit within guidelines, or escalates the request to the Privacy Officer and the Spark Legal team (as required) for further investigation and discussion. This process ensures that any privacy aspects of proposed data and AI work are considered prior to any development commencing.

# Our privacy programme

Spark's Digital Trust team leads Spark's privacy programme, providing frameworks, tools, and training to support Spark people to follow our Privacy Policy and Values.

# Internal processes and controls to safeguard customer privacy:

# Risk assessments

New products and services are assessed for any privacy risks, with appropriate mitigations embedded into their design and implementation. For many of our business units, these assessments are conducted by Spark Privacy Ambassadors - specially trained team members equipped with Spark-made assessment tools and supported by dedicated privacy experts. New vendors are also screened to ensure privacy will be managed appropriately.

# Personal information access management

Spark's Call Investigation Centre (CIC) manages requests for personal information from customers and government agencies. We report agency request volumes in our Spark Transparency Reports: www.spark.co.nz/help/privacy-and-safety/how-we-manage-privacy/spark-transparency-report

# - Responding to data breaches

Our dedicated Data Breach Reporting Tool enables any breaches to be reported by our people and managed in a customer-focussed way and in compliance with the Privacy Act 2020.

# Awareness and support for our people:

# - Privacy resources

Our Policy Playbook contains guides for applying privacy considerations to everyday activities and comprehensive resources are provided for our people online.

# - Privacy training

All our people must complete privacy training on joining and annually, to ensure privacy considerations and Privacy Act compliance remains top of mind.

![](images/65271be74d9e457ad25e08fae01421f3f0df701b7b3b0fd66821a761d5ec8ab2.jpg)

# - Resolving privacy issues

Our people are encouraged to raise any privacy issues they become aware of via the Digital Trust team or Spark's internal online whistleblowing tool, the Honesty Box.

# Supporting our customers:

- The Privacy and Online Safety section on our website contains a range of tools and services to help customers safely manage their privacy and security.

# Privacy compliance and reporting

In FY24 our people reported 228 data breaches for investigation, with 30 of these meeting the Privacy Act criteria for notification to affected individuals and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC). Most notifiable breaches involved fraudsters using personal information obtained from non-Spark sources, such as compromised online accounts or phishing (where fraudsters trick individuals into sharing their personal information).

As fraudsters' tactics continue to evolve, we continually review and update our internal processes and educate our customers around best practice password management and avoiding scams.

In FY24 Spark received 17 substantiated privacy complaints from customers and two substantiated complaints through the OPC. These enabled us to identify opportunities for targeted coaching or appropriate enhancements to our practices and processes.

# Legal and regulatory compliance

Under our Code of Ethics all our people are responsible for ensuring we behave ethically and comply fully with all applicable laws and regulations.

Spark's Legal and Compliance Policy sets out the specific accountabilities that our people have for complying with the law. Our people leaders make sure their teams have the information and training necessary to meet these standards, and our Legal and Digital Trust teams support our people with comprehensive frameworks, tools, training, and advice.

Every employee is required to complete online training modules on the Code of Ethics and how to apply it, and we reinforce this training through regular internal communication across the business. See: www.spark.co.nz/online/about/our-company/governance

We continue to engage constructively with the Commerce Commission as appropriate, both proactively and reactively, on a case-by-case basis to ensure we are complying with all applicable laws and regulations. This includes working proactively with the Commission on various 'retail service quality' (RSQ) initiatives such as consistency of mobile service coverage information.

There were no significant instances of non-compliance with laws or regulations, including in respect of marketing communications, in FY24.

# Investing in digital infrastructure and next evolution technology

New and emerging technologies, such as multi-access edge computing, cloud, IoT, and generative AI, are changing the way we work and connect.

These technologies are underpinned by a diverse range of digital infrastructure that is built and operated by Spark and other industry participants. This includes fibre backhaul, which provides the 'backbone' connectivity to our fixed and mobile networks; 5G infrastructure, which delivers enhanced network performance for our customers; submarine cables, which carry large amounts of data and connect New Zealand to the world; and data centres, which house the large amounts of data needed for these high-tech tools to operate.

During FY24, we invested over $350 million to deliver a highly secure, automated, and resilient network, and in the digital infrastructure that unlocks new commercialisation opportunities, supercharges the competitiveness of our products and services, and supports our customers to grow.

# Our AI and IT Transformation Programme

At Spark, investment in data and AI has been a key feature of our strategy for many years. These capabilities enable us to serve our customers more effectively by better anticipating their needs and help us to deliver our services more efficiently.

A pillar of SPK-26 is to create a simple data driven organisation. To deliver this ambition, we have established a Transformation Programme that brings together our work in AI and IT - with the aim of deepening our use of AI, while integrating data and IT across Spark to create efficiencies through the right architecture, automation, and standardisation.

We believe that broadening and deepening the use of AI in our business will deliver three key things:

- Better customer and people experiences  
- A fitter and faster business  
Higher growth

We have dedicated squads who are testing and deploying specific generative AI use cases into different parts of the business, to identify our biggest areas of opportunity. As an example, we are now using AI in our call centres to map customers to the right queue and help address their needs more quickly and effectively.

As we explore further AI use cases we are guided by our Artificial Intelligence Principles, our Privacy Values, and our Privacy Policy, which can be accessed on our website: www.spark.co.nz/online/about/our-company/governance.

See page 34 for further details on our AI Governance and Privacy.

# Investing in our data centres

Accelerating growth in our data centre business is a core focus of Spark's strategy. With data usage increasing exponentially, and the proliferation of generative AI, demand for data centre capacity is growing rapidly. We are well positioned to capture our share of this growth, with our nationwide data centre network, our own significant capacity usage, complementary digital infrastructure, such as our fibre networks and subsea cable assets, our relationships with cloud hyperscalers, and our ability to provide products and services direct to customers.

Our existing data centre portfolio includes 22.3 MW of total capacity focussed on Auckland (where most current data centre demand is), as well as regional centres such as the Waikato, Bay of Plenty, Wellington, Christchurch, and Dunedin.

In Auckland our ambition is to establish three large-scale data centre campuses, including our largest site at Takanini, our CBD site on Mayoral Drive, and a planned development on the North Shore.

In FY24 we completed a 10MW expansion of our Takanini campus on time and on budget, which now has a total capacity of 12.3MW. The expansion included a highly energy efficient cooling system, which uses ambient air to cool the data centre.

Following the conclusion of the financial year, in August, Spark entered into an agreement to purchase adjacent land at Takanini, bringing Takanini's total potential development pipeline to  $\sim 63\mathrm{MW}$ . Design is currently under way for a phased expansion.

This brings our overall development pipeline to 118MW, and when combined with our existing capacity, means we can grow our total data centre business to over 140MW in the future. As we invest in this growth opportunity, we are targeting returns of  $\sim 10 - 15\%$ .

![](images/3cdca70383927968dd7b9c1798d66d8f9ea6f4ea01d9233a4adcce40c1f0da5c.jpg)  
A render of the large-scale data centre on Auckland's North Shore.

Our Auckland CBD data centre is strategically sought after due to its customer ecosystem and location as a key connection point for international submarine cable systems and national networks. We are currently expanding capacity at this site to add an additional 1MW of capacity, and an adjacent Spark-owned site provides the potential to add another 15MW of capacity in the future.

During the year we also received resource consent to build a new, large-scale data centre on Auckland's North Shore as part of a 43-hectare masterplan development with global surf park creators Aventuur. The development will use an innovative heat exchange system enabling excess heat produced by the data centre to warm the water of the nearby surfing lagoon, while an onsite seven-hectare solar farm will supply renewable energy back into the data centre.

The North Shore site will become Spark's third strategic Auckland location, with capacity for a staged build of a 40MW campus over time.

Outside of Auckland, during the year we also partnered with the University of Waikato to take over the management of its existing data centre facility on campus, with the University becoming an anchor customer at the site. We have further investment planned to upgrade and grow capacity and operate the site as a key edge data centre for Spark and our business customers. An edge data centre is located closer to where the data is being used, reducing the time it takes for data to travel back and forth. This enables faster access and better performance for various applications and services.

2. In August, Spark entered into a conditional agreement to purchase land at Takanini, which would add 48MW to the site. This increased the total development pipeline from 70MW at the end of FY24 to 118MW at time of publishing.

# Unlocking the power of 5G

Our national 5G rollout has continued at pace, with 5G now live in 103 locations across Aotearoa, from large cities to smaller regional towns. This means almost half the population can now access 5G through Spark's network.

As we build our 5G network across the country, we are also working on making it more advanced and powerful. 5G is not just about faster internet on your phone, it can also improve the performance and reliability of many services and applications, such as video streaming, gaming, and smart solutions. We are currently deploying a 5G core network, which will deliver a true end-to-end 5G experience, without any dependency on legacy technologies – known as 5G standalone.

5G standalone allows us to create different service slices of the network that can be tailored for different purposes, referred to as network slicing. This means we can optimise the network to suit the specific needs of different customers and industries.

We are already testing this technology across a range of different use cases with customers. For example, we have recently started a trial that brings together a 5G Standalone private network with AI computer vision to help keep people safe in a manufacturing environment. Cameras detect whether people are wearing the appropriate safety gear, while blurring the images for privacy. Anyone who is not complying with the health and safety requirements will appear red on the screen, enabling intervention. This can enhance accident prevention and injury reduction across a wide range of industries.

"Our national 5G rollout has continued at pace, with 5G now live in 103 locations."

# The Internet of Things (IoT)

Spark IoT connections have continued to grow, surpassing two million during FY24.

IoT solutions enable businesses to monitor things in the natural and physical worlds around them, collecting data that can then be analysed and used to inform decision-making. We deliver these solutions through a range of different Spark IoT networks, each catering to different business use cases depending on bandwidth and coverage requirements. Specialist IoT devices are used to record and capture the data customers want to monitor, and IoT platforms with dashboard and alert features can be used by our customers to act immediately on the insights gathered.

In October, Spark acquired all of the remaining shares in Adroit, a leading Internet of Things provider that specialises in technology solutions for real-time environmental monitoring, with solutions that are used across worksites, construction, agriculture, aquaculture, councils, and infrastructure sectors.

During the year, Spark's Innovation Studio underwent a refresh to bring it up to speed with the rapid pace of technological change. The refreshed Studio showcases the latest innovative technologies across

![](images/4e3853732b8337fcc92b724d1be692babaa694a2cb0495799aab948837d54381.jpg)  
The updated Innovation Studio.

different customer use cases, including asset management, critical communications, smart environments, construction, water, and emerging technology. Since its opening in 2021, the Studio has seen over 400 tour groups across businesses and

industry coming through to learn more about technologies, such as AI, computer vision, and IoT, and to view real-life examples from local organisations who are using these technologies to solve business problems.

# Using IoT for continuous monitoring of geotechnical environments

Many areas in New Zealand are prone to slips, resulting in delays and road closures. This is particularly relevant with the increase in extreme weather events in Aotearoa. Monitoring for tilt or slope changes can be hazardous, labour-intensive, and time-consuming, resulting in delayed data gathering, health and safety risks, and a lack of accuracy.

Adroit has been working with customers in the infrastructure sector to provide an IoT solution using satellite-connected Tiltmeter technology, to monitor tilt or slope changes in various structures or geotechnical environments.

Highly accurate rotation data allows trend monitoring that can help detect movement of slopes and structures, as well as being used as early warning systems for catastrophic structural failure. Real-time data allows for immediate analysis and interpretation of monitoring results, which in turn enables quick decision-making and timely intervention to mitigate risks - providing early warning of potential hazards, such as landslides, sinkholes, or structural instability.

Tiltmeters can be instrumental in preventing road closures and keeping New Zealand's biggest industries moving around the country.

# "Technology convergence has an important role to play in boosting productivity and sustainability outcomes across our economy."

# The convergence of our high-tech capabilities

Up until now our high-tech capabilities - such as 5G standalone, AI, and IoT - have operated largely independently of each other, but globally we are seeing a rapid acceleration of technology convergence. Converged solutions bring these different technologies together to solve business problems where it was not possible or cost-effective to do so in the past.

Considering the challenges New Zealand businesses are currently facing, we believe technology convergence has an important role to play in boosting productivity and sustainability outcomes across our economy.

During FY24 we have embarked on a number of converged technology customer trials, to inform our development of key use cases that can be scaled further in future years.

# Harnessing converged technology to make the fishing industry more sustainable

In FY24 Spark worked with the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) to install cameras on inshore commercial fishing vessels to help verify fishers' reported catch and effort data and to ensure the sustainability of New Zealand marine life is managed by the fishing industry in a modern way. This technology solution is breaking new ground by bringing together on-board cameras with IoT, AI, machine learning, cloud computing, and data and analytics.

Spark is providing the technology, cameras, software, and transmission process that enables the verification of fisher-reported data, to help inform fisheries management decision-making. An important component of the system is the processing of video footage that happens onboard the vessel. Previously, all data had to be put on a disc and couriered, but with this automated system, when a vessel is in range of Spark's 4G mobile network, the footage is uploaded to the cloud, where further processing takes place.

Using AI and machine learning, when the system detects human in-frame activities, the cameras move into high-definition capture and the relevant encrypted footage is stored and marked for upload. This reduces footage storage and review costs and allows for more targeted review of the footage by MPI, while also protecting fishers' privacy by targeting in-frame activities.

# Enhancing the resilience of our network

Our customers rely on us to provide networks and technology that is highly reliable in the face of unpredictable events. We make significant investments into network resiliency annually, and following increasingly severe weather events around Aotearoa, we have been focussed on how resilience to natural disasters can be further enhanced.

# Working collaboratively as an industry

As an industry, we invest heavily in disaster preparedness, with around $1.62 billion being invested each year to maintain and upgrade networks. During major incidents, the sector comes together through our industry group, the Telecommunications Forum (TCF), which coordinates operators, other infrastructure sectors, including electricity and roading, as well as government, to restore services.

Over the last year, mobile network operators have continued working together to identify critical sites offering widespread coverage so they can be prioritised for restoration.

# Maintaining coverage during power outages

One of the main reasons for telecommunications outages is a loss of power. Most of our mobile sites are equipped with battery backup and the ability to connect standalone generators when those battery reserves are exhausted, which provides short-term continuity of coverage during power outages. We are now working with our partners to extend battery life on major, critical sites to ensure they can withstand power outages for longer periods of time.

We are also working on an automation solution for our cell towers to improve the management of power consumption during power outages. This means that our cell towers will be able to monitor their own power consumption, detect when they are unable to draw power from the grid, and automatically prioritise connectivity for essential communications functions, such as calls and texts.

# Establishing Aotearoa's Public Safety Network

We have established a joint venture with One NZ to support the operational capability of New Zealand's emergency services through the establishment of the Public Safety Network. The Network, which was established by Next Generation Critical Communications Poutama Whai Tikanga Papaho, is used by New Zealand's frontline emergency responders, including Fire and Emergency New Zealand, Police, Hato Hone St John, and Wellington Free Ambulance, and provides emergency services teams with access to roaming across both the Spark and One NZ networks, to improve redundancy.

# Deploying satellite to bolster resilience

Satellite has an important role to play by adding an additional layer of resilience to traditional networks.

While using fibre to connect cell towers to the network ensures we can support the day-to-day activities New Zealanders expect to be able to do on their mobile phones, fibre cables run along the ground, including under roads and over bridges, both of which can become damaged during a natural disaster. This is where

satellite backhaul plays an important role in resilience - substituting fibre temporarily to allow for basic connectivity, such as texts and calls.

During the year we established a network of satellite-connected small cells throughout the country, which can be deployed to provide access to a basic level of mobile connectivity during emergencies when fibre backhaul (which connects a cell tower back into the network) becomes compromised.

These satellite-connected emergency small cells are housed in five strategic locations in Northland, Auckland, Gisborne, Palmerston North, and Canterbury, making them readily available to deploy should the Spark mobile network be impacted by a fibre outage.

Our longer-term ambition is to enable our strategically placed permanent cell towers to automatically switch to satellite backhaul if required, ensuring we can provide connectivity when our customers need it most.

We are also currently trialling direct satellite-to-mobile technology with our partner Lynk Global, before offering the service to Spark customers at scale as more satellites are deployed.

![](images/cb25c381e683d88cb697a6f7ef5e4674154f18e55063f547dc997d3b35804d5b.jpg)

# Improving customer experiences and resilience through AI and automation

We are trialling the use of generative AI and machine learning to detect anomalies in the network and generate insights for our engineers, such as 'I have observed multiple voice call drops in a metro site in Auckland'. This enables our engineers to quickly turn their attention to that site, diagnose the issue, and respond to prevent it becoming more widespread.

We are also running trials of generative AI within our operations team. This will allow us to interact and query various knowledge bases in real time using simple prompts such as, 'I want to see how many users on a cell site are impacted by this issue' or 'I want to see why traffic is unusually slow on this cell tower'. This also has the potential to predict maintenance requirements and automate corrective actions in future.

# Working with government to improve resilience

While we are making great progress in preparing our network for future disruptions, we are committed to working alongside the industry and government to explore further opportunities to improve resilience.

To support this, we are engaging with officials to ensure important policy enablers that support network resiliency are in place. This includes the continued release of spectrum, which enables us to keep extending 5G coverage; ensuring proposed Resource Management Act 1991 reforms support the rollout of telecommunications infrastructure in a changing built environment; ensuring digital infrastructure is considered in Aotearoa's climate change planning; enabling cross-sector collaboration on resilience; and ongoing investment in public and private partnerships, like the Rural Connectivity Group.

![](images/807f8ecf4da7f2da5b01125b5c59e693e3e34b23740a0763eca0462312860432.jpg)

# A stronger backbone for our network

Over recent years we have been investing in the next generation of our Optical Transport Network (OTN), which is the fibre backbone of our network and connects Aotearoa's major cities to the core of the network.

Last year, we completed building our OTN 2.0, which has multiple redundancy paths and 'self-healing' capabilities. This means it enables the light signals that carry data up and down the country to automatically divert to an alternative path if a fibre cut occurs, swiftly restoring services where it is possible to do so.

Our OTN 2.0 has seven times the data capacity of the OTN, which is supporting our 5G rollout and providing our fixed and mobile networks with enough capacity to meet ongoing growth in data consumption.

We are also building our access and aggregation network which will provide diverse paths between our cell towers and our OTN 2.0, with its own self-healing capabilities to improve resilience further.

Additionally, we have three geographically diverse, highly resilient Spark network data centres providing core voice and mobile services located in Auckland, Porirua, and Christchurch.

# Connecting New Zealand with the world

During FY24, we completed the fourth upgrade of the Tasman Global Access Network (TGA) cable system through a consortium with Telstra and One NZ. This further increases capacity on the cable to service growing demand for connectivity between Australia and New Zealand.

# Connecting rural Aotearoa

Improving rural connectivity remains a key priority for Spark as we, alongside our industry partners, work to close the geographical digital divide. While our networks reach  $98\%$  of New Zealanders, there are significant challenges in providing coverage across mountainous, foliage-dense terrain, with highly dispersed populations.

# The Rural Connectivity Group

We are a partner in the Rural Connectivity Group (RCG), a joint venture with One NZ and 2degrees that enables us to share the costs of building rural mobile infrastructure where it would otherwise not be commercially viable.

In June, the RCG connected its 500th rural cell site at Anawhata, serving a coastal community between Piha and Bethells Beach on Auckland's west coast. As a result of the connectivity provided by the RCG, 33,000 previously unconnected

![](images/f3da0985521de9feae9e5211b9ac88f01817380e0d64ca698ab28529f8f0f6fd.jpg)

households across the country now have internet connectivity, and mobile coverage is available across thousands of kilometres of roads and 110 tourist hotspots.

Last year, Spark, One NZ, and 2degrees each committed an additional $24 million in funding to the RCG between 2023 and 2025, as part of an agreement with the Crown to expand mobile coverage further into rural New Zealand and reduce mobile black spots on state highways.

We have also accelerated our own deployment of 5G in the regions, with 5G connectivity now available in 103 towns with a population over 1,500 - which is  $66\%$  of our FY26 ambition.

# Connecting rural marae

The Marae Digital Connectivity Programme aims to improve digital access in provincial and rural Aotearoa by connecting marae to reliable internet and providing iwi, hapū, and whānau with access to technology, including cloud storage, digital security networks, and state-of-the-art hardware. Spark is the key delivery partner working alongside Te Puni Kōkiri and Crown Infrastructure Partners.

One of the immediate benefits has been enabling whānau who lived elsewhere to stay connected to their hapū and join hui or wānanga virtually. The technology will also help marae to work with their rangatahi to support new skills development, while supporting local communities to innovate and create new business opportunities - such as hosting wānanga or conferences and collaborating virtually.

Comprehensive training on how to use the technology was rolled out around the country by Te Wānanga o Aotearoa as part of the initiative and a total of 659 marae have been connected through the programme at the end of FY24.

# Migrating customers off legacy technology onto future-proof alternatives

We continue to migrate customers off end-of-life technology and onto modern alternatives already used by the majority of New Zealanders across the country, such as fibre and wireless. This includes the retirement of the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and our 3G network.

# Retiring the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)

The Spark-operated PSTN - the traditional way of providing landline services - was built in the 1980s and is rapidly reaching end-of-life. The network's components have not been manufactured since 2003 and the people with the skills needed to maintain it are getting harder to find.

The majority of New Zealanders have already made the switch to fibre or wireless proactively. In 2017, we had over a million customer lines on the PSTN, by the end of FY24 only 77,000 remained. Around 3,200 customer lines, on average, migrate off this technology every month. As customers move off the PSTN, we are able to decommission legacy PSTN equipment. To date, we have decommissioned almost  $65\%$  of our PSTN switches, which has resulted in a significant decrease in our power usage and carbon emissions.

Over the past year, we developed and implemented a solution for customers who rely on the legacy PSTN system for their voice services but have limited access to fibre or wireless alternatives. The solution, called MSAN (multi-service access nodes) enables our customers to maintain their copper line but instead of using the PSTN switch, it connects them to our new Access and Aggregation Network. This solution enables us to continue decommissioning PSTN switches while ensuring our customers remain connected until more advanced solutions become available in their region.

In a separate programme to Spark's PSTN shut down, Chorus is gradually withdrawing its copper network as it also reaches end-of-life. The copper network includes the physical lines carrying calls and data.

We have a dedicated customer service team for customers going through either a PSTN or copper migration and offer free in-home visits where required.

# Closing our 3G network to make way for 5G in rural Aotearoa

In FY23 we confirmed that we will close down our legacy 3G network towards the end of 2025. The 3G network currently uses limited radio spectrum that is required to rollout 5G in rural areas, so closing it will enable us to re-farm that spectrum for use in our rural 5G rollout.

We recognise that this network closure may cause concern for the few rural communities where there is currently only 3G available, which is why we have continued to enhance our 4G network in these areas ahead of the closure.

At the same time, we are aware that some of our customers are still connecting to 3G in areas where 4G is available. Predominantly, this is due to customers using devices that can't make voice calls over 4G (mobile voice calls over 4G are technically known as VoLTE - Voice over LTE) and therefore still use 3G, so we have continued working with customers to make sure that these devices are replaced ahead of the 3G network closure.

# Creating value for our environment

Natural capital

# OUTCOMES

Protecting the environment and enabling positive environmental outcomes through our customers' use of technology

We rely upon natural capital through the diverse materials drawn from around the world to manufacture the physical assets that make up our networks and technology, and the devices our customers use. We also draw upon natural resources to power our technology and our broader business operations.

Our networks, distributed across New Zealand, are also impacted by changes in the environment, which has implications for the resilience of our infrastructure and the supporting services required to operate them.

Through the products and services we provide, our customers are able to live and work more sustainably and productively, enabling them to reduce their impact on the environment and use of natural resources.

We can reduce our draw on natural capital and shift towards circular and renewable operating models. And by being deliberate about our role in enabling emissions reductions and climate adaptation, we can ensure our customers and all of New Zealand can realise the benefits of digital technology in protecting natural capital and responding to environmental challenges.

# Our approach to environmental management

We have a focus on continuous improvement in our environmental management. Despite this, we saw a significant increase in our scope 1 and 2 emissions in FY24, putting us above our emissions reduction target pathway - our primary environmental KPI. See page 49 for more information on our performance.

Spark's Environmental Policy sets out our expectations for our people to consider environmental impacts when making decisions at work, including examining our business practices, understanding their impacts, and taking reasonable steps to reduce our environmental footprint. This is available at: www.spark.co.nz/online/about/our-company/governance

To help our people understand their role in creating a sustainable Spark, we have an online training module for all employees that provides information on our approach to sustainability and our expectation that our people consider environmental impacts in their day-to-day activities. We also communicate our progress to our employees through regular sustainability newsletters and direct engagement with teams across the business.

Working within Spark's agile operating model we have an established governance process to manage our most material environmental topics. This includes an Emissions Reduction Squad, led by our Environment Manager and comprising employees working in a variety of roles across the Spark Group. This squad is split into three workstreams, focussed on mobile networks, data centres, and fleet. Over the past year the squad worked to build energy costs and emissions considerations into our capital deployment and funding decision-making processes and templates.

We measure and report our energy use and emissions on a quarterly basis, alongside other broader sustainability KPIs, to our Leadership Squad. The Leadership Squad acts as a steering committee for sustainability across Spark through a

standing agenda item at quarterly meetings. We believe sustainability is relevant to all areas of the business, so key updates and decisions are participated in by all members of our Leadership Squad. The Spark Board is provided a sustainability update on a quarterly basis, including as part of annual integrated reporting for year-end. In the past year these updates covered a range of topics, including performance against KPIs (including tracking emissions and energy use) and also on broader topics, such as climate risk.

# Technology for emissions reduction

We believe technology has an important role to play in enabling emissions reductions across our economy. The role of digital technology in enabling decarbonisation is broad - it provides secure access to remote services, which helps people to reduce commuting; it can connect and monitor physical assets and natural environments, which creates insights that people and systems can then act on; it can influence behaviour; and it

# 7.2Mt

The annual emissions reduction digital technologies can support by 2030.

underpins the creation of low-carbon industries and jobs. To quantify this role, we undertook research with thinkstep-anz during our last financial year. Through this study we found that digital technologies can support annual emissions reductions of 7.2 Mt by 2030 - equivalent to  $42\%$  of the reductions required to meet Aotearoa's carbon budget targets. This highlights the opportunity for Spark to support our business customers to respond to climate change through our broad range of technology solutions.

During the year we continued to advocate for technology to be integrated into the Government's next Emissions Reduction Plan, to ensure Aotearoa realises the full potential digital technology can bring to the climate challenge.

In partnership with NZTech, the Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment, and the Ministry for the Environment, we supported the development of a framework for New Zealand's first Climate Technology Roadmap. Climate Technology Roadmaps have been used in many offshore markets to integrate technology into national climate responses. The Technology for Emissions Reduction report is a first step towards developing such a Roadmap for New Zealand and draws on perspectives from hundreds of New Zealand businesses to provide actionable steps to integrate climate technology into business practices.

# Spark's SBTi-verified science-based emissions reduction target

The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) is established as the global standard for corporate emissions reduction targets. Over 5,000 organisations have set verified emissions reduction targets since it launched in 2015.

All SBTi targets must have a strict absolute reduction target for scope 1 and 2 emissions and also include a separate scope 3 target if these emissions are greater than  $40\%$  of the total footprint.

SBTi targets are set against sector-specific emissions trajectories. The ICT sector pathways were developed with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) based on projected growth and efficiency gains.

The wording of SBTi targets are set and verified by the Science Based Targets initiative, and follow a common format requiring companies to 'commit' to the target that has been established. For Spark this is as follows:

Spark New Zealand commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions  $56\%$  by 2030 from a FY2020 base year.

Spark New Zealand commits that  $70\%$  of its suppliers by spend covering purchased goods and services and capital goods, will have SBTi-aligned targets in place by 2026.

This means Spark is committed to pursuing this target and we are working towards it. For clarity, this is not a guarantee that we will meet this target.

# Spark climate-related disclosures

Our climate-related disclosures include climate risk reporting, which has been prepared in compliance with the Aotearoa New Zealand Climate Standards (NZ CS 1, NZ CS 2 and NZ CS 3) issued by the External Reporting Board (XRB). See page 90.

# Spark's SBTi target covers our scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions sources

# SCOPE 1

Direct emissions from sources owned or controlled by Spark

# Performance against our scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction target

In the past year we saw our emissions increase, with our scope 1 and 2 emissions up  $26.7\%$ . This means we are tracking  $18.6\%$  above the SBTi pathway required to reach our  $56\%$  reduction target from FY20 to FY30.

The majority of this increase was driven by our scope 1 emissions, which rose by  $73.4\%$ . This significant rise was primarily due to a one-time event that led to higher fugitive emissions. Without this event we would be tracking  $5.7\%$  above our scope 1 and 2 SBTi pathway. See 'Fugitive emissions' on page 52 where we explain the reason for this increase.

We also saw increases in our scope 2 emissions due to higher electricity usage and the higher emissions factor of the New Zealand grid. Our scope 2 electricity use, which powers our networks and infrastructure, remains our largest overall source of emissions related to our direct operations, at  $72.3\%$  of our total scope 1

and 2 emissions. The emissions intensity of the electricity we use is dependent on whether it is generated renewably or from fossil fuels, such as coal and gas. The mix of sources determines our emissions factor per unit of electricity.

Over the past year our scope 2 emissions increased  $14.8\%$ , driven by a  $2.6\%$  increase in electricity consumption and an  $11.9\%$  increase in the grid emissions factor. See 'Electricity consumption' on page 50 for more information.

Our scope 1 emissions associated with fleet also increased slightly, up  $6.6\%$  compared to FY23. This was due to more diesel consumption as a result of additional field service vehicles added to our Entelar Group fleet. We saw a decrease in reported stationary diesel combustion emissions (measured through diesel purchase records from the year) of 82 tonne of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{e}$ , down  $20.9\%$  compared to FY23. This reduction was due to having no major diesel tank top-ups this year, in contrast to FY23 where a significant volume of diesel was purchased to fill tanks at our new data centre facilities.

# Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report

We publish a standalone Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report alongside our Annual Report. It includes detailed reporting on our emissions and energy use. See www.spark.co.nz/online/about/sustainability/environment for more information.

![](images/3dbe92afd828091b594cb679f8b0e107ed74bfbca4504659b61e6a95bd960321.jpg)

# Electricity consumption

In the past year we have seen an increase in electricity consumption across the Spark Group, as we have continued to rollout our 5G network and invested to increase data centre capacity. Overall electricity consumption is up  $2.6\%$ , from 152.6 GWh to 156.6 GWh.

The majority of the variance in our emissions since setting our target against our FY20 baseline has been in changes to annual hydrological conditions impacting hydroelectric generation. This saw a significant increase in non-renewable electricity generation on the New Zealand grid in FY21. In FY22 and FY23 this trend was reversed, with a cleaner electricity mix and underlying reductions in energy use delivering significant emissions reduction over the previous two years.

In FY24 we saw this trend reverse again, with a slight increase in the grid emissions factor, which is up from  $0.0696\mathrm{kg / kWh^b}$  to  $0.0779\mathrm{kg / kWh}$ , an  $11.9\%$  increase.

"Our strategy is to decouple our business growth from emissions growth by working in partnership with our energy partner to utilise our electricity procurement to support the development of new renewable energy generation in New Zealand."

# Long-term energy plan

A reliable and sustainable supply of energy is essential to power Spark's infrastructure and to enable future growth. The New Zealand energy system is facing a number of challenges from the impacts of climate change, the increased pressure put on generation through electrification of industrial processes, and the longer-term transition to  $100\%$  renewable electricity generation. Because of this, a focus on efficient use of energy is important.

The largest user of electricity across the Spark Group is our fixed networks, which includes our exchanges and legacy copper networks. We have a long-running programme of network simplification, including the decommissioning of legacy equipment, such as the public switched telephone network (PSTN), which has driven year-on-year reductions in electricity use across our business. Over the last year our fixed network energy consumption reduced  $5.5\%$ . We will continue to reduce electricity consumption through a focus on energy efficiency and removing old, inefficient equipment.

We expect our fixed network consumption to continue to decrease over time, with our data centres set to become our largest energy users over the medium term. In FY24, our electricity consumption associated with data centres increased by  $8.2\%$ . Our investment in expanded connectivity, network capacity, and data centre capacity is important to support innovation and enable emissions reductions across all sectors of the economy. However, we cannot pursue this growth without also reducing our own emissions against our SBTi target pathway.

Our strategy is to decouple our business growth from emissions growth by working in partnership with our energy partner to utilise our electricity procurement to support the development of new renewable energy generation in New Zealand. This creates additional generation capacity to meet growing demand and supports New Zealand's overarching climate goals. In May we announced a renewable energy partnership with Genesis Energy.

![](images/5d8056e8df9219f45a9a4c7bcc6f77c4e2f86b04e6b1c282a630a1b0fbbc0caa.jpg)

a. Gigawatt hours (GWh).  
b. Kilowatt hour (kWh).  
c. The Residual Supply Factor is the grid emission factor we use to calculate our market-based scope 2 emissions to measure performance against our emissions target. It is the amount of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  e per unit of electricity consumed.

# Renewable energy partnership with Genesis Energy

Through our existing energy supply agreement, dating back to 2021, Spark has been working with our energy partner, Genesis Energy, on opportunities to work together to achieve Spark's SBTi target. In May 2024 this culminated in the announcement of a new renewable energy partnership with Genesis.

Under a ten-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), we will purchase all of the electricity generated by Genesis' first solar farm in Lauriston Canterbury. The 63MW Lauriston solar farm is expected to generate enough electricity to meet  $60\%$  of our current annual requirements and will make a significant contribution towards our scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction target.

The energy generated by the Lauriston site will be zero-carbon and we will be able to count this renewable energy against our market-based scope 2 emissions target through the transfer of Renewable Energy Certificates. These certificates transfer the renewable attributes of the energy to Spark and enable transparent tracking and reporting.

In exploring renewable energy partnership opportunities, it was important to us to support investment in new renewable energy - rather than buying certificates for existing renewables that were added to the grid many years ago. It is only through the addition of new renewable sources that New Zealand's grid will further decarbonise and our country will reach its long-term climate goals. Long-term commercial commitments, delivered by

PPAs, support new renewable generation to become operational faster by providing projects with commercial backing and increasing confidence to invest in further developments.

Under the agreement, the remaining  $40\%$  of our electricity needs will continue to be sourced by Genesis from the grid as occurs today. However, as we continue to grow our energy use, and we look beyond our FY30 emissions target to our long-term transition to net-zero, we will ultimately need to transition  $100\%$  of our electricity consumption to new renewable sources. The partnership with Genesis includes a commitment to explore additional renewable energy opportunities, supporting Genesis to achieve its target to have  $95\%$  renewable generation by 2035.

# Fugitive emissions

In FY24 we worked closely with our refrigerant supplier to enhance our fugitive emissions reporting. Beginning in Q3, we now receive monthly refrigerant recharge data. This improvement has allowed us to transition from a screening method to a more accurate measurement of refrigerant recharges, enabling year-round monitoring. Through this improved methodology, we identified slow refrigerant leaks as the most common source of fugitive emissions.

During the last quarter of the year, an alarm triggered a fire suppressant gas flood response at one of our exchange sites. Due to the high global warming potential of the gas released, this incident resulted in emissions of 1,892 tonnes  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  e. This contributed to a  $311\%$  increase in our fugitive emissions compared to FY23. In FY25 we plan to deploy IoT sensors across relevant assets and investigate low-carbon refrigerant alternatives to avoid similar events occurring in the future.

# Our fleet

In FY24, Spark's fleet was responsible for  $10.5\%$  of our reported scope 1 and 2 emissions. Our FY24 fleet emissions were up  $6.6\%$  on the previous year, due to increased fuel use in the fleet of our subsidiary Entelar Group. Entelar Group provides services to all of New Zealand, including network and fibre build and maintenance. This work requires an extensive tool-of-trade fleet that is partially made up of diesel fuelled utes and vans. To keep pace with business demands, Entelar added 19 diesel vehicles to its field fleet in FY24, while also looking for opportunities to adopt more sustainable options, including 26 new hybrids to support non-field operations and the ongoing removal of petrol vehicles.

We introduced our 'Electric First' policy for the Spark corporate fleet in FY22, with all vehicles due for renewal to be replaced by an electric vehicle (EV). Over the past year

we have made great progress in transitioning our Spark Corporate fleet to EV. However, we continue to face challenges across the Spark Group, particularly in areas where low-carbon alternatives for tool-of-trade vehicles are limited. We also have roles that require long-distance travel or involve areas with insufficient fast charging infrastructure, proving a barrier to the uptake of EV.

For those who have range and charging issues, we have looked to extend the leases on hybrid vehicles. Additionally, when a low-carbon vehicle is no longer needed in one part of the business, we reassign it to another driver who is operating a less efficient vehicle, improving the overall efficiency of our fleet. We are continually monitoring the New Zealand market for new electric vehicle options, focussing on models that offer extended range and field-service capabilities.

# Our scope 3 emissions

Scope 3 emissions refer to the emissions that are created across a company's value chain. For example, the emissions created by the manufacturing of goods and delivery of services used to run a business, or through the use of the products and services customers buy from that business. At Spark this includes a wide variety of sources, including the production of purchased goods, transportation, business travel, and the way our customers use our products.

# Performance against our scope 3 supplier engagement target

The percentage of our spend with suppliers with SBTi-aligned targets in place has increased to around  $43\%$ , up from  $33\%$  last year. A number of our largest suppliers by spend are our peers in the New Zealand telecommunications sector. One of our key local suppliers achieved SBTi verification of their science-based target in the past year, a second is finalising an SBTi-verified target, and a third has committed to set a target in the next two years. Across our global supply chain approximately  $21\%$  of our spend is with suppliers that have publicly committed to setting targets within the next two years.

As we have strengthened our ethical supply chain processes we have implemented a process to survey key suppliers on an annual basis. This provides an opportunity to gather more data on supplier environmental governance, compliance, and commitments, including emissions reduction targets and alignment and validation against SBTi methodology. For global suppliers our membership of the global industry group, the Joint Audit Cooperation (JAC) initiative, provides a platform to engage suppliers alongside other telecommunications companies with similar SBTi-verified supplier engagement targets. For more information on our approach to engaging suppliers on sustainability and ESG matters, refer to our Modern Slavery and Human Rights Statement: www.spark.co.nz/online/about/our-company/governance

# Business travel

Flights and business travel are classed as scope 3 emissions, so are not included in our scope 1 and 2 SBTi emissions reduction target. However, business travel is a significant source of emissions that can be easily influenced by our policies and behaviour.

Following the post-Covid travel rebound we saw in FY23, emissions associated with business travel have reduced by  $13\%$  in FY24, which is  $35.4\%$  below our FY20 baseline. We saw a decrease across all business travel activities, and most notably a  $32.1\%$  reduction in domestic air travel emissions.

To contain growth in business travel we have implemented a new sign-off process for international travel. We have also built quarterly travel data into our sustainability dashboard to maintain greater oversight and determine whether any further action is required to manage business travel.

# Reducing e-waste

Electronic waste is our most significant waste impact. We produce a significant volume of electronic waste across our direct operations and indirectly through the downstream impacts of customer equipment at end-of-life. E-waste also includes valuable and potentially hazardous elements. It is therefore important for us to focus on circularity in our e-waste management, to enable materials to be recycled and to reduce environmental harm through improper disposal.

# E-waste and network recycling

Spark has a long-standing programme to manage end-of-life network equipment and technology. Recovered equipment is separated into different waste streams - such as printed circuit boards, copper cables, lead batteries, and all types of metals. These materials are processed by our local recycling partners and then some components are sent overseas for recycling, reselling, or reusing.

In FY24 we recovered a total of 450 tonnes of e-waste, down from 559 tonnes in FY23. Of this, 138 tonnes were network e-waste (down 16 tonnes on FY23) and 312 tonnes were metals, cables, and batteries (down 101 tonnes). The reduction in recovered e-waste was the result of fewer PSTN switches being decommissioned in FY24 compared to FY23, as well as a number of smaller switches being removed compared to previous years. We continue to improve our recycling collections focussing on education within Spark and working with some of our larger customers to support them to responsibly recycle their surplus equipment.

Alongside the Spark Foundation, we also support the Recycle A Device (RAD) scheme through our subsidiary, Entelar Group, to provide logistics support towards the collection and refurbishment of used laptops for students and others in the community in need of a device. See page 60 for more information.

# Mobile phone recycling and trade-ins

In FY24 Spark received 16,425 mobile devices for recycling and trade-in, up from 15,119 in FY23. This increase was due to a rise in trade-in numbers. Trade-ins are becoming more popular with our customers, allowing them to unlock value from their older devices. Most trade-in devices we receive go on to be refurbished and resold, extending their lifecycle and keeping them in circulation. When we receive devices that are unable to be redeployed, we recover essential materials and send them on to be reused in new products.

# Product stewardship scheme development

Following the 2020 amendment to the Waste Minimisation Act 2008, electrical and electronic products have been designated as Priority Products. This designation mandates the implementation of product stewardship schemes, ensuring manufacturers, importers, and retailers take responsibility for the entire lifecycle of these products.

Spark is a member of the Telecommunication Forum's (TCF's) RE:MOBILE product stewardship scheme, one of the first industry schemes voluntarily accredited by the Ministry for the Environment (MfE) under the provisions of the 2008 Act. The RE:MOBILE scheme takes unused mobile phones, and either refurbishes and on-sells them in overseas markets or recycles them to recover the materials used. Profit from the scheme is donated to the charity Sustainable Coastlines.

The accreditation for RE:MOBILE lapsed in April 2021 and TCF is now seeking re-accreditation under the new provisions in the 2020 Act. MfE continues to recognise the scheme as TCF work through this process. Spark is a part of the TCF Product Stewardship working group contributing to the review of RE:MOBILE and the re-accreditation process.

Proposed design for Spark's Takanini data centre expansion.

# Our water usage

We practise water conservation across our data centre portfolio, using it only when necessary for maintaining humidity, equipment upkeep, and the evaporative cooling of outdoor chillers during hot weather. At sites with closed-loop cooling systems, water is recirculated, eliminating the need for ongoing consumption.

Water is also a key consideration in the design of our data centres. Our newest pod at the Takanini data centre uses a free air-cooling system, utilising the ambient outdoor air to cool servers and equipment. Our future data centres are being designed to use similar air-cooled methods or closed loop cooling systems to minimise reliance on municipal water supply.

In FY25 we plan to introduce new processes to measure our total water consumption across all business operations, including our data centres. We will also implement IoT water metering systems where we require further insights into our consumption, to enable more detailed reporting in the future.

# OUTCOMES

Connected and empowered communities

We work alongside New Zealand communities to harness the power of technology to create a positive digital future for all. Our products and services help our communities to stay connected and enable the provision of community services. Beyond the direct impacts of our products, we want to play a bigger role in building healthy, connected, and equitable communities.

# Championing digital equity

At Spark our commitment to digital equity starts with our purpose - to help all of New Zealand win big in a digital world.

Digital equity starts with having access to devices and a connection to the internet but it doesn't stop there. To close the digital divide our communities need the skills to use technology, trust in the digital world, and the motivation to participate.

# Spark's investment into the community

In FY24 we committed nearly $10 million in free data and funding, as well as significant internal resources, to achieve our digital equity ambitions and contribute to our communities.

In FY24 Spark donated nearly $2 million to Spark Foundation, with $1.5 million designated specifically for community projects, and the remaining funding operational costs.

Spark also funds the Spark Give and Spark Volunteer programmes, which match employee charitable donations (up to a total pool of $250,000 per annual year) and provides all Spark people with one day leave a year to commit to volunteering.

Spark's subsidised broadband service Skinny Jump has been designed to operate on a not-for-profit basis - with the revenue generated covering the costs of the free modems, community partner network, product development, and customer care and education. The commercial value of the data provided to households in need through Skinny Jump totalled over $7.7 million in FY24.

# New Kiwis get connected online through Skinny Jump and New Zealand Red Cross

For many refugees who arrive in New Zealand, getting connected to the internet is vital for settling in a new country, learning a new language, and staying in touch with their families and friends. However, they often face barriers such as cost, language, and lack of knowledge about local processes.

That's why Spark Foundation and Digital Inclusion Alliance Aotearoa (DIAA) have partnered with New Zealand Red Cross to provide Awhi Matihiko, a digital inclusion programme that supports refugees to access and use the internet. Awhi Matihiko offers Skinny Jump, a low-cost wireless broadband service, as well as digital skills training and support.

Zakir Ahmed, Waheed Ahmed, and Amjad Mahmood are three refugees from Pakistan who arrived in Masterton in September 2023. They were assisted by the Red Cross team to get set up with

Awhi Matihiko and connected the modem in their home.

"When I arrived here, I was worried about how we would contact our families in Pakistan. Getting connected through Skinny Jump allows us to stay in contact with them and tell them what our lives are like in New Zealand," Waheed says.

Amjad adds: "It helps us learn English, and to prepare for the theory test for our driver licences."

Zakir agrees: "Without internet many things would be difficult, including speaking to people here and to our families. Having the internet is a plus point for us."

Through Awhi Matihiko, Zakir, Waheed, and Amjad are not only able to access the internet but also to develop their digital skills and confidence.

# Seniors Connect

In FY23, Spark held an event called ALL IN, which brought our people together to learn more about the digital divide and to work together on solutions. As part of the event, our people brainstormed ways to tackle digital equity, with close to 1,000 ideas generated.

These ideas were filtered down to ten concepts for Spark to explore, taking into consideration the feasibility and desirability of each idea. The idea that was chosen as the first to pursue posed the following question: "How might we enable Spark people to use their volunteer time to close the digital divide for seniors in New Zealand?"

This complements the work of Skinny Jump, which is focussed on cost as a barrier to connectivity, and Spark Foundation, which is focussed on Māori and Pacific youth. And with an ageing population here in Aotearoa, supporting digital equity for our senior New Zealanders is a logical area of focus for Spark.

To explore this idea further, we established a squad called 'Seniors Connect', who kicked things off by engaging with key community organisations across the country, to understand what problems seniors are facing when it comes to using digital technology, what services already exist in the community, and what Spark can do to meaningfully support seniors to thrive in an increasingly digital world.

The Seniors Connect Squad is now designing a service framework that will equip our retail store teams to support seniors effectively, while also connecting our customers to broader digital equity services across the community. We are also exploring how our people can utilise their volunteering days to support this work.

# Improving access and affordability through Skinny Jump

Skinny Jump is Spark's not-for-profit wireless broadband service for people who find cost a barrier to having an internet connection at home. The service is entirely prepaid, so there are no long-term contracts or credit checks needed, and all it takes to get set up is registering through a community partner and plugging in the modem.

Jump is delivered by a dedicated squad of Spark people alongside a community partner network, which is overseen by Digital Inclusion Alliance Aotearoa (DIAA) and includes nearly 300 local organisations nationwide, spanning community libraries and community hubs amongst others.

There are now over 31,776 households across the country who are actively using Skinny Jump.

For wireless broadband an active connection is defined as a customer having used their modem in the last 30 days. However, Skinny Jump customers are more likely to have infrequent internet use as they have to reprioritise their monthly spending when budgets are tight. This is why for Jump, we also measure customers who have used their modem in the last 90 days, and in FY24 this totalled more than 33,993 households.

Jump provides customers with 35GB of data for just  $5, with the first 15GB of data each month free. Customers can purchase up to six top-ups a month, which means Jump customers can access 225GB of data for just$ 30 a month.

In FY24 Skinny Jump continued its key partnerships, including the 'Ciena Jump for Students Fund', which gives eligible students a free Skinny Jump connection until the end of the school year. There are now 1,160 students using the Ciena Jump for Students Fund.

Skinny Jump also continued to support the 'Awhi Matihiko: Red Cross Digital Settlement Package' - a collaboration with New Zealand Red Cross, Internet NZ, and Digital Inclusion Alliance Aotearoa that gives new refugees a free Skinny Jump connection (for 12 months), a laptop, and digital skills training.

# Championing digital equity through Spark Foundation

Spark Foundation leads Spark's work in the community. The Foundation has a single-minded focus on digital equity, and its vision is that no New Zealander is left behind in a digital world. It has focussed its strategy on the areas it can make the biggest difference - digital access, digital skills and pathways, and digital wellbeing.

Spark Foundation allocates funding for programmes through a strategic partnership approach, working with organisations whose objectives are aligned to improving digital equity for Aotearoa. Most partnerships focus on empowering and equipping the next generation of digital thinkers and creators, especially Māori and youth, who are disproportionately impacted by digital exclusion.

Last year, Spark Foundation refreshed its strategic direction for the next three years, recognising the significant progress already made improving digital access through Skinny Jump and programmes such as Recycle A Device (RAD).

While the Foundation's three focus areas remain, over the coming years the focus on building digital skills and pathways into technology for Māori and Pasifika will be upweighted. We believe that equitable participation in our sector is the ultimate expression of digital equity.

# Spark Foundation investment

In FY24 Spark Foundation invested over $2 million into organisations and projects that accelerate digital equity. This includes funding received from Spark, in addition to proceeds from the sale of the Spark Foundation's art collection, which was completed in FY23. Around 80% of project funding supports nine multi-year partnerships, which span around two to five years. The rest is allocated to smaller, one-off grants.

During the year Spark Foundation launched a partner wellbeing initiative, Poipoia, in response to feedback from partners about mental health challenges their teams were experiencing.

As part of this initiative, Spark Foundation provided partners with funding to support wellbeing activities or resources for their people, as well as access to the 'Clearhead' app through Spark's own Mahi Tahi wellbeing programme. Clearhead offers a range of online tools in addition to six fully funded therapy sessions a year, to support mental health. Feedback from partners has been extremely positive and Poipoia will be continued in FY25.

# Te Ao Matihiko receives $1 million investment from Spark Foundation

In December, Spark Foundation announced a $1 million investment over the next three years in Te Ao Matihiko, the newly formed national organisation for Maori in technology, which launched in October.

Māori participation in the technology sector remains low, with the latest NZTech report 'Digital Skills for Tomorrow, Today' indicating only  $4.8\%$  of the sector identifies as Māori.

Te ao Matihiko has an ambitious vision to change this, by becoming the strategic backbone organisation for Māori in technology. It will do this by building a community of Māori in technology and pathways into the sector; raising visibility of Māori in the sector; strengthening and safeguarding Māori culture within digital spaces; and advocating for policy and system change.

The support provided by Spark Foundation will allow Te Ao Mathiiko to establish its Board and governance structures, create a longer-term 20-year roadmap, build operational capacity, and grow its membership base.

# Spark Foundation partnerships in FY24

# Digital access

Recycle A Device: Recycle A Device (RAD) takes second-hand laptops donated by businesses and households, teaches local akonga (students) to refurbish them, and then gets them into the hands of those who need them the most. The result is an end-to-end process of device collection, refurbishment, distribution, and disposal that enhances digital equity at every level - providing highly sought-after tools, access, and skills to rangatahi (young people) while also offering the added environmental benefit of diverting e-waste from landfill by giving these laptops a second life. Once devices have been refurbished, they are gifted to students within the school community itself or to other community organisations for distribution to people in need.

As well as Spark Foundation funding, Spark subsidiary Entelar Group partners with RAD to provide logistics support. In the last year, over 1,300 laptops were gifted to those in need, and RAD also ran 28 one-day workshops where over 420 rangatahi learned the tech engineering skills needed to repair laptops.

Porirua Access Connectivity and Education (PACE): Following a community talanoa in 2020 organised by Spark's Vaka Pasifika team, a community initiative, PACE, formed to specifically address the digital access, connectivity, and education divide in Porirua. In FY24, PACE ran a school-based community Wi-Fi pilot at three schools, which is now being rolled out to more schools across Porirua. PACE has also purchased devices that it is offering to families under a cost sharing model, which provides the option to split costs three ways between PACE, the school, and the family.

# Digital skills and pathways

Digital Natives Academy (DNA): DNA has been a Spark Foundation partner for nearly six years. A kaupapa Māori organisation, DNA Charitable Trust was established in 2014 to illuminate digital pathways and to inspire young people and their families to create, transform, shape, and develop their own digital tools. In April, 132 students came together to design the marae of the future for Te Ahi Orokohanga, a Minecraft Build event. In collaboration with Ngā Kura ā Iwi o Aotearoa, Local Gecko Productions, and Te Papatipu Matihiko Charitable Trust, DNA provided a culturally safe, empowering space for tamariki and rangatahi to explore the digital world and hosted and live-streamed the entire event in Te Reo Māori.

Fibre Fale: Founded by two young Pacific leaders, Julia Arnott-Neenee and Eteroa Lafaele, Fibre Fale creates pathways for Pacific people into the technology sector through education, advocacy, and facilitation. In FY24 Fibre Fale has focussed on showing up in places where their community is active, like social media. Here they have shared educational, relatable, and honest storytelling content. In June Nu'uali' Eteroa Lafaete was awarded joint Hi-Tech Young Achiever at the NZ Hi-Tech Awards.

P-Tech: A public education model designed by educators and the technology sector to address New Zealand's science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) skills gap. Participating schools collaborate with private companies that provide students with mentorships, worksite visits, and paid internships. On completing the programme, students will have both their National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA) qualifications and a New Zealand Diploma aligned to industry needs. In addition, successful graduates typically earn first-in-line consideration at affiliated industry partners when applying for jobs. In FY24 P-Tech recruited 120 students, bringing the total number of students to 350 across all five year levels of the programme.

# Pūhoro STEMM Academy: A kaupapa

Māori initiative that aims to improve representation of Māori in Science, Technology, Engineering, Maths, and Matauranga. Working with schools, Pūhoro supports iwi-affiliated rangatahi Māori from NCEA level 1 through to higher education, helping to guide them into high-value careers. Spark Foundation is a funder of the Hawke's Bay regional programme, which supports eight schools.

In FY24, Spark Foundation supported the aspirations of Pūhoro to double down on digital technology skills by providing further funding investment to support the new Kaiarataki Matihiko, digital tech lead role.

Hihiko Te Rawa Auahau: Delivered by Toi Kai Rawa, the Bay of Plenty's Māori economic development agency, Hihiko Te Rawa Auahau is focussed on delivering customised innovation plans to accelerate digital inclusion in the wider Bay of Plenty region, specifically tailored to the individual kura (schools) and communities they are working with. In FY24, Hihiko Te Rawa Auahau held three Hihiko STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts and maths) Innovation Days at Te Whare Wānanga o Awanuiārangi campus in Whakatāne. These events provided opportunities for akonga (students) to interact with a range of innovators from STEAM sectors across the region.

Take2: A programme that aims to break the cycle of crime through technology, Take2 teaches incarcerated individuals to code, enabling meaningful employment opportunities once they are released. Spark Foundation has supported Take2 for four years, with FY24 marking the final year of funding.

# Digital wellbeing

Digital Discipline: A programme that offers support to young people dealing with social media addiction through education, awareness, and strategies to balance the online world with the real world. Digital Discipline is currently focussed on South and West Auckland communities with further collaborations across the country. Spark Foundation has funded Digital Discipline for three years, with FY24 marking the final year of funding.

# Other partnerships and funding

In addition to multi-year partnerships, Spark Foundation also made smaller, one-off grants to a range of digital equity initiatives including The Light Project, Taiki E!, Maori Tech leaders wananga, Aquabots, Sticks 'n Stones, and Al Sandbox.

# SAGE Engineering club

SAGE Engineering Club is a group of five girls aged between 13-17 who qualified to represent New Zealand at the International SeaPerch Competition (underwater robotics) in May. The team participated in four different robotics and engineering competitions throughout the year and placed second in the High School Division at the New Zealand Aquabots Competition, which qualified them to represent New Zealand internationally. SAGE Engineering Club was the only all-girls team to qualify.

SAGE Engineering Club needed  $40,000 to make it to the international competition in the USA. In line with its mission to support youth who are disproportionately impacted by inequity to explore a future in technology, Spark Foundation contributed$ 5,000 to SAGE Engineering Club's Givealittle and rallied Spark people to donate. SAGE Engineering Club made it to the USA and ranked 17th out of 75 high school teams in the International SeaPerch Competition.

# Connecting our people to our communities

Spark encourages our people to give back to the community through our Spark Give and Spark Volunteer programmes.

# Spark Give

Our payroll giving programme, Spark Give, enables our people to donate to schools and charities via their pay. Spark matches donations towards our four key partners through Spark Give dollar-for-dollar (up to a cap of $250,000 per year).

Our people also have the option to donate to their personal causes, and Spark continued to match most registered charities (except schools and religious organisations) dollar-for-dollar (up to $500 per person per year, up to a total of $50,000 per year).

In FY24 Spark Give donations included:  

<table><tr><td>Employee Donations:</td><td>$307,497
(FY23: $366,431)</td></tr><tr><td>Spark&#x27;s Matching:</td><td>$47,622
(FY23: $59,239)</td></tr><tr><td>Number of employees participating:</td><td>342
(FY23: 205)</td></tr></table>

# Spark Volunteer

Spark employees can take one volunteer day each year, for skills or mission-based volunteering. Skill-based volunteering means our people focus on opportunities to use their specialised skills and talents to assist not-for-profits. Mission-based volunteering means volunteering with organisations whose work aligns with digital equity.

Some of the organisations that our people volunteered for over the year include Pride, Lifeline, Sustainable Coastlines, Summer of Tech, Shadow Tech, Hatch, GirlBoss NZ, P-Tech, Trees that Count, and Take2.

In FY24 volunteer leave days were as follows:  

<table><tr><td>Total staff eligible for volunteering:</td><td>5,291
(FY23: 4,259)</td></tr><tr><td>Total employee participation:</td><td>610 days by 633 people
(FY23: 462 days)</td></tr><tr><td>% of employee participation:</td><td>12%
(FY23: 11%)</td></tr></table>

# OUTCOMES

High performing, engaged, and inclusive teams

Our success relies on our team of talented and diverse people. A career at Spark offers opportunities to learn, grow, and belong to a business that encourages leading-edge learning and development, holistic wellbeing support and services, and the chance to be part of a high-performing team that operates in an inclusive agile environment, that can unlock innovation.

![](images/8f54810d5ce8c8cf20d8d8924305e86baa50042652d9c126879c37ecc5f4de87.jpg)

# Employee engagement

We measure the engagement of our people using regular, confidential surveys and pulse checks that provide us with a comprehensive engagement assessment that reflects employee motivation, likelihood to remain with Spark, and how likely our people are to recommend Spark as an employer.

Feedback from these surveys is shared with our people, with improvement actions then co-created within teams to improve our ways of working and culture. As a business, this has led to a number of improvements over the last year, such as changes to our annual remuneration review, our Quarterly Business Review (QBR) processes, and the development of a new management development programme.

Participation in our surveys has remained strong, with  $86\%$  of our people taking part in our final FY24 survey, which ensures we have high quality and reliable insights to take action on.

In this end of year survey, our people engagement score was  $67\%$ , which is above the New Zealand median for large companies, but down  $3\%$  from a year ago. While we had tracked as high as  $71\%$  during FY24, our end of year survey was conducted after we made a range of changes across different teams, to align our operating model to our new strategy, and respond to challenging market conditions. Understandably, these organisational changes had an impact on how our people were feeling in those areas of the business. We remain focussed on our ambition to achieve top decile engagement by FY26.

# 67%

The survey also showed that  $80\%$  of our people are proud to work for Spark and  $84\%$  feel comfortable bringing their whole selves to work, which indicates our inclusion initiatives continue to resonate with our people, and we are an employer who differentiates based on our culture and employee engagement.

# Establishing our new skilling centre - Te Awe

As the pace of technological advancement continues to accelerate, it is critical to upskill, reskill, and cross-skill our people to prepare for a future of work that is 'already here'.

Te Awe was created in response to the surge in demand for skills in new technologies, such as AI, data and analytics, and cloud. It is a skills acceleration programme within Spark that is building the 'hard to access' specialist digital skills we need to support our strategic ambitions.

'Te Awe' comes from the te reo Māori word, 'awe' - which refers to the white feathers of an albatross that are traditionally used to adorn kākahu (clothing), korowai (cloaks), and makawe (hair). In te ao Māori, the adornment of feathers symbolises strength, power, and influence, and in Pasifika cultures, feathers are also used to adorn fine mats to enhance value. So, the name Te Awe was chosen as a nod to Spark's commitment to Te Tiriti and our strategic ambition to increase Māori and Pasifika participation at Spark by 5 percentage points by the end of FY26.

During FY24 we kicked off our first two programmes in data analytics & visualisation and Generative AI, with 200 people progressing through this training.

As a company with a long-standing commitment to digital equity, we also want to ensure that the skills shift we are experiencing does not further entrench existing inequities within our sector and our society.

Our plan is to explore how we can now work with key partners to potentially open Te Awe up to broader community interest, to ensure we are intentionally growing a more inclusive high-tech workforce pipeline for the future.

# Innovation culture

A key pillar of SPK-26 is creating an Innovation Culture that will fuel our future growth ambitions and differentiate Spark through top decile people engagement.

As part of this, we will continue to evolve our ways of working, invest in strategic skill development, attract, develop, and retain a diverse pipeline of future talent and use data and insights to co-create inclusive and differentiated employee experiences.

# Investing in strategic skill development

Continuous learning and building skills and capabilities that enable innovation is a core focus of how we develop our people at Spark. We want to enable personal growth and adaptability, so our people are clear on what our customers want and need, are open to diverse ideas and perspectives, can adapt at pace, and sustain high performance.

We enable this through quality coaching, leading-edge learning and development programmes and with a deliberate focus on progressing our own people through new roles and learning experiences across our organisation.

# Spark Cloud Academy

In FY24, we teamed up with one of our partners, AWS, to launch the Spark Cloud Academy - to upskill our people working in our cloud business and deepen their knowledge and understanding of cloud services and solutions. The cloud market is a key focus area for Spark, and this training offers our teams the opportunity to become cloud experts and better support our customers to find the best mix of different cloud solutions that match their needs.

# Leadership development

We continued to deliver our flagship Agile Leaders Programme (ALP), which supports our ambition to create an Innovation Culture at Spark, underpinned by high performance leadership skills and experiences. The programme is a significant investment in our key talent and runs over six months, with a focus on building the environments for people to thrive, innovate through design thinking, use leadership empathy for connection and belonging, and coach for sustainable high performance.

In FY24, a total of 38 leaders participated in the programme, with  $67\%$  of ALP alumni having progressed to other roles or expanded the scopes of their roles within Spark.

"For all of our leadership programmes we aim to meet our 40:40:20 gender commitments in addition to ensuring a diverse mix of people are participating when considering ethnicity, business unit, role, and stage in career."

In June we launched a new programme called Leadership Essentials. This has been designed to deliver consistent learning and development that unlocks the potential growth and movement of our leaders at the layer below Spark's Wider Leadership Group. It is focussed on resetting our standards for leadership across key capability growth areas, in alignment with our three-year strategy and both identifying and further investing in the development of top talent from this group. We are redirecting some of our prior investment in ALP to this important programme, to further accelerate performance and results. Our pilot cohort was launched in June 2024, and we have a roadmap for delivering further cohorts this calendar year, formed from new and existing leaders across the business who are committed to developing their own and their team members' skills and learning. Our ambition is to ensure all our middle-layer leaders attend the programme over time.

For all of our leadership programmes we aim to meet our 40:40:20 gender commitments in addition to ensuring a diverse mix of people are participating when considering ethnicity, business unit, role, and stage in career.

# Compliance and mandatory training

There is a requirement for all our employees and contractors to complete mandatory e-learning modules when they commence working at Spark. These learning modules ensure proficiency in core foundational areas, such as health and safety, legal, privacy, decision-making, reporting, and security.

Completion of these modules is monitored by people leaders and reported more formally on a quarterly basis. We use regular reporting to ensure there is ongoing visibility of completion for all our people.

As part of our ISO27001 accreditation there are additional modules required for completion prior to gaining access to systems and sensitive information, to maintain high quality standards when dealing with information, customer data, and security. These are closely monitored and audited to ensure compliance and the necessary governance. We undertake recertification every three years for ISO 27001, with the last certification issued in July 2023. Further surveillance audits are undertaken each year to ensure a high level of compliance.

# Health, safety, and wellbeing

# Mahi Tahi - wellbeing

Wellbeing continues to remain a clear priority and focus at Spark, with Mahi Tahi, Spark's wellbeing programme, being a key component of our ways of working and Health, Safety, and Wellbeing system.

Mahi Tahi works in partnership with our people to support their goals at work and in life. The four pillars of the Mahi Tahi framework are closely aligned with Te Whare Tapa Wha (the four cornerstones of Māori health):

1. Healthy work environment - providing our people with a place to work that looks after more than just physical safety but also mental and social wellbeing  
2. Connection, collaboration, and community - ensuring we have meaningful activities in place so our people can foster strong connections with those they work with and care about  
3. Mind health - supporting strong mental health capacity and confidence and fostering a growth mindset  
4. Energy - building a culture where we help our people keep their batteries charged, so they can perform at their best

As part of our Mahi Tahi offering, we have an online Wellbeing Hub that includes opportunities for our people to book sessions with our Spark-certified Mahi Tahi coaches, access support through our employee assistance provider (EAP), or book a one-on-one appointment with one of our qualified psychologists, who we have partnered with directly to provide specialist care to our people in critical need. To really integrate Mahi Tahi into our core business practices, our People and Culture partners work closely with our senior leaders to incorporate wellbeing objectives and KPIs into their quarterly planning.

During FY24 we launched a new partnership with Clearhead to facilitate our EAP services and offering. Clearhead is an app-based assistance service that gives our people access to knowledge and tools to support them with their mental wellbeing, as well as the ability to book six fully funded therapy sessions annually with trained psychologists and counsellors. This new partnership was a result of feedback from our people who told us that although our previous EAP was useful, many of our people were experiencing long wait times for professional help. Over 1,500 (28%) of our people have registered to use the service in the last year.

# 88%

of our people believe that their people leader genuinely cares about their wellbeing.

Our culture survey showed that  $88\%$  of our people believe that their people leader genuinely cares about their wellbeing and  $78\%$  of our people say that when they are unwell, they take the time off they need to recover.

Our people have also told us that anxiety is an important issue, so we have continued our partnership with Take a Breath - a breathing app designed to reduce stress and anxiety. Nearly half of our people have used this app so far, noting it has helped them to combat anxiety and improve their sleep.  $10\%$  of our people have also gifted the app to their friends and whānau.

A foundation of our Mahi Tahi programme are our Mahi Tahi coaches, with 20 additional coaches trained in FY24, bringing our total to 40 internally accredited wellbeing peer coaches. Our coaches, who are trained and supervised by our qualified psychologists, act as first-line support to our people when they're working day to day. This includes supporting leaders, teams, or individuals to help them with their energy, focus, or finding ways to seek different support options. In FY24, our Mahi Tahi coaches completed over 215 coaching sessions with Spark people.

In November 2023, Spark was awarded the 'New Horizon' award for an innovative approach to wellbeing, at the Southern Cross Wayfinder Awards, which celebrate leadership in workplace wellbeing.

# Health, Safety, and Wellbeing System at Spark

Spark has a well-established health and safety management system, focussed on continuous improvement. Our Health, Safety, and Wellbeing Strategy is built around four pillars:

- Strategy and framework - a strong health and safety management framework providing a platform for success  
- Hazard and risk management
  - proactive 'owners' approach to health and safety and the management of critical hazards and associated risks  
- Leadership and ownership - a culture of empowerment at every level  
Resources and supporting activity - a commitment by the business to ensuring the resources and capabilities are in place to deliver the health and safety strategy

Our system covers all of Sparks workers (employees and contractors) and workplaces, and aligns to the requirements of the health and safety at work act (2015) and other legal and regulatory requirements. During FY24 no Spark employee or contractor suffered serious injury or death over the year. Our TRIFR (Total Recordable Incident Frequency Rate) increased to 3.5 primarily due to an increase in the number of recordable soft tissue injuries. No notifiable events were reported under current New Zealand health and safety legislation, and Spark received no health and safety prosecutions or notices issued by WorkSafe.

Based on the experiences of the last few years, our planning and response activities now incorporate lessons from the pandemic and the impact severe weather events had on our people and places across New Zealand. We are always looking

for continuous improvement in our practices based on what is happening in society and organisational environments. We continue to follow a risk-based approach for our activities and work collaboratively across the business to ensure we have the right response and resources in place to support emergency preparedness.

In FY24 we continued to work with our Wider Leadership Group to foster health and safety employee empowerment and participation as part of our Tribe, Unit, and Centre of Excellence (CoE) meetings and routine events. We continued our work with our wholly owned subsidiaries to identify the areas of greatest priority to support the development, application, and monitoring of a health and safety continuous improvement framework.

# Diversity, equity, and inclusion

Our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion is embedded into our day-to-day activities, standards, and business practices. It is a strategic business priority and key enabler of our performance and culture.

Our focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion, including our Blue Heart kaupapa, has helped us create an environment where our people feel comfortable bringing their whole selves to work, regardless of gender, ethnicity, orientation, age, experience, neurodivergence, or ability.

# Spark's Blue Heart kaupapa in action

Our Blue Heart kaupapa sets the standards of behaviour, alongside our values, to foster a culture of connection and belonging. It is a visible icon of our heart-led approach to diversity and inclusion.

Blue Heart cultural celebrations and events remain an important part of bringing our people together and in FY24 we celebrated key moments, such as International Women's Day, Lunar New Year, Diwali, and Matariki events at our offices throughout the country.

During FY24, we also held our very first 'bring your Tamariki to work day' at Spark City in Auckland, where our people were invited to bring their children to work to experience a range of fun activities and digital experiences.

# Te Korowai Tupu

Our Māori strategy, Te Korowai Tupu (the cloak of growth), is a pillar of our SPK-26 strategy and applies a tangata whenua worldview across our strategies, actions, and values within Kora Aotearoa, also known as Spark New Zealand. Our kaiārahi (Māori ambassadors) provide guidance and support to ensure a kaupapa Māori-led delivery of the strategy throughout the business.

In FY24, we continued to embed both te reo Māori and tikanga Māori into our everyday practices to achieve a better understanding of our indigenous culture. This included te reo lessons (for beginners and intermediate levels) with either online or classroom options, tikanga learning and development programmes for leaders, and Te Tiriti o Waitangi workshops. Our cultural intelligence Māori app Tuia te Ao provides a tool for our people to use to kick-start their learning journey, and includes important aspects of te reo Māori me ona tikanga. In the last year over 300 of our people chose to participate in one of the options available.

Key partnerships continue to enable us to deliver on our Te Korowai Tupu aspirations, including Te Wananga o Aotearoa, Whāriki, Kiwa Digital, Education Perfect, and Te Pūtahitanga o te Waipounamu.

In June, we also celebrated Matariki across our corporate offices, with a range of activities, including performances, demonstrations, and lots of kai (food).

# Vaka Pasifika

Vaka Pasifika is Spark's Pacific Canoe - a community of the  $5 \%$ of Spark people who identify as Pasifika, formed in 2017 with a mission to empower, grow, and build the capability of Pasifika peoples at Spark.

During FY24 the Vaka Pasifika group continued to promote its strategy 'Folaugamo Taeao - A Journey to Tomorrow', to the business through engagement with senior leaders and people leaders.

The strategy sets out three key pillars over the next horizon to grow and support Pasifika aspirations at Spark, including growing the capability and leadership skills of the Vaka Pasifika team, growing Spark's cultural knowledge, and enabling Spark to become an industry champion for Pasifika.

# Pride

Spark has been a long-time supporter of the rainbow community. In FY24 we celebrated Pride at Spark by launching a Blue Heart Pride pin (that was designed by one of our people) for our people to purchase, with proceeds from the sales donated to OutLine Aotearoa. We also held Pride celebrations across our offices around the country, including Drag Bingo events in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch.

After consultation with Spark's Rainbow Committee during FY24, we want to upweight our focus on internal initiatives in FY25, to find more ways to support our rainbow community to feel a sense of belonging at Spark. With that ambition in mind, in June we launched our 'Allyship at Spark' programme - inviting our people to make a pledge to become an ally of the LGBTQIA+ community and help us foster a more inclusive environment at Spark. Everyone who makes the pledge receives a special Spark rainbow lanyard as a visual symbol of support for our rainbow community.

Over the last year, we have also continued to rollout our new email signatures, which enable our people to display their preferred pronouns.

These initiatives, led by our Spark Pride Committee, aim to recognise, nurture, and enhance belonging and connection throughout Spark for our LGBTQIA+ community.

# Our diversity performance

We believe in the idea that what gets measured matters and gets done. We take a data and insight-led approach to improving and delivering our diversity and inclusion practices and ambitions. Having a greater understanding of who we are will allow us to create experiences and provide support that is tailored to the diverse needs of our people.

# Improving female representation

Over the past year we have continued to focus on improving female representation across the Group and achieving our ambition of 40:40:20 representation Spark-wide, which refers to  $40\%$  men,  $40\%$  women, and  $20\%$  of any gender (as well as gender diverse representatives).

We have not been able to achieve this ambition at a Group-wide level in FY24, with female representation remaining flat at  $34\%$ . Within the core Spark business, female representation is higher at  $37\%$ , while in our wholly owned subsidiaries (CCL, MATTR, Digital Island, and Entelar Group) representation is significantly lower at  $22\%$ .

This is reflective of what is an industry-wide challenge, particularly within some of our subsidiaries' sectors, and requires long term focus and action to continue to challenge the status quo and create change. We continue to work actively alongside our industry peers, external technology institutions, and other thought leaders to create meaningful opportunities for a New Zealand-wide pipeline of women in technology careers.

We remain committed to our 40:40:20 target as part of our SPK-26 strategy and will continue to report progress on this annually to our stakeholders and through our membership of Champions for Change.

Our People & Culture Partners continued to support our senior leaders across the business by providing resources, standards and guidelines, and data insights that help them to hire talented candidates with diversity in mind and track their progress against their goals and our Spark-wide ambitions. Each area has an action plan to

achieve its representation goals in addition to maintaining recruitment standards such as 40:40:20 shortlists.

Within our Leadership Squad and Wider Leadership Group (senior roles outside Board and Leadership Squad), we maintained 40:40:20 representation, which is fundamental to reaching our broader diversity ambitions.

Our Board is  $63\%$  female and  $37\%$  male, with five female directors (including our CEO) and three male directors. One new female Director joined our Board in May, and one male Director retired at the Annual General Meeting in November.

For FY24, our Leadership Squad was  $55\%$  female and  $45\%$  male. At the end of FY24 one female leader resigned from our Leadership Squad, taking the female-to-male ratio to a  $50\%$  female and  $50\%$  male split for FY25.

# Reducing our gender pay gap

Our ambition is to reduce our median gender pay gap by 10 percentage points from FY21 to  $18\%$  by the end of FY25. Our median gender pay gap for FY24 is unchanged from FY23 at  $22\%$ , but we did see improvement in our mean (average) gender pay gap from  $13\%$  to  $12\%$ . Achieving our pay gap ambitions is closely linked to our approach to improving female representation and progression in specialist skilled areas and roles, as outlined above.

Our Diversity and Inclusion Policy sets out our framework in this area: www.spark.co.nz/online/about/ourcompany/governance

# Improving ethnic representation across Spark

Diversity does not start and end with gender and we have increased our focus on ethnic diversity over the last few years. We achieved our ambition to capture the ethnicity data of  $80\%$  of our core Spark employees last year from a baseline of  $19\%$ . This year we focussed on capturing this data for our wider group, including Entelar, CCL, and MATTR. We were pleased to achieve a Group-wide figure of  $78\%$  by the end of FY24, with only Digital Island now excluded from this data set.

As at 30 June 2024, the available data on our people shows that  $47\%$  come from New Zealand European or European ethnic backgrounds;  $37\%$  report a diverse range of Asian ethnicities, with the largest groups being Indian (15% overall), Southeast Asian (8%), and Chinese (7%);  $4\%$  of our people are Māori; and  $5\%$  report Pacific ethnicities, most commonly Samoan (2%). A higher

proportion of people from New Zealand European or European ethnicities are in leadership roles at Spark (including the Leadership Squad and Wider Leadership Group) at  $79\%$ , down slightly from  $84\%$  in FY23.

In FY24 we have continued our focus on attracting, retaining, and progressing a diverse range of people across our organisation, as well as sustaining an inclusive culture. As part of SPK-26 we have an ambition to lift Māori and Pasifika representation by a combined 5 percentage points by FY26. In FY24 we have held flat, with Māori and Pasifika representing  $9\%$  of our workforce. This remains a continued focus in the years ahead, and through our new internal skilling centre, Te Awe, and existing partnerships we plan to engage a diverse pipeline of future talent to be upskilled and reskilled for roles within Spark or the technology sector more broadly.

# 78%

The percentage of Spark people sharing their ethnicity data with us.

Percentage based on permanent and fixed-term employees at Spark; employees as of 30 June 2024 who had provided ethnicity data (n=4015). NZ European/European includes all European ethnicities (e.g. British, German) and Australian European. Excludes employees in Digital Island. Spark collects information on main and other ethnicity where an individual identifies with more than one ethnicity. Consistent with the Champions for Change methodology, where an individual reports more than one ethnicity these are represented equally (e.g. two ethnicities represented as 0.5 each).

"Spark provides a parental leave policy for eligible employees, regardless of gender, sexuality, age or whether the employee is giving birth or adopting a child."

# Parental leave

Spark provides a parental leave policy for eligible employees, regardless of gender, sexuality, age or whether the employee is giving birth or adopting a child.

As part of our parental offering, Whakapuawai, Spark tops-up the Government's parental leave contributions so that primary carers receive  $100\%$  of their normal salary for 26 weeks, with continued employer KiwiSaver contributions of  $3\%$  during their parental leave period.

![](images/ca937f5f5731b4e6365e65ad993de20be2b6207a877005c06cae2870c978c18a.jpg)

![](images/0f512e0370ccb3f5c7f14d1fffaa2608a027fdd39c9c2e6aade8ab82260b68f8.jpg)

Secondary carers also receive four weeks' paid leave (increased from two), so they can be present to support their partner and whānau during those pivotal first few weeks of their baby's life.

The package also includes a phased return to work policy for primary carers, who can work  $80\%$  of their regular hours on  $100\%$  salary for the first three months of their return.

Eligibility for Parental Leave is in accordance with government legislation.

In FY24 we had 139 employees take parental leave, with  $88\%$  of parents due to return to work in FY24 coming back and  $62\%$  of returners in FY23 remaining with us for 12 months or more, up from  $56\%$  in FY23.

Chair of the HRCC

# A note from Alison Barrass, Chair of the HRCC

# Tena koutou,

As the Chair of the Human Resources and Compensation Committee (HRCC), I am pleased to present Spark's Remuneration Report for FY24.

This year we have consolidated relevant annual report information into a single remuneration report, which outlines our commitment to transparent and equitable remuneration practices that align with our strategic objectives and foster a high-performance culture.

Throughout the year, the HRCC has reviewed and refined our remuneration framework and practices to ensure they remain competitive and fair, supporting the attraction, retention, and motivation of our talented workforce. Our approach is underpinned by robust governance and benchmarking against industry standards, ensuring that our policies reflect both market conditions and the long-term interests of our shareholders.

At Spark, we seek to remunerate our people with competitive salaries, so we can recruit and retain the best talent. In keeping with our focus on customer experience, we incorporate customer satisfaction measures alongside EBITDAI and key strategic initiatives into our short- term incentive (STI) measures each year.

Key highlights of our remuneration activities this year include:

- A focus on fair pay: as part of our FY24 Salary Review we ensured that we delivered higher than inflation adjustments to our lowest paid employees taking into consideration benchmarks such as the voluntary Living Wage standard, and that individuals earning less than $100,000 were a focus at this time, due to inflationary pressures in the market.  
- A rejuvenated Spark Share approach: we endorsed a new partnership with Sharesies which delivered our largest employee Share Scheme participation since inception, with 1,200 participants and nearly 1,000,000 shares issued.  
- Inclusion of ESG measures in incentives: we included environmental and diversity goals in our long-term incentive (LTI) for the second year running in FY24, and will see these continue in the FY25 LTI grant. I am proud that Spark is one of the first companies in New Zealand to link its LTI to its sustainability ambitions.

Looking ahead, the HRCC will continue to evaluate and enhance our remuneration practices, ensuring they remain fit for purpose in a dynamic and challenging business and talent environment. We are committed to maintaining a remuneration framework that not only rewards individual and collective success but also upholds our values and drives sustainable growth.

I would like to extend my gratitude to all our employees for their dedication and contributions over the past year. Together, we will continue to build a thriving and inclusive workplace where everyone can achieve their best.

Thank you for your continued support.

Ngā mihi nui,

# Remuneration at Spark

Spark remunerates our people with salaries in line with the market, alongside consideration of performance, scope, skills, and experience, to recruit and retain the best talent.

We have an annual salary review process for all eligible permanent employees. For most employees this is based on our Contribution Model, which considers employee development in their 'craft', as well as the application of people skills, customer focus, and commercial acumen. The aim is to ensure progression is transparent, with a five-step career ladder from beginner to expert and clearly defined competencies to progress against. Salary ranges for steps are benchmarked against the New Zealand market.

In February 2024, the Board approved a salary review allocation for FY25 (salaries from 1 July 2024), which was based on our Contribution Models with additional allocations, including higher increases for our lowest paid employees, taking into consideration factors such as inflation and the (voluntary) Living Wage benchmark. As part of this process, we also reviewed some salary ranges to ensure that they were competitive against the market.

# Fixed remuneration

All Spark employee packages include a fixed remuneration component that is set based on contribution, experience, and market relativities. Fixed remuneration consists of base salary. KiwiSaver sits outside fixed remuneration and as such, employees with KiwiSaver receive employer contributions on top of base salary and cash incentives. A number of Spark-funded benefits, including medical and life insurances, are also available to eligible employees on top of fixed remuneration.

# Short-term incentive schemes

Spark operates a small number of short-term incentive schemes, from monthly and quarterly commission and sales incentive plans to annual cash-based short-term incentives. Some employees in specific sales positions may have a component of their remuneration subject to individual or divisional sales performance targets, such that their total remuneration potential is directly linked to the acquisition and retention of profitable business for Spark.

For senior leaders, including the Leadership Squad, a component of their remuneration package is at risk in the form of a discretionary annual cash-based Short-Term Incentive (STI). Spark's STI scheme rewards senior leaders for the achievement of annual performance objectives, with payments awarded from a fixed cash pool that is set based on overall Spark performance against financial and/or non-financial annual performance objectives. The actual payment to individuals is at the sole discretion of Spark and takes into account contributing factors such as performance and the performance of individual parts of the business.

Eligibility to participate in the STI scheme on an annual basis is at the discretion of the company and is targeted at individuals in senior roles who play a significant role in driving the overall performance of Spark.

The STI scheme rules contain a clawback provision that allows Spark to clawback any payments made under the STI scheme, for a period of 12 months following the payment.

# FY24 short-term incentive scheme outcomes

For FY24, substantively all STI participants shared the same Spark Group targets comprising of EBITDAI, customer experience measures, as well as additional measures based on our three-year strategy. The on-target percentages are provided in the table below. Where the result of a performance metric falls below a specified threshold, there is no payment for that proportion of the STI. Where results exceed the target, the payment can scale to up to twice the target percentage with a maximum overall payment of  $200\%$ .

The FY24 Group performance outcome, as approved by the Board, is summarised in the table below.

<table><tr><td>Performance metric</td><td>%</td><td>Target</td><td>Outcome</td><td>Result</td></tr><tr><td>Group EBITDAI</td><td>50%</td><td>$1,245m</td><td>0%</td><td>Did not meet threshold</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Customer experience - iNPS and digital journey completion rate (JCR)</td><td>25%</td><td>+37 (iNPS)</td><td>28%</td><td>Exceeded target (iNPS)Achieved threshold (JCR)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>55% (JCR)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>High tech revenue (MATTR, Qrious, IoT, Spark Health)</td><td>25%</td><td>$196m</td><td>0%</td><td>Did not meet threshold</td></tr><tr><td>Total payment</td><td>100%</td><td></td><td>0%</td><td>No payment through STI scheme as EBITDAI threshold was not met</td></tr></table>

As the EBITDAI threshold was not met for FY24, no payments were approved for Spark STI this year.

# FY25 short-term incentive scheme target

The mechanics of the FY25 STI will be the same as those for FY24. Group results will be the main determinate of the STI pool, with substantively all participants sharing the same Group measures. The FY25 Group measures will be a combination of EBITDAI, customer experience, and our three-year strategy.

<table><tr><td>Measure</td><td>Weighting</td></tr><tr><td>EBITDAI</td><td>50%</td></tr><tr><td>Customer experience (iNPS and digital)</td><td>30%</td></tr><tr><td>Digital infrastructure</td><td>20%</td></tr></table>

# Long-term incentive schemes

Spark believes that some senior leaders should have part of their remuneration linked to the long-term performance of the Company, so for the Leadership Squad and a select group of senior leaders, a long-term incentive forms part of their remuneration package. Spark's long-term incentive targets focus on total shareholder return as well as environment and social governance targets. In FY24, Spark operated one main scheme: the Spark New Zealand Long Term Incentive Scheme.

# FY21 long-term incentive outcome

The FY21 long-term grant, issued in 2020, did not vest in FY24 (2023) as the absolute Total Shareholder Return hurdle was not achieved.

<table><tr><td>Grant year</td><td>Securities</td><td>Performance period</td><td>Performance measure</td><td>Vesting outcome</td></tr><tr><td>FY21</td><td>Options</td><td>September 2020 
– September 2023</td><td>Absolute Total Shareholder Return (TSR), hurdle - Spark&#x27;s annual cost of equity + 1% compounding</td><td>100% lapsed - 3 year TSR result was 20.35% compared with a 31.60% target</td></tr></table>

# FY24 long-term incentive scheme performance measures

For FY24 members of the Leadership Squad (including the CEO) and selected senior leaders were granted options under the Spark Long-Term Incentive Scheme (LTI). Under the scheme, participants were granted options at the start of the three-year vesting period. The number of options granted equalled the gross LTI value divided by the volume weighted average price of Spark New Zealand shares for the 20 days prior to the grant date. Subject to satisfaction of each performance hurdle and continued employment, at vesting the portion of options associated with each achieved target convert to Spark shares based on a zero exercise price. Where a target is not met the associated portion of options simply lapse.

Vesting of the FY24 LTI grant (September 2023) is contingent on participants' continued employment with Spark through to September 2026 with vesting depending on meeting or exceeding set performance measures.  $75\%$  of the allocated shares will vest based on aTSR exceeding cost of equity  $+1.5\%$  (compounding annually) over the vesting period and  $25\%$  will vest based on performance against environmental and diversity targets. aTSR is a measure of share price appreciation and dividends paid over the three-year period of the grant.

<table><tr><td>Measure</td><td>Target</td><td>Weighting</td></tr><tr><td>Absolute Total Shareholder Return</td><td>Cost of equity + 1.5% compounding</td><td>75%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Scope 1-3 Emissions</td><td>Reduce absolute scope 1 and scope 2 GHG emissions by at least 33.6% against baseline GHG performance.</td><td rowspan="2">12.5%</td></tr><tr><td>Scope 3 - at least 70% of suppliers by spend have established supplier science-based targets.</td></tr><tr><td>Gender pay gap (median)</td><td>Reducing gender pay gap by six percentage points to 16%</td><td>12.5%</td></tr></table>

# FY25 long-term incentive scheme

For FY25, members of the Leadership Squad, including the CEO, and selected senior leaders will be granted options under a similar scheme as FY24 with performance measures relating to Spark's ESG performance alongside an absolute Total Shareholder Return (aTSR) performance hurdle.

# Employee remuneration

The table below shows the number of employees and former employees, not being directors of Spark, who, in their capacity as employees, received remuneration and other benefits during FY24 totalling NZ$100,000 or more<sup>1</sup>.

1. The table includes base salaries, short-term incentives and vested long-term incentives. The table does not include: amounts paid after 30 June 2024 relating to FY24; long-term incentives that have been granted and have yet to vest (based on grant values, the total value of which was NZ$12.8 million as at 30 June 2024); product and service concessions received by employees; contributions paid towards health and other insurances; and contributions paid to the Government Superannuation Fund (a legacy benefit provided to a small number of employees). As a result of organisational changes in FY24 a significant number of employees with base salaries under $100,000 appear in this table due to redundancy payments.

# Leadership Squad remuneration

All Leadership Squad packages include a fixed remuneration component that is set based on contribution, experience, and market relativities. Fixed remuneration supports the attraction, motivation, and retention of highly skilled executives. Fixed remuneration consists of base salary.

A component of each executive's remuneration package is at risk in the form of a discretionary annual cash-based STI. Spark's STI scheme rewards executives for the achievement of annual performance objectives, which vary from year to year.

Executives are also granted options annually under the Spark LTI scheme. Under that scheme, participants are granted options at the start of a three-year vesting period with vesting subject to a performance hurdle or hurdles.

# Remuneration mix

The table below shows the standard FY25 remuneration mix for the Leadership Squad expressed as a percentage of fixed remuneration. The Short-Term Incentive (STI) scheme is expressed at target, with payment range from no payment, where no target thresholds are met to a maximum payment of double the target value, where all stretch targets are met. The Long-Term Incentive scheme (LTI) values represent the maximum LTI value.

Leadership Squad remuneration

1. Excludes benefits offered to some subsidiaries, which differ from Spark's overall benefits suite.  
2. Eligibility for Parental Leave is in accordance with government legislation.  
3. Employees must work at least 15 hours a week to be eligible.  
4. Employees with active Spark mobile or broadband accounts will receive monthly credits of $120, which can be used towards Spark products or services.  
5. Spark's employee share purchase scheme provides a simple and cost effective way for Spark NZ employees to acquire discounted shares through an interest free loan paid off over three years, giving employees a real stake in the future success of the company.  
6. The opportunity for Spark employees to take a day of paid volunteer leave.  
7. For specific charities, Spark will match employee donations dollar-for-dollar, up to a $500 annual matching cap.  
8. Casual employees are ineligible.  
9. Marram Trust offers access to accommodation across New Zealand for discounted rates, as well as providing a basic level of healthcare cover.  
10. The ability to purchase additional annual leave via a deduction of base salary.  
11. Wellbeing support includes access to Clearhead including funded therapy sessions, specialist clinical support from our in-house psychotherapist and health psychologist, and subscription to the Take A Breath Platform.

# Performance evaluation

The CEO annually reviews the performance of her direct reports. The evaluation is undertaken using criteria set by the CEO, including the performance of the business, the accomplishment of strategic and operational objectives, and other non-quantitative objectives agreed with the HRCC at the beginning of each financial year. The last Leadership Squad evaluations were undertaken during June 2024. Spark undertakes appropriate checks before appointing someone onto the Leadership Squad.

# CEO remuneration

# Remuneration policy, strategy, and governance

CEO Jolie Hodson's remuneration package reflects the scope, risk, and complexity of her role and is set by the Board with reference to the remuneration of CEOs of similarly sized organisations. The Board reviewed the CEO remuneration package and it remains unchanged at 1 July 2024.

# CEO remuneration FY24

For FY24 the CEO's remuneration package comprised a fixed cash component, an at-risk short-term incentive, and an at-risk long-term incentive, to be awarded under the Spark Long-Term Incentive Scheme. The targets and operation of the CEO's STI and LTI is the same as described under Short-term incentive schemes and Long-term incentive scheme at pages 75 - 76. The construct of the CEO's remuneration package is such that  $60\%$  of her remuneration package is at risk. The table below shows the target remuneration mix:

<table><tr><td>Long-term incentive</td><td>75% of base</td></tr><tr><td>Short-term incentive</td><td>75% of base</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>Base</td></tr></table>

The CEO is also expected to maintain a holding of Spark shares as set out on page 80 of this report.

# Remuneration components

# Short-term incentive scheme

The CEO is eligible for an annual cash-based short-term incentive, subject to the achievement of specific performance objectives set by the Board based on Spark's strategy and business plan for the respective financial year. These objectives will be a combination of financial and non-financial measures. This is covered in more detail in the earlier STI scheme section. The Board assesses the CEO's performance at the end of the financial year to determine the actual payment value of her short-term incentive, which is in the range of  $0\%$  to  $200\%$  of her target value.

The FY24 Group performance outcome, as approved by the Board and applicable to the CEO, is summarised as follows:  

<table><tr><td>Performance metric</td><td>%</td><td>Target</td><td>Outcome</td><td>Result</td></tr><tr><td>Group EBITDAI</td><td>50%</td><td>$1,245m</td><td>0%</td><td>Did not meet threshold</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Customer experience - iNPS and digital journey completion rate (JCR)</td><td rowspan="2">25%</td><td>+37 (iNPS)</td><td rowspan="2">28%</td><td rowspan="2">Exceeded target (iNPS)

# Long-term incentive scheme

For FY24 the CEO's annual LTI was granted as share options under the Spark Long Term Incentive Scheme. This is covered in more detail in the LTI scheme section. The LTI component of the CEO's remuneration package is designed to link part of her remuneration to the long-term performance of Spark, and align her interests with those of shareholders, through the grant of options with a post-allocation performance hurdles.

# Performance hurdles

Performance hurdles apply to long-term incentives made to the CEO. The hurdles are agreed by the Board and set a minimum level of performance that is required to be achieved over the period of each grant, for the LTI to be eligible to vest. For FY24, the targets were Spark's aTSR over the period to meet or exceed Spark's cost of equity plus  $1.5\%$  compounding annually (75% of grant) and three ESG targets (25% of grant).

Spark must meet or exceed these targets over the period of the grant (from the date the options are granted to the date three years after that date) for the relevant proportion of the options to vest. If Spark does not meet the target, the associated

proportion of those options will lapse. Testing to determine whether the aTSR and ESG performance hurdles have been met will occur at the end of the vesting period of the grant. The Board will receive independent advice to the effect that each performance hurdle has been met, or not met, in determining whether the CEO can exercise the options or whether the options will lapse.

# CEO termination

Spark may terminate the CEO's employment with three months' notice. A payment of nine months base remuneration will be made, plus entitlements for annual performance incentives and long-term incentives, subject to the rules relating to these incentives, in the case of termination by Spark, other than for termination for cause.

If there is a change of control that results in the CEO no longer being the CEO of a publicly listed company, then she will be able to terminate her employment with three months' notice and receive payment as if Spark had terminated her employment.

Spark may also terminate the CEO's employment without notice for defined causes, in which case she will receive no further entitlement to any remuneration.

# CEO remuneration

The total remuneration earned or paid in FY24, and anticipated target remuneration expected to be earned or paid in FY25, by and to the CEO, Jolie Hodson is as follows:

<table><tr><td>Period</td><td>Base salary1</td><td>Short-term incentive2</td><td>Long-term incentive3</td></tr><tr><td>FY24 actual remuneration</td><td>NZ$1,266,900</td><td>NZ$0</td><td>NZ$950,175, in the form of share options</td></tr><tr><td>FY25 anticipated target remuneration</td><td>NZ$1,266,900</td><td>NZ$950,175</td><td>NZ$950,175 in the form of share options</td></tr></table>

1. Base salary excludes employer contributions towards KiwiSaver and is not at risk.

The CEO's FY21 long-term grant, issued in 2020, did not vest in FY24 (2023) as the Absolute TSR hurdle was not achieved:

<table><tr><td>Grant year</td><td>Securities</td><td>Performance period</td><td>Performance measure</td><td>Vesting outcome</td><td>Shares lapsed</td><td>Value transferred</td></tr><tr><td>FY21</td><td>Options</td><td>September 2020 
– September 2023</td><td>Absolute Total Shareholder Return (aTSR), hurdle - Spark&#x27;s annual cost of equity + 1% compounding</td><td>100% lapsed - 3-year TSR result was 20.35% compared with a 31.60% target</td><td>187,430</td><td>NZ$0</td></tr></table>

2. The gross amount earned in FY23 and paid in FY24 was $501,692.  
3. FY24 long-term incentive was granted in 2023 and, subject to performance hurdles, will vest in September 2026.

The CEO is expected to acquire and hold shares that are at least equivalent in value to  $25\%$  of the CEO's base salary but ideally would increase this shareholding to  $100\%$  of base salary subject to the vesting of shares under any long-term incentive schemes. To fulfil this expectation, shares are to be acquired within a four-year period from 1 July 2019. As at 30 June 2024 the CEO holds 311,830 ordinary shares which exceeds the ideal shareholding requirement to hold shares that are at least equivalent in value to  $100\%$  of the CEO's base salary.

# Board remuneration

# Director remuneration

The remuneration of directors is reviewed annually by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee (HRCC), taking account of the company's size and complexity and the responsibilities, skills, performance, and experience of the directors, with recommendations made to the Board for approval. Specialist independent consultants may be engaged from time to time to provide advice and ensure that the remuneration of Spark's directors is appropriate and comparable to that of similar companies in New Zealand and Australia.

Apart from the CEO, no Director of Spark receives compensation in the form of share options or restricted shares, nor do they participate in any bonus or profit-sharing plan. Non-executive directors are, however, expected to maintain a holding of Spark shares as set out on page 160 of this report. As is the case for employees, directors are required to comply with the Insider Trading Policy when buying or selling Spark shares and any such transactions are disclosed to the market.

# Remuneration components

No superannuation or retirement allowance was paid to any Spark Director during FY24. Spark does not have service contracts with any Director, apart from the CEO, that provide for any benefits or remuneration in the event that a Director's service with Spark is terminated. New Zealand-based non-executive directors are eligible for Spark-funded medical insurance, and all non-executive directors are also eligible for Spark-funded life insurance.

# FY24 Director remuneration

The total remuneration available to non-executive directors is fixed by shareholders. The current annual remuneration limit is $1,630,000 approved at the annual meeting held in November 2017.

The fees payable to non-executive directors during FY24 were:  

<table><tr><td>Board/Committee1</td><td>Chair2</td><td>Member3</td></tr><tr><td>Board of Directors</td><td>$381,700</td><td>$150,300</td></tr><tr><td>Audit and Risk Management Committee (ARMC)</td><td>$40,500</td><td>$19,700</td></tr><tr><td>Human Resources and Compensation Committee (HRCC)</td><td>$34,700</td><td>$17,400</td></tr></table>

1. All non-executive directors are members of the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee (NOMs) and receive no additional fees for this role.  
2. Committee chair and member fees were not payable to the Chair of the Board. Committee member fees were not payable to committee chairs.  
3. Member fees were payable for each Committee.

There is no increase to non-executive Director fees for FY25. Fees will continue to be paid out of the current shareholder-approved annual remuneration limit of $1,630,000.

Committee membership as at 30 June 2024 was as follows:

1. The figures shown are gross amounts and exclude GST (where applicable) and are rounded to the nearest dollar.  
2. All non-executive directors are members of the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee (NOMs) and receive no additional fees for this role.  
3. This table excludes contributions towards medical and life insurance of a total of  $17,154. Spark meets costs incurred by directors that are incidental to the performance of their duties. This includes providing New Zealand-based directors with mobile phones and$ 120 per month which can be used towards Spark products or services and overseas-based directors with $400 per month phone allowances. Spark also meets the costs of directors' Spark-related travel. As these costs are incurred by Spark to enable directors to perform their duties, no value is attributable to them as benefits to directors for the purposes of the above table.  
4. Mr MacLeod was appointed Chair of the ARMC from 3 November 2023.  
5. Ms Nelson was appointed a Director and a member of the ARMC and HRCC from 8 May 2024.  
6. This figure includes the additional  $2,225 Ms Nelson earned as a member of the MATTR Investment Committee during FY24 (as a pro-rata payment based on her time served on the Committee). Prior to joining the Board, Ms Nelson earned US$ 36,000 as a consultant to MATTR during FY24.  
7. Mr Sitch resigned as a Director from 3 November 2023.

# Other directors' fees

Mr Richard Quince received a Director's fee of NZ$10,000 (excluding GST) for acting as a Director of Teleco Insurance (NZ) Limited.

# Our governance and ESG management

To achieve our purpose, Spark must successfully execute our business strategy while maintaining high standards of operational performance and corporate governance.

Our Sustainability Framework focuses our ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) activities in the areas we can make the most meaningful impact - New Zealand's economic transformation, digital equity, and our own sustainable business practices. To realise these ambitions ESG is integrated into our ways of operating and governance, as outlined in this section.

# Maintaining high standards of corporate governance

The Board regularly reviews and assesses Spark's governance structures and processes to ensure that they are consistent with international best practice, in both form and substance.

Spark has complied with the recommendations of the NZX Corporate Governance Code and substantially complied with the principles and recommendations of the ASX Corporate Governance Council's Principles and Recommendations (4th Edition) for the FY24 reporting period. You can read about how we have complied with these recommendations and principles in Spark's Annual Corporate Governance Statement FY24: www.spark.co.nz/online/about/our-company/governance

Our Framework includes three key focus areas - Economic Transformation, Digital Equity, and a Sustainable Spark. These commitments sit alongside our Māori Strategy, Te Korowai Tupu, which informs how we develop strong connections with Māori and builds our understanding of Te Ao Māori.

The framework is informed by our materiality assessment (see page 163). While the three focus areas are enduring, the activities within them will evolve over time to ensure we are responsive to our changing operating environment and the needs of our stakeholders.

# ESG reporting

We seek to present a clear and transparent assessment of our ESG performance in our reporting. This report is prepared in accordance with the International <IR> Framework and with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).

We focus our reporting on sustainability topics that substantively influence the assessments and decisions of stakeholders or have a significant environmental, social, or economic impact. We also consider whether a matter could substantively affect our ability to create value in the short, medium, or long term.

A detailed appendix to this report (see pages 163 - 174) includes a summary of our approach to materiality, our GRI Index, and information on our stakeholders and memberships of organisations.

# Climate change and emissions reporting

Our FY24 report incorporates climate-related disclosures, which have been prepared in compliance with the Aotearoa New Zealand Climate Standards (NZ CS 1, NZ CS 2 and NZ CS 3) issued by the External Reporting Board (XRB). Our climate-related disclosures are on page 90.

Spark's standalone Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report provides a detailed account of our emissions. Deloitte provides limited assurance of the emissions included in the report, which is available here: www.spark.co.nz/online/about/ourcompany/governance

In the past we have chosen to participate in voluntary disclosures to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). However, with the introduction of mandatory climate disclosures in New Zealand we have chosen to focus our attention on our expanded disclosures against the new local reporting standards, meaning we will not submit a CDP response in FY24. We will review this position in future years.

# Modern slavery and human rights reporting

Spark publishes a dedicated annual Modern Slavery and Human Rights Statement.

We report how we are identifying, mitigating, and remedying modern slavery risks in our business and our supply chain, including actions taken over the past year to strengthen our systems and processes and audit and engage our suppliers.

This statement provides a detailed summary of our approach to upholding our Human Rights Policy within our business, including our approach to human rights due diligence and how we are approaching the acceleration of technologies, such as AI and Generative AI.

# Integrating ESG into our governance processes

Spark is committed to the continuous improvement of our ESG performance. Our sustainability governance structure helps us ensure sustainability is overseen at the highest levels of our organisation and embedded throughout our everyday operations.

Our Board and Leadership Squad have oversight of our sustainability performance. Quarterly updates on our performance against our sustainability KPIs are provided to the Leadership Squad, which serves as a business-wide sustainability steering committee. The Board has overall governance responsibility for sustainability and is provided with a quarterly update on sustainability performance. The Board also approves the sustainability framework and reviews and approves key policies related to ESG.

In the past year we have evolved the structure of our squads that support our ESG performance. Our long-standing ESG Squad has been split into a Governance and Reporting Squad and a Human Rights and Supply Chain Squad. The Governance and Reporting Squad is an evolution of the ESG Squad, a cross-functional group accountable for our performance, reporting, and risk management, including representatives from Spark's financial, risk, legal, investor relations, regulatory affairs, people and culture, and corporate relations functions. The squad is led by Spark's Sustainability Lead.

The newly established Human Rights and Supply Chain Squad is focussed on actions to further embed these topics into Spark's day-to-day operations. The squad is also led by Spark's Sustainability Lead, and includes representative from our value management (supply chain), legal, digital trust, and Entelar Group teams. This Squad reports to a dedicated Steering Committee including Leadership Squad representation from the Corporate Relations and Sustainability, Network and Operations, and People and Culture directors.

Our Emissions Reduction Squad is led by Spark's Environment Manager and comprises 20 employees working across the Spark Group. This Squad is split into three workstreams, focussed on mobile networks, data centres, and fleet. We measure and report our energy use and emissions on a quarterly basis to the Leadership Squad. For more information see the Our Environment section on page 47.

In the past year we established a new Data Ethics Committee, which replaces our Data Governance Risk Committee. The Committee includes representatives from the Leadership Squad and provides oversight of our Artificial Intelligence Principles and how they are embedded into our ways of working, processes, and systems. For more information see our section on AI Governance on page 34.

With the incoming Aotearoa New Zealand Climate Standards, the Board and Leadership Squad also adopted a formal due diligence process for Spark's climate disclosures, including the creation of a Due Diligence Committee. The Committee includes representatives from the Leadership Squad who reviewed the disclosures against the requirements and principles of the Climate Standards. For more information see our section on climate-related disclosures on page 90.

We publish a summary of our approach to sustainability at Spark on our website: www.spark.co.nz/online/about/sustainability

# Benchmarking our ESG performance

We benchmark our performance using a number of international frameworks, including the Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA). The CSA is a comprehensive benchmark of our ESG maturity against our peers, with good coverage against our material sustainability issues. The CSA is now a part of S&P Global and is the assessment framework behind inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) global series.

Our approach to ESG management has seen our score, and relative ranking against global industry peers, increase year-on-year in the CSA benchmark into the top quartile of all global telecommunications companies. As a result, and in recognition of our progress and regional leadership, Spark is a member of the DJSI Australia Index, first joining in FY23 and maintaining our place on the index in FY24.

We also participate in the Worldwide Benchmarking Alliance's annual Digital Inclusion Benchmark. This includes an assessment of our broader social responsibility governance alongside a detailed assessment of our digital inclusion programmes. Spark is currently ranked in the top quartile of this benchmark.

# Public policy and lobbying commitment

Spark publishes a Public Policy and Lobbying Commitment that sets clear rules and processes for us to follow as we seek to engage on public policy, either directly or via government relations agencies. This is available on our website here: www.spark.co.nz/online/about/our-company/governance

This Commitment includes our policy to not make donations to political parties in New Zealand or any other jurisdictions.

We also committed to disclosing our engagement with lobbying services providers. In the past year we have retained the services of government relations agency Thompson Lewis. As one of New Zealand's largest businesses and a lifeline utility, we have an important role to play in the development of policies relevant to our sector and operations. We use this agency to provide additional resource that enables us to effectively fulfil this role.

# Our approach to tax

The Spark Group Tax Strategy reflects our responsible and transparent approach to tax. We recognise that the taxes we pay help underpin Aotearoa's economy in the same way that our ongoing investment in digital infrastructure will underpin Aotearoa's digital economy. As a New Zealand-based company we believe that it is important to clearly articulate our tax contribution to provide certainty and confidence to all stakeholders. As a large business, we make a significant contribution to New Zealand's tax base, including $189 million of New Zealand income taxes during FY24 (before any tax credits were applied).

In FY24 Spark's effective tax rate was  $38.5\%$ , which is higher than the New Zealand domestic tax rate of  $28\%$ , primarily due to the one-off tax impact arising from the removal of tax depreciation on commercial buildings that formed part of the New Zealand Government's 2024 Budget announcements.

Breakdown of income tax payments FY24

In addition to income tax paid by Spark, the Spark Group has payment and collection obligations across a wide range of tax types resulting in an excess of $586 million of taxes under management during FY24.

# Our risk management

# Managing risk

Our risk policy and framework help our people to manage uncertainty and adapt to challenges as they pursue Spark's strategy. Oversight by the Audit and Risk Management Committee (ARMC) and the diligent application of the defined roles and responsibilities across the business ensures our risk management system remains effective.

The policy and framework are benchmarked to COSO ERM 2017 (COSO), a leading practice risk management standard. We also use other leading risk management standards like ISO31000:2018 and specific standards and guidance, where available, to benchmark and inform our risk management practices.

Spark's framework is structured into five risk management domains that all work together to enable a robust system for risk management. Below is a description of each domain and some examples of activities by domain to help understand the framework in more depth. These five domains are embedded in Spark's Managing Risk Framework and ensure the 'Three Lines of Defence' Risk Model (1. Own and manage 2. Monitor and 3. Provide independent assurance) is utilised.

# Governance and culture

This domain reinforces the importance of risk management and influences how people apply the framework. Managing risk is embedded in our organisational structure, our functional activities, and is supported by specialist resources from the Risk team. Examples include the risk policy and the defined governance structure that supports its application across Spark. More information on the roles and responsibilities are included in the table on page 162.

# Strategy and objective setting

This domain focuses on integrating risk management into strategy setting and business planning. Examples include the consideration of risks and opportunities to business objectives when making strategy decisions and checking in with every function using a systematic method as part

![](images/df3c6b24daa28d59e0824eadfbcba3fbaf1e99b4fef03081fe23a57a3c432a9a.jpg)

of the Quarterly Business Review process. Each quarter the Leadership Squad communicates the top priorities for the business to the Wider Leadership Group, and supports execution with strategic guidance and access to extra resources as needed.

# Performance

This domain involves maintaining a portfolio view of risks under active management. Examples include maintaining a principal risk profile that is used by the ARMC and Leadership Squad to understand relevant risks and how they are being managed. It also focuses on the quality of the embedded risk management practices that are used within functions across the business. These two views enable in-depth analysis of relevant business risks and how they are being managed from a top-down and bottom-up perspective.

# Review and revision

This domain involves identifying and implementing opportunities to continuously improve risk management practices. Examples include regular internal and external assessments of the policy and framework.

# Information, reporting, and communication

This domain focuses on guiding Spark on how to use the policy and framework. Examples include information pages, access to support channels, and education sessions.

The policy and framework are assessed annually, and externally every three years to ensure they remain effective. All assessment results and agreed actions are shared with the ARMC to ensure they remain informed about the status of the policy and framework.

# Spark's principal business risks

Principal risk profiles are updated twice yearly. The last update was finalised in May 2024. The principal risk themes identified were:

# Protecting Spark and its customers from a major cyber-attack or data breach

Evolving external threats, changing legislation, and high expectations from customers and stakeholders mean robust security and privacy roadmaps, and strong governance through the Information Security Risk Management Committee (which includes five members from the Leadership Squad is needed to ensure that significant risks are managed. The Cyber Security tribe is responsible for critical operational controls to ensure standards and compliance are upheld. Our Digital Trust team sets privacy frameworks and standards that Agile units need to apply to maintain appropriate operational controls for privacy. Spark also has a data retention policy, that sets out considerations and, in some cases, rules for data retention. Adherence audits for compliance with the data retention policy are performed by the Internal Audit team.

External reviews and certifications help to ensure that comprehensive security measures exist for the critical elements of our cyber security framework. These reviews include security maturity assessments and security device configuration audits to ensure our processes meet expected standards.

# Maintaining a resilient network and delivering technology and network leadership

The use of established and proven delivery methods for large-scale network and technology projects (such as our 5G rollout) will help us to manage potential risks created by the delivery of new technologies and will also sustain our existing technology. This also includes long-term physical risk to infrastructure from climate change. With a high share of operational cost, Spark's technology units also continue to execute net-cost reduction while maintaining operational standards. In addition to cost optimisation mitigations, technology units have robust operational risk management processes, which provide visibility and enable a coordinated response to risk.

# Estimating economic environment impacts and responding with balanced judgement

The economic environment remains challenging, characterised by high costs, elevated interest rates, and rising unemployment, which is having a significant impact on customer behaviour. As a result, customers across all business segments are increasingly looking for ways to reduce their spending. The SME sector, in particular, is experiencing a higher rate of business closures, while the enterprise and government sector is experiencing the impact of government agency spending reductions and reduced private sector investment. Although Spark has been impacted less than some parts of the economy, Management continues to monitor this risk closely by adapting its strategies to ensure resilience and sustainability in our operations.

# Delivering planned artificial intelligence (AI) and business system transformation objectives

Delivering planned AI and business system investments is a key enabler of SPK-26.

A dedicated Transformation Lead and Programme has been established to lead these investments and ensure they are deployed in a complementary manner. Dedicated squads have been established to ensure deployment by teams with the required skills.

Spark has identified key use cases for Generative AI to support growth and improved efficiency across the business. As Generative AI is developing rapidly, Spark's Data and AI Governance approach has evolved during the year, to build on existing policies and practices that ensure a safe and ethical deployment of AI within the business. This is detailed on page 34.

Migrating large corporate customers from legacy technologies and products, whilst balancing customer experience and churn remains a challenge when implementing business system transformation. This is managed through high levels of collaboration from internal resources and tools that model and support decision-making.

# Achieving revenue growth

As Spark strives to achieve revenue growth, there is inherent risks associated with both our traditional and emerging revenue streams. Growth in our traditional revenue sources, such as mobile and broadband services, continue to face challenges from increased competition and market saturation. Meanwhile, our new revenue streams, including data centres, cloud, and high-tech, are subject to rapid technological changes, competition, and market acceptance risk. To mitigate these risks and ensure sustainable growth, our Leadership Squad continuously monitors and manages business strategies. This involves proactive intervention to address any issues and staying up to date with industry trends and technological advancements. Our aim is to strike a balance between risk and opportunity, and to steer Spark towards a future of innovation, while creating diverse and long-term revenue growth.

# Cost optimisation while maintaining operational standards and resilient service

Executing net cost reduction is a strength for Spark, and we do it in a way that ensures operational delivery standards for customers are maintained. The recent redesign of the operating model, AI and automation, ongoing simplification, and digitising customer journeys help to provide Spark with a more sustainable operating model and cost base moving forward. To mitigate unintended risks (for example, customer service disruptions), the Leadership Squad has established a strong governance structure, coupled with a formal delivery methodology to ensure all initiatives are robustly tested. Trajectory toward targets is measured, which enables intervention and course corrections when required.

# Business continuity and crisis management

The Business Continuity and Crisis Management Policy protects customers from the impact of disruptive events and ensures value-generating activities are resilient and comply with relevant external standards, for example Civil Defence and 111 obligations.

Spark's framework is benchmarked to ISO 22301 and ISO 22313, which are acknowledged as leading practice standards for business continuity. It is overseen by the ARMC in a similar way to the Managing Risk Policy and Framework. An internal Governance Committee consisting of tribe leads from across Spark, oversees and supports the implementation and maintenance of Business Continuity programme activities across the Spark Group. Regular reviews of the framework are performed by the Service Resilience and Risk and Internal Audit teams to ensure it is effective. External reviews and testing of key elements of the framework such as the Level One Crisis Management Plan and Team are also done to validate the effectiveness of Spark's business continuity framework. Our continued investment in network resiliency, as outlined on page 42, also demonstrates application of the framework in practice.

# Spark climate-related disclosures

# Introduction

Climate change has the potential to cause significant disruption to all New Zealand businesses, including Spark. This includes risks to our business due to changing economic conditions, disruption to our supply chain, operations, and infrastructure, and to our customers. Climate change also creates opportunities for Spark to support our customers to reduce their emissions and adapt to the potential impacts of a warming climate.

# Compliance with Climate Standards

Spark introduced climate risk reporting, aligned to the international Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework, in our FY21 Annual Report. This year's report marks the first time we have reported under the new mandatory disclosure regime, which builds on the foundations of the voluntary TCFD standards.

These climate statements have been prepared in compliance with the Aotearoa New Zealand Climate Standards (NZ CS 1, NZ CS 2 and NZ CS 3) issued by the External Reporting Board (XRB). Climate Standard NZ CS 2 provides a number of adoption provisions, which reporters may elect to use. Spark New Zealand has elected to apply the following adoption provisions in our first mandatory reporting period:

- Adoption provision 1 (related to current financial impacts)  
- Adoption provision 2 (related to anticipated financial impacts)  
- Adoption provision 3 (related to transition plan). We have included details of the transition plan aspects of our strategy in this report, however intend to refine these disclosures in FY25 once anticipated regulatory guidance has been released.  
- Adoption provision 5 (related to comparatives for Scope 3 GHG emissions)  
- Adoption provision 6 (related to comparatives for metrics)  
- Adoption provision 7 (related to analysis of trends)

# Important notice, challenges, and uncertainties

Our climate-related disclosures and the conclusions we make in these disclosures reflect our current understanding as at August 2024. This includes current and forward-looking information regarding climate change, its impact on Spark, and our response to it. Climate change, and the impacts it will have on individual businesses, is subject to significant uncertainty. The information in this report is based on estimates, judgements, assumptions, and incomplete data that we consider to be appropriate under current circumstances. As such, we caution reliance being placed on information that is subject to significant uncertainty and data limitations.

This report includes forward-looking statements, including in relation to climate-related scenarios, targets, risks and opportunities, anticipated impacts, and transition plans. Such forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of, and assumptions made by, our Management, along with information currently available at the time such statements were made. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees or predictions of future performance. Any statements in these climate statements that are not historical facts are forward looking statements.

Spark New Zealand Limited is a climate-reporting entity under Part 7A of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (FMA). These climate statements relate to the Spark Group, which consists of Spark New Zealand Limited and its subsidiaries. While Spark Finance Limited (a subsidiary of Spark New Zealand Limited) also meets the definition of a climate-reporting entity under the FMA, the Financial Markets Conduct (Climate Statements - Spark Finance Limited) Exemption Notice 2024 (available at www.fma.govt.nz/ assets/Exemption/Financial-Markets-Conduct-Climate-Statements-Spark-Finance-Limited-Exemption-Notice-2024.pdf) exempts it from the requirement to prepare climate statements.

This section of our Annual Report is structured around the four themes of climate governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. However, in some instances, information is included in these climate statements by cross-reference to other sections of our Annual Report or to our stand-alone Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report. Deloitte provides limited assurance of the emissions

included in the report, which is available here: https://investors.sparknz.co.nz/ investor-centre/?page=annual-reports. A table showing the location of each of our disclosures referenced against the requirements of the Aotearoa New Zealand Climate Standards is included on page 167.

Approved on behalf of the Board on 22 August 2024.

# Climate governance

# Governance body oversight of climate risk and opportunities

The Spark Board is the governance body responsible for oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities. The Board is informed and engaged on climate change through a number of regular processes:

through oversight of Spark's overarching enterprise risk management system (via the ARMC), which incorporates our most material climate risks  
through approval of, and engagement in, Spark's climate scenario risk analysis processes and annual climate risk reporting  
through quarterly sustainability updates from the Corporate Relations and Sustainability Director, and non-cyclical Board papers which include climate related risks or opportunities

The Audit and Risk Management Committee (ARMC), a subcommittee of the Spark Board, assists the Board in relation to the oversight of the risk management framework and monitoring compliance with that framework. The ARMC meets at least four times each year and receives regular updates on all principal business risks, including regular updates on the key

risk 'Maintaining a resilient network', which includes physical adaptation risk to our networks, and risk in our network supply chain (see detailed climate risk tables on pages 97). The papers from ARMC meetings are available to the Board and all directors may attend meetings of the ARMC.

The Board is also responsible for Spark's external climate reporting published with our annual financial disclosures. This includes review and approval of the climate risks and opportunities identified, which is published alongside our emissions metrics and performance against our climate targets. For this year's disclosures the Board was engaged in our refreshed climate scenario analysis, to pressure test the climate scenario narratives and validate the identified effects on Spark.

The Board is provided a sustainability update on a quarterly basis, including as part of annual integrated reporting for year-end. In FY24, these updates covered a range of topics, including performance against KPIs (including tracking emissions and energy use) and also on broader topics, such as climate risk. This, together with additional papers that contain climate-related content, mean that climate-related risks and opportunities are discussed regularly at Spark Board meetings.

As the governance body for significant sustainability and climate-related decisions, the Board approves Spark's sustainability framework, policies, and targets (such as Spark's science-based emissions reduction target, approved in FY21), and approval of key initiatives, such as our renewable energy partnership with Genesis Energy (see page 51).

Our directors are expected to continuously educate themselves to ensure that they have the appropriate expertise and can effectively perform their duties. Sustainability, together with risk management and regulatory, is one of the competencies assessed in our Board Skills Matrix (see page 21). The Board has been provided with briefings and sessions during FY24 to support further development of skills relating to the oversight and management of climate risk and to foster its climate expertise. Expertise is also gained by directors who have directorships in industries with related climate risks. Jolie Hodson, Spark CEO and Board member, is also a member of the Climate Leaders Coalition's Steering Committee.

A description of how the Board considers climate-related opportunities when developing and overseeing Spark's strategy, and the way in which resiliency (related to physical risk) is integrated into our business, is set out on page 93.

The Board is also responsible for remuneration policies. For our Leadership Squad and a select group of senior leaders, a long-term incentive (LTI) forms part of their remuneration package. This scheme is tied to performance measures relating to Spark's ESG performance, including performance against our emissions reduction target, which constitutes  $12.5\%$  of the LTI performance assessment weighting.

An overview of the climate-related risks and opportunities responsibilities as between the Spark Board and Management is described on page 92.

# Management's role in climate risk and opportunities

Climate-related responsibilities are assigned across a number of the Spark Leadership Squad (direct reports to the CEO) and supported by a number of internal governance groups and processes:

- The Finance Director is responsible for management of our overarching risk management system  
- The Corporate Relations and Sustainability Director is responsible for Spark's overall sustainability strategy  
- The Network and Operations Director is responsible for our most material climate change risks, which are integrated into the key risk 'Maintaining a resilient network' in our enterprise risk management system, and progress against our emissions reduction target

For the preparation of these climate statements in FY24, the Board and Leadership Squad established a formal due diligence process and approved the establishment of a Due Diligence Committee to oversee the preparation of the climate statements. This Committee is comprised of the Leadership Squad members identified above, as well as the Spark General Counsel.

For broader issues the full Leadership Squad serves as Spark's sustainability steering group, with a standing agenda item each quarter to review performance against sustainability KPIs, discuss risks and opportunities and make decisions related to climate change and our broader sustainability work. The Corporate Relations and Sustainability Director then provides a quarterly sustainability update to the Spark Board. The key sustainability KPI that relates to climate change is our emissions reduction target - see page 105 for more information.

In FY24, the Leadership Squad was also engaged in our refreshed climate scenario analysis, supporting the development of our climate scenario narratives and exploring the identified effects on Spark. The Leadership Squad is also engaged in the annual preparation and review of our Annual Report, meaning all Leadership

Squad members are informed about climate-related risks and opportunities on an annual basis.

The Leadership Squad is also regularly updated on risks identified in our Enterprise Risk Management System. Spark's Risk, Audit and Fraud Lead provides a quarterly update to the ARMC, a subcommittee of the Board. Our risk management system helps our people to manage uncertainty and adapt to challenges as they pursue our strategy.

A number of supporting squads are led by Spark's Sustainability Lead and Environment Manager. This includes our Governance and Reporting Squad and Emissions Reduction Squad. These squads report progress to the Leadership Squad and Board through the quarterly sustainability updates.

The Governance and Reporting squad is an evolution of the ESG Squad, a cross-functional group accountable for our performance, reporting, and risk management, including representatives from Spark's financial, risk, legal, investor relations, regulatory affairs, people and culture, and corporate relations functions. The squad is led by Spark's Sustainability Lead. The Emissions Reduction Squad is led by Spark's Environment Manager and comprises 20 employees working across the Spark Group, mostly in Network and Operations. This squad is split into three workstreams, focussed on mobile networks, data centres, and fleet.

# Strategy and climate change

# Integration of climate change and transition planning into strategy

Spark does not have a stand-alone climate transition plan. Our climate strategy and transition plan actions are integrated into our overarching strategy and business processes. Because of this interconnectedness we have chosen to integrate our climate disclosures within our integrated annual report. Our climate-related risk and opportunity tables (see pages 97 to 101) report the actions we are taking against each of the climate change risks and opportunities we have identified.

As an infrastructure provider with assets distributed across New Zealand, we have robust processes established to manage physical risk across our business, which includes resilience to climate change alongside other hazards such as earthquake risk. We focus on ensuring that these existing business processes are prepared for the increase in frequency and severity of climate incidents, and that our investment in the resilience of our infrastructure is informed by the latest climate science. Resiliency (related to physical risk) is a key input into our network capital deployment and funding. For information on our investment into resilience see page 42.

The Board and Leadership Squad considered opportunities from climate change when setting Spark's three-year strategy launched in FY23. A key focus of the strategy is enabling New Zealand businesses to grow and become more productive and sustainable through technology, which explains how we will support New Zealand's transformation to a high-productivity, low-carbon economy.

The aspects of our strategy aligned to transition planning inform our capital deployment and funding decision-making process. For example, in October we acquired Adroit, a leading IoT provider that specialises in technology solutions for real-time environmental monitoring, with solutions that are used across worksites, construction, agriculture, aquaculture,

councils, and infrastructure sectors. In the past year we have also added formal climate and emissions considerations into our capital deployment and funding decision-making processes.

The sustainability elements of our strategy are expanded in our Toitū Sustainability at Spark framework, published on page 84 of this report. We include a description of our business model and strategy, using the <IR> Integrated Reporting capitals model, on page 6 of this report.

Digital equity is a pillar of our sustainability framework. We know that as our economy decarbonises digital skills and access will become increasingly important for participation in society and the workplace, meaning digital equity is a key element of a socially just transition. See the Our Community section on pages 56 - 61 to learn more about our digital equity work.

Another commitment, under the Sustainable Spark pillar of our sustainability framework, is to reduce our impact on the natural environment. This includes our plans to transition our operations towards a lower emissions future. We have set an emissions reduction target with the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) to reduce our scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030, as explained further on page 105.

As the majority of our scope 1 and 2 emissions are from electricity, supporting investment in new renewable energy generation is our strategy to decouple our business growth from emissions growth, alongside other energy efficiency initiatives.

Our SBTi target also includes a supplier engagement target that  $70\%$  of our suppliers by spend, covering purchased goods and services and capital goods, will have SBTi-aligned targets in place by 2026. To achieve this, we are engaging with suppliers to support and encourage them to establish their own science-based emissions reduction targets.

# Current impacts of climate change

When considering physical impacts of climate change, over the last year we experienced no specific climate-related incidents beyond normal weather-related outages. In the previous year, the impact of Cyclone Gabrielle was significant. The cyclone caused significant and sustained power outages and destroyed many roads and bridges that hold fibre backhaul, which connects mobile towers to mobile exchanges. As a result of this, more than 600 mobile towers (across Spark, One New Zealand, and 2degrees) went offline during the storm. Within our network, only one of our cell sites sustained physical damage - all our outages were caused by power outages or fibre cuts. The Telecommunications Emergency Forum, a working party made up of key network operators and retailers, coordinated by the Telecommunications Forum (TCF), was activated immediately and worked alongside the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to coordinate an urgent industry response. Generators and satellite units were flown into the affected areas via helicopter, and our teams were on the ground to restore connectivity as soon as it was safe to do so. As a result of these efforts, within 96 hours, more than  $90\%$  of impacted towers were back online.

When considering transition opportunities, we continue to see growth in our high-tech revenues, which includes our IoT business. Much of this is driven by monitoring, including energy, water, and environmental monitoring. Although this is not driven by specific climate regulation, it is indicative of an increased focus among our customer base on investing in technology solutions for sustainability issues. We also continue to see interest from investors and customers in our climate change performance, including our emissions reduction target and reporting. This includes an increase in customer requests for scope 3 emissions data related to the products and services we supply. The role of satellite-enabled services is also evolving, both for fixed-broadband and direct to mobile services. Although resilience to weather events is one driver for early adoption, much of this market shift is driven by non-climate-related factors, such as coverage in rural areas.

Our climate risk tables outline all climate impacts and opportunities identified through our scenario analysis and internal risk processes. These include current impacts, which may increase over time, and potential future impacts.

# Climate scenario analysis

Spark has undertaken climate scenario analysis to help it to identify its climate-related risks and opportunities and develop a better understanding of the resilience of our business model and strategy.

Climate scenarios provide an opportunity for organisations to develop their internal capacity to better understand and prepare for the uncertain future impacts of climate change. They are plausible, challenging descriptions of how the future may develop based on a coherent and consistent set of assumptions about physical and transition risks:

- Physical risks: risks relating to the physical impacts of climate change. Physical risks emanating from climate change can be event-driven (acute) such as increased severity of extreme weather events. They can also relate to longer-term shifts (chronic) in precipitation and temperature and increased variability in weather patterns, such as sea level rise

Transition risks: risks related to the transition to a low-emissions, climate-resilient global and domestic economy, such as policy, legal, technology, market and reputation changes associated with the mitigation and adaptation requirements relating to climate change.

Over the past year Spark co-led a sectorwide approach to scenario development. A shared sector approach is recommended by the XRB. The sector scenarios were developed through a series of workshops, facilitated by environmental consultancy Tonkin + Taylor and our industry body The Telecommunications Forum (TCF). The process was guided by a focal question:

"How could climate change plausibly disrupt the telecommunications sector over the short (5 years), medium (15 years), and long-term (30+ years)?"

The sector-wide approach to climate risk supports collective engagement with other sectors and stakeholders. This is particularly important to inform long-term collaboration and planning and will be an important input to New Zealand's next National Climate Change Risk assessment due to be published by the Climate Change Commission in 2026. Throughout the process the sector consulted with the Ministry for the Environment, the Climate Change Commission, and representatives

from the energy sector who were integrated into the TCF process.

# Our three climate scenarios

The three climate scenarios the telecommunications sector selected are outlined in the tables on pages 97-101. These scenarios align to the requirements in NZ CS 1 for entities to analyse three scenarios, and each draw from a range of widely used global and local scenario archetypes, for example the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) representative concentration pathways (RCP) and the New Zealand Climate Change Commission decarbonisation pathways. They are also based on scenario archetypes that are consistent with those used by other infrastructure sectors in New Zealand to develop sector scenarios. The scenarios were designed and agreed in consultation across the sector. Given the broad range of inputs and alignment to recognised scenario archetypes we believe the scenarios capture a broad set of possible outcomes that are relevant and appropriate to assessing the resilience of our business model and strategy to climate-related risks and opportunities.

A full report of the sector climate scenarios is published on the TCF and Spark websites.

This includes detailed descriptions of the emissions reduction pathways in each scenario and the assumptions underlying pathway development over time, including the policy and socioeconomic assumptions and macroeconomic trends. It also includes full descriptions of the relevant scenario narratives, and an outline of the process followed to develop the scenarios. The report is available here: https://s.spark.co.nz/4fXRsoH.

These three scenarios have driven Spark's internal climate scenario analysis, which applied the detailed scenarios to our business and strategy, to identify risks and opportunities specific to Spark. This was a stand-alone process, independent of our existing risk governance. The scope of our climate scenario analysis covers all of Spark's operations and the entire value chain, from upstream supply chain impacts to downstream impacts on our customers and the broader economy. It covers all business activities, operating companies, and subsidiaries. The scenario analysis builds upon our previous scenario analysis and climate risk reporting, which mapped against scenarios equivalent to the

'disorderly'(RCP 4.5) and 'hothouse'(RCP 8.5) scenarios. While external stakeholders and partners were involved in the sector-based scenario development, Spark's internal process did not involve any external partners or stakeholders.

The Spark Board and Leadership Squad were engaged in the scenario analysis, developing and pressure testing the potential effects on Spark across each of the three scenarios against a number of categories:

Economic  
Business-to-business customers  
Consumer customers  
Government and policy  
Infrastructure  
Supply chain  
- Investors  
- Managed retreat  
Social

As noted on page 90, the Board has approved the climate-related risks and opportunities identified as a result of the scenario analysis process.

# Physical risk analysis

As part of our scenario analysis process in FY24, we also updated our physical risk analysis against updated data and climate models newly released by the Ministry for the Environment in July 2024. This analysed risk to our infrastructure and assets against the risks of sea level rise/coastal flooding, temperature, wind and rain pattern changes. This modelling provides information on the number and location of sites that may be of greater risk, and enables us to quantify the scale of potential impact and the investment required to mitigate risk, for example by strengthening or relocating vulnerable sites. Through the analysis we identified a small number of assets vulnerable to direct physical risks. This includes 24 mobile sites and one regional exchange vulnerable to coastal flooding under a 20cm sea level rise scenario. This is less than  $2\%$  of our infrastructure sites. We acknowledge the limitations and uncertainty of this mapping approach, including the lack of localised information on interconnected physical risk.

We will continue to update our physical risk analysis as new data becomes available, particularly data on supporting infrastructure. This will be an important input into our disclosure of anticipated financial impacts in future years.

# Climate-related risks and opportunities

The tables below outline the climate-related risks and opportunities that Spark has identified over the short, medium and long-term, together with the anticipated impacts of those climate-related risks and opportunities. As many of the risks and opportunities identified are present across all time horizons, we have explained the trend that these risks and opportunities follow across time horizons, identifying the horizon in which the risk or opportunity is most significant.

# Climate risk management

# Processes and tools for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks and integration into overall risk management processes

Our climate scenario analysis is our primary process for identifying new and emerging risks and opportunities from climate change. We completed our first climate scenario analysis in FY21, the results of which were published in our FY21 Annual Report. The risks and opportunities identified through this process have been reviewed and approved annually by our Board and Leadership Squad as part of annual reporting processes. For FY24 we refreshed our scenario analysis - see the Climate Scenario Analysis section on page 94 for more information on the processes we have followed to identify and assess risk, and the time horizons considered by our analysis. Our analysis included physical risk analysis and a high-level quantification of potential financial risks. As noted in the Strategy section of these climate statements, the scenario analysis process undertaken in FY24 considered Spark's entire value chain.

Our climate scenario analysis is an input into our overarching risk governance. Our risk policy and framework are benchmarked to COSO ERM 2017 (COSO), a leading practice risk management standard. We also use other leading risk management standards like ISO31000:2018 and specific standards and guidance, where available, to benchmark and inform our risk management practices.

Within our overarching risk framework, we update our principal risk profiles twice a year. Our risk framework is how we prioritise different types of risks across the

organisation. This considers risks to Spark delivering against its three-year strategy. The materiality of risks is considered against the likelihood of occurrence and the scale of financial impact. 'Maintaining a resilient network' is one of the principal risks, which includes physical adaptation risk to our networks, and risk in our network supply chain, aligned to the physical risks identified through our climate scenario analysis. See our managing risk section (page 88) for more detailed information on how Spark manages principal risks.

To ensure linkage between all of our sustainability/ESG risks (including climate change) we include a summary of sustainability risks in quarterly risk reporting to our Board and Leadership Squad. This lists our most material sustainability topics, identified through our sustainability materiality processes and our climate scenario analysis. We also map these topics across to our principal risks to show how we have integrated emerging and longer-term issues into our enterprise risk management approach.

The timeframes for our climate scenario analysis (5, 15 and  $30+$  years) extend beyond the time horizons considered by our principal risk assessment which is aligned to our three-year strategy horizon.

For emerging risks that fall outside of the principal risks described above, we identify actions for managing those risks outside the enterprise risk system. An example of an action from previous climate risk assessment is the research published into the role of digital technology in supporting emissions reductions (see page 47 for more information).

# Climate metrics and targets

# Climate-related metrics

The table below sets out our key climate-related metrics for FY24, by reference to the relevant paragraph of NZ CS 1. Outside of the metrics below, Spark does not use any industry-based metrics or key performance indicators to measure and manage climate-related risks and opportunities. We have included information relating to the methods, assumptions and uncertainties associated with the below metrics within the table, with further detail of the methods, assumptions and uncertainties relating to our GHG emissions outlined in our GHG Inventory Report.

# Our emissions reduction target

Spark's emissions reduction target received verification by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in 2021. SBTi targets must have a strict absolute reduction target for scope 1 and 2 emissions, and also include a separate scope 3 target if these emissions are greater than  $40\%$  of the total footprint.

SBTi targets are set against sector-specific emissions trajectories. The ICT sector pathways were developed with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) based on projected growth and efficiency gains. The wording of SBTi targets are set and verified by the Science Based Targets initiative, and follow a common format requiring companies to 'commit' to the target that has been established. For Spark this is as follows:

- Spark New Zealand commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions  $56\%$  by 2030 from a FY2020 base year.  
- Spark New Zealand commits that  $70\%$  of its suppliers by spend covering purchased goods and services and capital goods, will have SBTi-aligned targets in place by 2026.

This means Spark is committed to pursuing this target and we are working towards it. For clarity, this is not a guarantee that we will meet this target.

Our scope 1 and 2 target has been verified by SBTi as in line with a 1.5 degree pathway. Our supplier target is an engagement target, which means that it does not directly require us to reduce our emissions, but indirectly contributes to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees by requiring us to engage with our suppliers in relation to setting their own science-based targets.

To achieve our target, we are pursuing emissions reductions within our direct value chain. Spark does not intend to use carbon offsets to achieve our target. This approach aligns to SBTi rules which do not allow carbon offsets to be counted against emission targets. This target is a near-term target to FY30, and a first step towards establishing a long-term target contributing to New Zealand's net-zero ambition to 2050, which we plan to explore in the coming year. Further information on our SBTi target is available on page 48 of this report, together with a description of our performance against the target.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# Section 1 General information

# 1.1 About this report

# Reporting entity

These financial statements are for Spark New Zealand Limited (the Company) and its subsidiaries (together Spark or the Group).

Spark is a major supplier of telecommunications and digital services in New Zealand. Spark provides a full range of telecommunications, information technology, media and other digital products and services, including: mobile services; broadband services; IT products; IT services; voice services; procurement and partner services; high-tech and data centres.

The Company is incorporated and domiciled in New Zealand, registered under the Companies Act 1993 and is an FMC reporting entity under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013. The Company is listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZX) and the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) and the address of its registered office is Spark City, 167 Victoria Street West, Auckland 1010, New Zealand.

# Basis of preparation

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Practice in New Zealand (NZ GAAP). They comply with New Zealand equivalents to IFRS Accounting Standards (NZ IFRS) and other applicable Financial Reporting Standards, as appropriate for profit-oriented entities. The financial statements also comply with IFRS Accounting Standards (IFRS).

The measurement basis adopted in the preparation of these financial statements is historical cost, modified by the revaluation of certain investments and financial instruments, as identified in the accompanying notes. These financial statements are expressed in New Zealand dollars, which is Spark's functional and presentation currency. All financial information has been rounded to the nearest million, unless otherwise stated. Certain comparative information has been updated to conform with the current year's presentation.

The material accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out in the accompanying notes where an accounting policy choice is provided by NZ IFRS. A policy is also included when it is new, has changed, is specific to Spark's operations or is material. Where NZ IFRS does not provide an accounting policy choice, Spark has applied the requirements of NZ IFRS but a detailed accounting policy is not included.

# New and amended standards

NZ IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (NZ IFRS 17), is effective for FY24 and while Spark does have subsidiaries which provide insurance, this is not material to the Group, therefore there is no material impact on these financial statements from the adoption of NZ IFRS 17.

NZ IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements (NZ IFRS 18) will replace NZ IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and may have a material impact on Spark's disclosures. NZ IFRS 18 has been issued but is not yet effective until periods commencing on or after 1 January 2027.

NZ IFRS 18 sets out the requirements for the presentation and disclosure of information in financial statements, and will not change net profit reported, but how results are presented on the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and what information is disclosed in the notes. Spark is yet to determine the disclosure impacts of this standard and whether it will adopt it prior to the year ending 30 June 2028. The key changes of NZ IFRS 18 are expected to be:

- A more structured statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, including new subtotals, and income and expenses classified into three categories (operating, investing and financing).  
- Non-GAAP, management performance measures are required to be disclosed in the financial statements and subject to audit.  
- New disclosures are required for items currently labelled as 'other', with enhanced guidance on how to group information within the financial statements.

# 1.2 Key estimates and assumptions

The preparation of these financial statements requires Management to make estimates and assumptions. These affect the amounts of reported revenues and expenses and the measurement of assets and liabilities as at 30 June. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

The principal areas of judgement and estimation for Spark in preparing these financial statements are found in the following notes:

Note 2.2 Operating revenues and other gains  
Note 3.1 Receivables and prepayments  
Note 3.4 Right-of-use assets  
Note 3.6 Property, plant and equipment  
Note 3.7 Intangible assets  
Note 4.2 Lease liabilities

# 1.3 Significant transactions and events

The following significant transactions and events affected the financial performance and financial position of Spark for the year ended 30 June 2024 or subsequent to balance date:

# Share buy-back (see note 4.5)

- On 6 April 2023, Spark commenced an on-market share buy-back, which was further extended on 8 April 2024. The shares were acquired on the NZX and ASX, at prices in line with the prevailing market price from time to time during the period of the buy-back. As at 30 June 2024, 60 million shares with a value of $305 million had been repurchased and cancelled under the scheme. In the year ended 30 June 2024, 32 million shares with a value of $159 million were repurchased. The last purchase was made in December 2023. The on-market share buy-back programme has now been withdrawn.

# Dividends (see note 4.5)

- Dividends paid during the year ended 30 June 2024 in relation to the H2 FY23 second-half dividend (ordinary dividend of 13.5 cents per share) and H1 FY24 first-half dividend (ordinary dividend of 13.5 cents per share) totalled $494 million or 27.0 cents per share.

# Debt programme (see note 4.3)

- On 27 October 2023, Spark extended the term of its $200 million committed revolving Sustainability-Linked Loan facility with Westpac New Zealand Limited by three years, to mature on 30 November 2026.  
- On 7 March 2024, $125 million of unsecured, unsubordinated fixed-rate bonds with a coupon rate of  $3.37\%$  matured.  
- On 18 March 2024 Spark issued two series of unsecured, unsubordinated fixed-rate bonds;  $125 million with a coupon rate of \(5.21\%$ , maturing on 18 September 2029, and \)175 million with a coupon rate of  $5.45\%$ , maturing on 18 September 2031.  
- On 29 April 2024, Spark extended the term of its $200 million committed standby revolving credit facility provided through participating Australasian and global banks by one year, to mature on 30 April 2027.  
- On 30 May 2024, Spark established a $100 million committed revolving facility with Bank of New Zealand, maturing on 30 May 2025.

# Long-term investments (see note 3.3)

- The fair value of Spark's investment in Hutchinson Telecommunications Australia Limited decreased by  $20 million during the year due to a decrease in its quoted share price from AU$ 0.042 to AU$0.028. The change in fair value is recognised within other comprehensive income.  
- Spark contributed no further equity to its Southern Cross investment during FY24. Southern Cross has now fully repaid its shareholder loan, with $10 million received in FY24, and Spark received an additional $7 million in FY24 in the form of a capital reduction.

# Capital expenditure (see notes 2.5, 3.4, 3.6 and 3.7)

- Spark's additions to property, plant and equipment, intangible assets (excluding spectrum) and capacity right-of-use assets were \(518 million, details of which are provided in notes 2.5, 3.4, 3.6 and 3.7 and on page 17 of this Annual Report.

# Section 2 Financial performance information

# 2.1 Segment information

The segment results disclosed are based on those reported to the Chief Executive and are how Spark reviews its performance.

Spark's segments are measured based on product margin, which includes product operating revenues and direct product costs. The segment results exclude other gains, labour, other operating expenses, finance income and expense, depreciation and amortisation, net investment income and income tax expense, as these are assessed at an overall Group level by the Chief Executive.

# Comparative segment results

Spark has reclassified the comparative segment results to:

- Redistribute certain revenues between two new categories IT products (previously cloud, collaboration, managed data and networks) and IT services (previously service management and security)  
- Move Qrious, Internet of Things, and MATTR from other products into a new high-tech category  
- Split data centres out from cloud, and split co-location out from other products to create a combined data centres category.

There is no change to the overall Spark reported result because of these changes.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE INFORMATION

# 2.2 Operating revenues and other gains

The accounting policies specific to Spark's operating revenues are outlined below:

# Contracts with customers

Spark records revenue from contracts with customers in accordance with the five steps in NZ IFRS 15:

1. Identify the contract with a customer  
2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract  
3. Determine the transaction price, which is the total consideration provided by the customer  
4. Allocate the transaction price amount to the performance obligations in the contract based on their relative stand-alone selling prices  
5. Recognise revenue when or as the performance obligation is satisfied.

Spark often provides products and services in bundled arrangements (for example, a broadband modem together with a broadband service). Where multiple products or services are sold in a single arrangement, revenue is recognised in relation to each distinct good or service. A product or service is distinct where, amongst other criteria, a customer can benefit from it on its own or together with other resources that are readily available. Revenue is allocated to each distinct product or service in proportion to its stand-alone selling price and recognised when, or as, control is transferred to the customer.

Generally, control for products is transferred and revenue recognised at the point in time it is delivered to the customer and for services, control is transferred, and revenue recognised, over time as the service is provided. Revenue for performance obligations satisfied over time is recognised using the 'resources consumed by customers' method or the 'time- elapsed' method, as these best depict the transfer of goods or services to customers.

Performance obligations, where Spark acts as an agent, includes some third-party media services and certain cloud, security and service management contracts. Contracts with a significant financing component include those that have goods that were purchased on interest-free payment terms of greater than 12 months.

The nature of the various performance obligations in our contracts with customers and when revenue is recognised is outlined below:

<table><tr><td>PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS
FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS</td><td>TIMING OF SATISFACTION
OF THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION AND PAYMENT</td></tr><tr><td>Mobile services, broadband services, media services, cloud, security and service management services, managed data services and rental of equipment</td><td>As the service is provided (usually monthly). Generally billed and paid on a monthly basis.</td></tr><tr><td>Usage, other optional or non-subscription services, and pay-per-use services</td><td>As the service is provided. Generally billed and paid on a monthly basis.</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed modems, mobile handsets and other distinct goods</td><td>When control is passed to the customer, generally when the customer takes possession of the goods. For goods sold in packages or on interest-free terms, customers usually pay in equal instalments over 6 to 36 months.</td></tr><tr><td>Installation or set-up services (where distinct)</td><td>As the service is provided. Generally billed and paid following the provision of the service.</td></tr><tr><td>Network infrastructure</td><td>As the goods or services are provided. Generally billed when milestones are completed and revenue recognised when the milestones are completed or once control of goods passes to the customer.</td></tr></table>

In the year ended 30 June 2023, other gains included the net gain on sale of Connexa of  $583 million, gain on the sale and acquisition of property, plant and equipment (primarily in relation to mobile and data centre network equipment and other assets of$ 20 million), and gains from lease modifications and terminations of $13 million.

# 2.2 Operating revenues and other gains (continued)

# Key estimates and assumptions

# Determining the transaction price

Determining the transaction price of Spark's contracts requires judgement in estimating the amount of revenue we expect to be entitled to for delivering the performance obligations within a contract. The transaction price is the amount of consideration that is enforceable and to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for the goods and services we have promised to our customer. We determine the transaction price by considering the terms of the contract and business practices that are customary within that product, as well as adjusting the transaction price for estimated variable consideration and for any effects of the time value of money. The 'expected value' or 'most likely' amount methods are used to determine variable consideration and any amount where it is determined that it is highly probable a revenue reversal will not subsequently occur is included in the transaction price. In making this determination consideration is given to the likelihood and potential magnitude of the revenue reversal, as well as factors outside of Spark's influence, the time when the uncertainty is expected to be resolved and Spark's experience with similar types of contracts. Judgement is required to determine the discount rate underlying any time value of money calculations, as well as whether the financing component in a contract is significant. Discounts, rebates, refunds, credits, price concessions, incentives, penalties and other similar items are reflected in the transaction price at contract inception.

# Determining the stand-alone selling price and the allocation of the transaction price

Determining the stand-alone selling price of performance obligations and the allocation of the transaction price between performance obligations involves judgement. The transaction price is allocated to performance obligations based on the relative stand-alone selling prices of the distinct goods or services in the contract. The best evidence of a stand-alone selling price is the observable price of a good or service when the entity sells that good or service separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. If a stand-alone selling price is not directly observable, we estimate the stand-alone selling price taking into account reasonably available information relating to the market conditions, entity-specific factors and the class of customer. In determining the stand-alone selling price, we allocate revenue between performance obligations based on expected minimum enforceable amounts to which Spark is entitled. Any amounts above the minimum enforceable amounts are recognised as revenue as they are earned.

# Distinct goods and services

We make judgements in determining whether a promise to deliver goods or services is considered distinct. We account for individual products and services separately if they are distinct (i.e. if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if the customer can benefit from it). The consideration is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their stand-alone selling prices.

# Timing of satisfaction of performance obligations

We make judgements in determining whether performance obligations are satisfied over time or at a point in time, as well as the methods used for measuring progress towards completed satisfaction of performance obligations. Refer to page 114 for Spark's accounting policy on timing of satisfaction of performance obligations.

1 Interest was capitalised on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets under development for the year ended 30 June 2024 at an annualised rate of  $5.7\%$  (30 June 2023:  $4.3\%$ ).  
2 Included within share of associates' and joint ventures' net losses in the 2023 comparative is $4 million of transaction costs incurred by Connexa in relation to the 2degrees transaction which diluted Spark's investment in the Connexa group. Therefore, this and the net gain on remeasurement of equity accounted investments represent the net gain on dilution of the investment in the Connexa group which is excluded from the comparative adjusted result in note 2.5.

# 2.5 Non-GAAP measures

Spark uses non-GAAP financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with NZ IFRS. Spark believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to readers to assist in the understanding of the financial performance, financial position or returns of Spark. These measures are also used internally to evaluate performance of products, to analyse trends in cash-based expenses, to establish operational goals and allocate resources. However, they should not be viewed in isolation, nor considered as a substitute for measures reported in accordance with NZ IFRS, as they are not uniformly defined or utilised by all companies in New Zealand or the telecommunications industry.

# Earnings before finance income and expense, income tax, depreciation, amortisation and net investment income (EBITDAI)

Spark calculates EBITDAI by adding back finance expense, depreciation and amortisation and income tax expense, subtracting finance income and adjusting for net investment income (which includes Spark's share of net profits or losses from associates and joint ventures, interest income on loans receivable from associates and joint ventures, net gain on remeasurement of equity accounted investments and dividend income) to net earnings. A reconciliation of Spark's EBITDAI is provided below and based on amounts taken from, and consistent with, those presented in these financial statements.

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE</td><td>2024</td><td>2023</td></tr><tr><td>$M</td><td>$M</td></tr><tr><td>Net earnings reported under NZ IFRS</td><td>316</td><td>1,135</td></tr><tr><td>Less: finance income</td><td>(30)</td><td>(32)</td></tr><tr><td>Add back: finance expense</td><td>144</td><td>99</td></tr><tr><td>Add back: depreciation and amortisation</td><td>527</td><td>504</td></tr><tr><td>Add/(Less): net investment income</td><td>8</td><td>(1)</td></tr><tr><td>Add back: income tax expense</td><td>198</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>EBITDAI</td><td>1,163</td><td>1,722</td></tr></table>

# Adjusted EBITDAI and adjusted net earnings

Spark's policy is to present 'adjusted EBITDAI' and 'adjusted net earnings' when a financial year includes significant items (such as gains, expenses and impairments) individually greater than  $25 million. In the year ended 30 June 2024, the tax effects resulting from the zero-rating of tax depreciation on buildings effective for Spark from 1 July 2024 of$ 26 million was deemed a significant item to adjust. In the year ended 30 June 2023, the net gain on sale of Connexa of $583 million together with the subsequent $5 million net gain arising from the dilution of the investment in the Connexa group and the one off provision of $54 million for Spark Sport were deemed significant items to adjust.

# Net debt

Net debt at hedged rates, the primary net debt measure Spark monitors, includes long-term debt at the value of hedged cash flows due to arise on maturity, plus debt due within one year, less any cash. Net debt at carrying value includes the non-cash impact of fair value hedge adjustments and any unamortised discount.

Net debt at hedged rates is a non-GAAP measure and is not defined in accordance with NZ IFRS but is a measure used by management. A reconciliation of net debt at hedged rates and net debt at carrying value is provided in note 4.4.

Amounts are stated at their net carrying value, including expected credit loss allowance provisions. The fair value of finance lease receivables is estimated to be  $72 million (30 June 2023:$ 75 million) and the carrying amount of all other receivables, measured at amortised cost, are approximately equivalent to their fair value.

# Contract assets

Contract assets primarily relate to Spark's rights to consideration for performance obligations delivered but not billed at the reporting date. Contract assets are transferred to receivables when the rights become unconditional.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: ASSETS

# 3.1 Receivables and prepayments (continued)

# Contract costs

Contract costs include costs to obtain a contract and costs to fulfil a contract. These costs are expected to be recovered and are therefore initially deferred to the statement of financial position and then recognised within operating expenses on a systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates. The following summarises changes in those balances:

<table><tr><td rowspan="3">YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE</td><td rowspan="3">NOTES</td><td colspan="3">2024</td><td colspan="3">2023</td></tr><tr><td>COSTS TO OBTAIN A CONTRACT</td><td>COSTS TO FULFIL A CONTRACT</td><td>TOTAL</td><td>COSTS TO OBTAIN A CONTRACT</td><td>COSTS TO FULFIL A CONTRACT</td><td>TOTAL</td></tr><tr><td>$M</td><td>$M</td><td>$M</td><td>$M</td><td>$M</td><td>$M</td></tr><tr><td>Opening balance as at 1 July</td><td></td><td>21</td><td>119</td><td>140</td><td>17</td><td>91</td><td>108</td></tr><tr><td>Additions</td><td></td><td>13</td><td>52</td><td>65</td><td>10</td><td>61</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>Transferred to leased customer equipment assets</td><td>3.5</td><td>-</td><td>(4)</td><td>(4)</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Transferred to intangible assets</td><td>3.7</td><td>-</td><td>(4)</td><td>(4)</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Transferred to property, plant and equipment</td><td>3.6</td><td>-</td><td>(1)</td><td>(1)</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Amortisation recognised in operating expenses</td><td></td><td>(8)</td><td>(50)</td><td>(58)</td><td>(6)</td><td>(33)</td><td>(39)</td></tr><tr><td>Closing balance as at 30 June</td><td></td><td>26</td><td>112</td><td>138</td><td>21</td><td>119</td><td>140</td></tr><tr><td>Short-term contract costs</td><td></td><td>6</td><td>41</td><td>47</td><td>4</td><td>38</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>Long-term contract costs</td><td></td><td>20</td><td>71</td><td>91</td><td>17</td><td>81</td><td>98</td></tr></table>

# Key estimates and assumptions

Determining the costs incurred to obtain or fulfil a contract that meet the deferral criteria within NZ IFRS 15 requires significant judgement. Further, where such costs can be deferred, determining the appropriate amortisation period to recognise the costs within operating expenses requires management judgement, including assessing the expected average customer tenure for consumer customers and the expected contract term for enterprise customers.

# Expected credit loss allowance provision

Movements in the loss allowance provision are as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE</td><td>2024</td><td>2023</td></tr><tr><td>$M</td><td>$M</td></tr><tr><td>Opening balance as at 1 July</td><td>17</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Charged to costs and expenses</td><td>17</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Bad debts recovered</td><td>(2)</td><td>(2)</td></tr><tr><td>Utilised</td><td>(12)</td><td>(7)</td></tr><tr><td>Closing balance as at 30 June</td><td>20</td><td>17</td></tr></table>

# 3.1 Receivables and prepayments (continued)

Spark has applied the simplified approach to providing for expected credit losses, which requires the recognition of a lifetime expected loss provision for short-term: trade receivables, unbilled revenue, contract assets, contract costs, finance lease receivables and loans receivable. The calculation of the allowance provision incorporates Spark's previous collection history and forward-looking information, such as forecasted economic conditions.

The expected credit loss allowance provision has been determined as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">AS AT 30 JUNE 2024</td><td>CURRENT</td><td>≤1 MONTH</td><td>&gt;1 MONTH</td><td>TOTAL</td></tr><tr><td>$M</td><td>$M</td><td>$M</td><td>$M</td></tr><tr><td>Expected loss rate</td><td>1.2%</td><td>1.4%</td><td>8.8%</td><td>1.6%</td></tr><tr><td>Gross carrying amount</td><td>1,107</td><td>74</td><td>68</td><td>1,249</td></tr><tr><td>Expected credit loss allowance provision</td><td>13</td><td>1</td><td>6</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Short-term loss allowance provision</td><td>8</td><td>1</td><td>6</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Long-term loss allowance provision</td><td>5</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>5</td></tr></table>

<table><tr><td>AS AT 30 JUNE 2023</td><td>$M</td><td>$M</td><td>$M</td><td>$M</td></tr><tr><td>Expected loss rate</td><td>1.1%</td><td>1.7%</td><td>9.5%</td><td>1.4%</td></tr><tr><td>Gross carrying amount</td><td>1,087</td><td>59</td><td>42</td><td>1,188</td></tr><tr><td>Expected credit loss allowance provision</td><td>12</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>Short-term loss allowance provision</td><td>8</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Long-term loss allowance provision</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>4</td></tr></table>

The composition of the credit loss allowance provision between receivable types is as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">AS AT 30 JUNE</td><td>2024</td><td>2023</td></tr><tr><td>$M</td><td>$M</td></tr><tr><td>Trade receivables</td><td>8</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Unbilled revenue</td><td>7</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Contract assets and contract costs</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Finance lease receivables</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Loans receivable</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Expected credit loss allowance provision</td><td>20</td><td>17</td></tr></table>

The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when the Group determines that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities to comply with the Group's procedures for recovery of amounts due.

# Key estimates and assumptions

The expected credit loss allowance provision is determined based on assumptions about the risk of default and expected loss rates of customers and other counterparties. Spark uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the impairment calculation based on Spark's past collection history, existing market conditions, as well as forward-looking estimates at the end of the reporting period. Forward-looking estimates include assessment of forecasted changes to interest rates, unemployment rates and Gross Domestic Product in New Zealand.

# Finance lease receivables

Spark has a number of leases for space in exchange buildings, including as a lessor for space in Spark exchanges and a lessee for space in Chorus exchanges. These leases include a legal right of offset, as Spark and Chorus settle the payments on a net basis and are therefore shown as a net finance lease receivable or net lease liability on the statement of financial position.

In FY23, Spark assigned its ground leases for the mobile site assets sold to Connexa, which resulted in Spark recording finance lease receivables equal to the lease liabilities for these leases. Spark is unwinding these balances over the remaining term to the next right of renewal, at which point these will be novated.

In addition, Spark subleases a number of office building floors. Where subleases are for the whole of the remaining non-cancellable term of the head lease, these are classified as a finance lease.

The profile of lease net receipts is set out below:

<table><tr><td rowspan="3">AS AT 30 JUNE</td><td colspan="2">2024</td><td colspan="2">2023</td></tr><tr><td>UNDISCOUNTED</td><td>DISCOUNTED</td><td>UNDISCOUNTED</td><td>DISCOUNTED</td></tr><tr><td>$M</td><td>$M</td><td>$M</td><td>$M</td></tr><tr><td>Less than one year1</td><td>11</td><td>4</td><td>14</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Between one and five years</td><td>30</td><td>5</td><td>31</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>More than five years</td><td>135</td><td>71</td><td>141</td><td>69</td></tr><tr><td>Net finance lease receivables</td><td>176</td><td>80</td><td>186</td><td>81</td></tr><tr><td>Plus short-term portion of finance lease receivables in liability position</td><td>-</td><td>1</td><td>-</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Total finance lease receivables</td><td>176</td><td>81</td><td>186</td><td>83</td></tr><tr><td>Less unearned finance income</td><td>(95)</td><td>-</td><td>(103)</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Present value of finance lease receivables</td><td>81</td><td>81</td><td>83</td><td>83</td></tr><tr><td>Short-term finance lease receivables</td><td></td><td>6</td><td></td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Long-term finance lease receivables</td><td></td><td>75</td><td></td><td>74</td></tr></table>

1 Included within the discounted balance as at 30 June 2024 are  $5 million sublease receivable assets, offset by a$ 1 million liability relating to the Chorus finance lease receivable (30 June 2023: $9 million sublease receivable asset, offset by a $2 million liability relating to the Chorus finance lease receivable).

The lease with Chorus, where Spark is the lessor, has multiple rights of renewals and the full lease term has been used in the majority of the calculation of the financial lease receivable at lease inception, as it was likely that because of the specialised nature of the buildings, the lease would be renewed to the maximum term.

Spark holds a  $10 \%$ interest in Hutchison Telecommunications Australia Limited (Hutchison), which is quoted on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) and its fair value is measured using the observable bid share price as quoted on the ASX, classified as being within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. As at 30 June 2024 the quoted price of Hutchison’s shares on the ASX was AU $\$ 0$ .028 (30 June 2023: AU $\$ 0$ .042). The decrease in fair value of $20 million is recognised in other comprehensive income (30 June 2023: $44 million decrease).

Included within investment in associates and joint ventures is  $71 million (30 June 2023:$ 85 million) for Spark's investment in the Connexa group.

# Investment in associates and joint ventures

Spark's investment in associates and joint ventures at 30 June 2024 consists of the following:

Spark has suspended equity accounting for Pacific Carriage Holdings Limited Inc and Southern Cross Cables Holdings Limited (together 'Southern Cross') as their carrying values were reduced to nil. Spark has no obligation to fund Southern Cross deficits or repay dividends. For the year ended 30 June 2024, Spark's share of Southern Cross profits was not recognised because of the existence of historic cumulative Southern Cross deficits. In the current year Southern Cross profit was  $46 million (30 June 2023:$ 34 million).

1 Remeasurements to property in FY24 and FY23 primarily relate to modifications for corporate property leases. The reduction in property right-of-use assets for corporate property leases is substantially offset by a reduction in property lease liabilities (see note 4.2).  
2 Relates to right-of-use assets that were held for sale as at 30 June 2022 but not sold as part of the Connexa transaction and therefore transferred back to right-of-use assets.

All capacity additions for the years ended 30 June 2024 and 30 June 2023 were fully paid on control being obtained and therefore deemed capital expenditure as defined and reconciled in note 2.5.

Income from subleasing right-of-use assets for the year ended 30 June 2024 was  $2 million (30 June 2023:$ 2 million).

# 3.4 Right-of-use assets (continued)

# Key estimates and assumptions

At inception of a contract Spark assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, Spark assesses whether:

- The contract involves the use of an identified asset  
- Spark has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset throughout the period of use  
- Spark has the right to direct the use of the asset

At inception or on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, Spark allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices. Spark recognises a right-of-use asset at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.

The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically assessed for impairment losses and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.

# 3.5 Leased customer equipment assets

Spark acts as the intermediate party (as a lessee and a lessor) in a number of lease arrangements for customer premises equipment. Such arrangements may also include an initial sale and leaseback transaction. A sale and leaseback transaction contains a genuine sale if control of an asset is transferred under NZ IFRS 15. For Spark's back-to-back lease arrangements we have assessed that a sale does not occur, as control over the equipment remains with Spark instead of passing to the buyer-lessor. Spark also acts as a lessor, where there is no intermediate party, for customer premises equipment.

Spark as the seller-lessee or lessor (when the lease is an operating lease) continues to recognise the leased customer equipment asset, which is initially measured at cost. The asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method based on the expected lease term. Movements in leased customer equipment assets are summarised below:

<table><tr><td>YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE</td><td>NOTES</td><td>2024
$M</td><td>2023
$M</td></tr><tr><td>Opening net book value</td><td></td><td>77</td><td>90</td></tr><tr><td>Additions</td><td></td><td>32</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>Transferred to right-of-use assets</td><td>3.4</td><td>(8)</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Transferred from contract costs</td><td>3.1</td><td>4</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Disposals</td><td></td><td>(2)</td><td>(9)</td></tr><tr><td>Depreciation charge</td><td></td><td>(33)</td><td>(36)</td></tr><tr><td>Closing net book value</td><td></td><td>70</td><td>77</td></tr><tr><td>AS AT 30 JUNE</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cost</td><td></td><td>205</td><td>216</td></tr><tr><td>Accumulated depreciation and impairment losses</td><td></td><td>(135)</td><td>(139)</td></tr><tr><td>Closing net book value</td><td></td><td>70</td><td>77</td></tr></table>

Leased customer equipment assets are leased to customers under operating leases. Revenue received from these arrangements and other operating leases for the year ended 30 June 2024 were  $50 million (30 June 2023:$ 50 million).

# 3.6 Property, plant and equipment (continued)

# Joint arrangement

Spark has a joint arrangement relating to the construction and operation of the Tasman Global Access fibre-optic submarine cable between Australia and New Zealand. As at 30 June 2024, the carrying value of Spark's share of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and capacity right-of-use assets in the joint operation was $31 million (30 June 2023: $30 million).

# Key estimates and assumptions

Spark's property, plant and equipment is measured at cost and depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis over the assets' estimated useful lives. Determining the appropriate useful life of property, plant and equipment requires Management judgement, including the expected period of service potential, the likelihood technological advances will make the asset obsolete, the likelihood of Spark ceasing to use it and the effect of government regulation.

The estimated useful lives of Spark's property, plant and equipment are as follows:

# Telecommunications equipment

<table><tr><td>Links and cables</td><td>9 - 50 years</td></tr><tr><td>Network transport</td><td>2 - 15 years</td></tr><tr><td>Mobile radio access network</td><td>5 - 25 years</td></tr><tr><td>Customer premises equipment</td><td>3 - 5 years</td></tr><tr><td>International cable and satellite</td><td>10 - 15 years</td></tr></table>

# Other

<table><tr><td>Motor vehicles</td><td>6 years</td></tr><tr><td>Computer equipment</td><td>2 - 8 years</td></tr><tr><td>Internal IT system assets</td><td>3 - 15 years</td></tr></table>

The assessment of assets for impairment is based on a large number of factors, such as changes in current competitive conditions, expectations of growth in the telecommunications industry, the discontinuance of services, the expected future cash flows an asset is expected to generate and other changes in circumstances that indicate an impairment exists. Key judgements include rates of expected revenue growth or decline, expected future margins and the selection of an appropriate discount rate for valuing future cash flows.

# Key estimates and assumptions

Intangible assets are amortised over their useful lives on a straight-line basis, except goodwill, which is tested for impairment annually. Determining the appropriate useful life of an intangible asset requires Management judgement, including assessing the expected period of service potential, the likelihood technological advances will make it obsolete and the likelihood of Spark ceasing to use it.

The estimated useful lives of Spark's intangible assets are as follows:

Spectrum licences 2-21 years

Software 2-16 years

Customer contracts and brands 5-10 years

Other intangible assets 2-100 years

# 3.7 Intangible assets (continued)

# Goodwill

Goodwill by cash-generating unit (CGU) is presented below:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">AS AT 30 JUNE</td><td>2024</td><td>2023¹</td></tr><tr><td>$M</td><td>$M</td></tr><tr><td>Mobile</td><td>34</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td>Broadband</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>IT Products</td><td>117</td><td>117</td></tr><tr><td>IT Services</td><td>53</td><td>53</td></tr><tr><td>High-tech</td><td>20</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Digital Island</td><td>17</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>244</td><td>234</td></tr></table>

1 Spark changed its cash-generating units from 1 July 2023 in line with the changes in Spark's segment reporting as outlined in note 2.1, the 2023 comparative has been restated to align with the updated CGUs.

On 19 October 2023, Spark increased its holding in its investment in associate, Adroit Holdings Limited, an environmental IoT solutions company, from  $47\%$  to  $100\%$  making it a wholly owned subsidiary. Goodwill recognised from the acquisition of $6 million has been allocated to the High-tech CGU as this is the CGU that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the transaction.

In addition, on 31 January 2024, Spark's subsidiary, Digital Island purchased  $100\%$  of the ordinary share capital of Circle Investments Limited, goodwill of $4 million was recognised on acquisition and has been allocated to the Digital Island CGU.

During the years ended 30 June 2024 and 30 June 2023 no impairment arose as a result of the assessment of the carrying value of goodwill. Headroom currently exists in each CGU and, based on the sensitivity analysis performed, no reasonably possible changes in the assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the CGUs to exceed their recoverable amounts.

# Key estimates and assumptions

Goodwill is assessed annually for impairment using a value-in-use model, which estimates the future cash flows, based on the FY25 Board-approved business plan, applied to the next three years, with key assumptions being forecast earnings and capital expenditure for each CGU. The forecast financial information is based on both past experience and future expectations of CGU performance. The major inputs and assumptions used in performing an impairment assessment that require judgement include revenue forecasts, operating cost projections, customer numbers and customer churn, discount rates, growth rates and future technology paths.

Nil terminal growth was applied to all CGUs and a pre-tax discount rate of  $11.3\%$  was utilised for the year ended 30 June 2024 (30 June 2023:  $11.7\%$ ).

# 3.8 Net tangible assets

The calculation of Spark's net tangible assets per share and its reconciliation to the statement of financial position is presented below:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">AS AT 30 JUNE</td><td>2024</td><td>2023</td></tr><tr><td>$M</td><td>$M</td></tr><tr><td>Total assets</td><td>4,635</td><td>4,482</td></tr><tr><td>Less: intangible assets</td><td>(851)</td><td>(806)</td></tr><tr><td>Less: total liabilities</td><td>(3,045)</td><td>(2,542)</td></tr><tr><td>Net tangible assets</td><td>739</td><td>1,134</td></tr><tr><td>Number of shares outstanding (in millions)</td><td>1,814</td><td>1,845</td></tr><tr><td>Net tangible assets per share</td><td>$0.41</td><td>$0.61</td></tr></table>

Net tangible assets per share is a non-GAAP financial measure that is not defined in NZ IFRS. Total assets include assets held for sale and right-of-use assets. Total liabilities include lease liabilities. Net tangible assets per share declined by  $0.20 per share from 30 June 2023 as the prior year calculation was high due to lower debt levels following the sale of the Connexa business. The FY24 calculation was more aligned to the FY22 net tangible assets per share calculation of$ 0.34.

1 Remeasurements in FY24 and FY23 primarily relate to modifications for corporate property leases and mobile sites. For corporate properties, the reduction in lease liabilities is substantially offset by a reduction in property right-of-use assets (see note 3.4). For mobile site remeasurements there is not a corresponding adjustment in right-of-use assets as the majority of these adjustments relate to Connexa leases which have a smaller right-of-use asset due to the sale and leaseback transaction.  
2 Relates to the discounted lease liability for future minimum rental commitments for non-cancellable periods of leases, excluding rights of renewal, which are at Spark's option, including leases committed to that have not yet commenced.  
3 Relates to lease liabilities that were held for sale as at 30 June 2022, but either assigned or, not sold as part of the Connexa transaction and therefore transferred back to lease liabilities.

# 4.2 Lease liabilities (continued)

# Key estimates and assumptions

Spark recognises a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, Spark's incremental borrowing rate. Generally, Spark uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate, with adjustments for the type and term of the lease.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise:

- Fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments  
Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date  
- Amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee  
- The exercise price under a purchase option that Spark is reasonably certain to exercise  
- Lease payments in an optional renewal period if Spark is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option

The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in Spark's estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee or if Spark changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase or extension option.

When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset or it is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.

Spark has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have lease terms of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. Spark recognises the lease payments associated with these leases within operating expenses on a straight-line basis over their lease terms.

# 4.3 Debt

Debt is initially recognised at fair value less attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, debt is classified and measured at amortised cost plus, for hedged liabilities that are in a fair value hedging relationship, adjustments for fair value changes attributable to the risk being hedged. Any difference between cost and redemption value (including fair value changes) is recognised in the statement of profit or loss over the period of the borrowings, using the effective interest rate method.

 1 With respect to arrangements with outstanding liabilities at 30 June 2024, including those entered into in prior years, financing providers have paid suppliers a total of $124 million and Spark has made payments against these arrangements of $54 million, resulting in a closing liability of $70 million as at 30 June 2024. Amounts paid under these arrangements are presented in the statement of cash flows within financing activities. (30 June 2023: financers have paid suppliers $30 million, payments of $21 million have been made by Spark, resulting in a closing liability of $9 million).

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: LIABILITIES AND EQUITY

# 4.3 Debt (continued)

None of Spark's debt is secured and all debt ranks equally with other liabilities. There are no financial covenants over Spark's debt, however, there are certain triggers in the event of default, as defined in the various debt agreements. There have been no events of default over Spark's debt in the years ended 30 June 2024 and 30 June 2023.

The fair value of total debt based on market observable prices was  $1,635 million compared to a carrying value of$ 1,619 million as at 30 June 2024 (30 June 2023: fair value of $1,063 million compared to a carrying value of $1,052 million).

# 4.4 Capital risk management

Spark manages its capital considering shareholders' interests, the value of Spark's assets and the Company's credit rating. The Board is committed to the Company maintaining an investment grade rating and its capital management policies are designed to ensure this objective is met. As part of this commitment, and in line with credit rating metrics, Spark currently manages its debt levels to ensure that the ratio of adjusted net debt at hedged rates (being inclusive of associated derivatives and leases) to adjusted EBITDAI does not exceed 1.7 times on a long-run basis. At 30 June 2024, Spark's net debt to EBITDAI (including lease liabilities) ratio was  $2.1\mathrm{x}$ , temporarily exceeding the  $1.7\mathrm{x}$  metric. Management remains committed to ensuring net debt to EBITDAI does not exceed  $1.7\mathrm{x}$  on a long-run basis.

As at 30 June 2024, the Company's S&P Global credit ratings for long-term and short-term debt was, respectively, A- and A-2 with outlook stable (30 June 2023: same).

Spark's derivatives are held at fair value, calculated using discounted cash flow models and observable market rates of interest and foreign exchange prices. This represents a level two measurement under the fair value measurement hierarchy, being inputs other than quoted prices included within level one that are observable for the asset or liability. As at 30 June 2024 and 30 June 2023 no derivative financial assets or derivative financial liabilities have been offset in the statement of financial position. The potential for offsetting of any derivative financial instruments is $11 million (30 June 2023: $13 million), which if applied would result in a reduction of derivative assets and derivative liabilities.

# Hedge accounting

Derivatives are hedge accounted when they are designated into an effective hedge relationship as a hedging instrument. The nature and the effectiveness of the hedge accounting relationship will determine where the gains and losses on remeasurement are recognised. Derivatives are designated as:

- Fair value hedges, where the derivative is used to manage interest rate risk in relation to debt  
Cash flow hedges, where the derivative is used to manage the variability in cash flows of highly probable forecast transactions  
- Dual fair value and cash flow hedges, where the derivative is used to hedge the interest rate risk on foreign debt and the variability in cash flows due to movements in foreign exchange rates.

At inception, each hedge relationship is formalised in hedge documentation. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedge instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Spark determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of respective cash flows, reference interest rates, tenors (time to maturity), repricing dates, maturities and notional amounts. Spark assesses whether the derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be, and has been, effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method.

Derivatives in hedge relationships are designated based on a hedge ratio of 1:1. In these hedge relationships the main source of ineffectiveness is the effect of the counterparty and Spark's own credit risk on the fair value of the derivatives, which is not reflected in the change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to changes in foreign exchange and interest rates.

# Cash flow hedges

Cross-currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps are jointly designated in cash flow hedges to manage interest and foreign exchange rate risk on debt. The hedged cash flows will affect Spark's statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as interest and principal amounts are repaid over the remaining term of the debt.

Interest rate swaps are designated in cash flow hedges to manage the interest rate exposure of highly probable forecast variable rate debt and aggregate variable interest rate exposures created by swapping local or foreign currency floating-rate (variable) debt into fixed-rate debt.

Spark also enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge forecast foreign currency purchases, the majority expected to be made within 12 months. The related cash flows are recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income over this period.

Included within the closing balance at 30 June 2024 is  $4 million relating to the cost of hedging reserve (30 June 2023:$ 4 million). The movement in the hedge reserves includes  $1 million for forward foreign exchange contracts (30 June 2023:$ 8 million in the change in fair value of interest rate swaps less $2 million associated deferred tax and $3 million for forward foreign exchange contracts).

# Fair value hedges

Interest rate swaps are designated in a fair value hedge to manage interest rate risk in relation to debt. The gain or loss from remeasuring the interest rate swaps and debt at fair value is recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. During the year ended 30 June 2024, there has been no material ineffectiveness on fair value hedging relationships (30 June 2023: no material ineffectiveness) and as a result, no material changes have been recognised in profit and loss.

# Dual fair value and cash flow hedges

As part of Spark's risk management policy, cross-currency interest rate swaps (CCIRSs) are entered into to convert all of the proceeds of the debt issuances to New Zealand dollars and convert the foreign currency fixed rate of the debt issuance to a New Zealand dollar floating rate. To mitigate profit or loss volatility, the CCIRSs were designated into a dual fair value and cash flow hedge relationship. The foreign currency basis element of the CCIRSs are excluded from the designation and are separately recognised in other comprehensive income in a cost of hedging reserve.

For fair value hedges, the gain or loss from remeasuring the CCIRSs and debt at fair value is recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. For cash flow hedges, gains or losses deferred in the cash flow hedge reserve will be reclassified to Spark's statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as interest and principal amounts are repaid over the remaining term of the debt.

The change in fair value of the hedging instruments relating to the foreign currency basis component of the CCIRSs are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a cost of hedging equity reserve. Subsequently, the cumulative amount is transferred to profit or loss at the same time as the hedged item impacts profit or loss.

# 5.2 Financial risk management

# a) Market risk

Spark is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Spark employs risk management strategies, including the use of derivative financial instruments, to manage these exposures through a Board-approved treasury policy, which provides the framework within which treasury-related activities are conducted.

Spark manages the concentration of exposures using well-defined market and credit risk limits and through timely reporting to senior management. All contracts have been entered into with high-credit quality financial institutions. The risk associated with these transactions is that the fair value or cash flows of financial instruments will change due to movements in market rates or, in the case of default by a counterparty, through the cost of replacement at the current market rates.

# Currency risk

# Nature of the risk

Currency risk is the risk that eventual New Zealand dollar net cash flows from transactions undertaken by Spark will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

# Exposure and risk management

Spark's total net exposure (from non-derivative financial instruments) to foreign currency as at 30 June 2024 is  $565 million (30 June 2023:$ 553 million). This includes $154 million long-term debt principal denominated in NOK (30 June 2023: $152 million) and $411 million long-term debt principal denominated in AUD (30 June 2023: $408 million). The remaining exposure is primarily trade payables and other receivables denominated in United States dollars (USD).

Spark manages currency risk arising from foreign currency debt through hedging. Spark's long-term debt issued in NOK and AUD is fully hedged using cross-currency interest rate swaps to convert foreign currency cashflows into floating-rate New Zealand dollar exposures.

Currency risk from capital and operational expenditure in foreign currencies (and related trade payables) has been substantially hedged by entering into forward exchange contracts.

# Sensitivity to foreign currency movements

As at 30 June 2024, a movement of  $10\%$  in the New Zealand dollar would (after hedging) impact the statement of profit or loss by less than  $\$ 1$  million (30 June 2023: less than  $\$ 1$  million) and the statement of changes in equity by less than  $\$ 13$  million (30 June 2023: less than  $\$ 11$  million). This analysis assumes a movement in the New Zealand dollar across all currencies and only includes the effect of foreign exchange movements on monetary financial instruments.

# Interest rate risk

# Nature of the risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that fluctuations in interest rates impact Spark's cash flows, financial performance or the fair value of its holdings of financial instruments.

# Exposure and risk management

Spark is exposed to interest rate risk from its financing activities, which primarily include loans and debt issuance either at fixed or floating rates. For floating-rate exposures Spark employs the use of derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, with the objective to minimise the cost of net borrowings and to minimise the impact of interest rate movements on interest expense and net earnings.

Cross-currency interest rate swaps are used to convert foreign currency debt into floating-rate New Zealand dollar exposures. Interest rate swaps are used to convert floating-rate exposures into fixed-rate exposures and vice versa. As a result, Spark's interest rate exposure is limited to New Zealand only.

# Sensitivity to interest rate movements

As at 30 June 2024, a movement in interest rates of 25 basis points would (after hedging) impact the statement of profit or loss by less than  $1 million (30 June 2023: less than$ 1 million) and the statement of changes in equity by less than $5 million (30 June 2023: less than $1 million).

# 5.2 Financial risk management (continued)

# b) Credit risk

# Nature of the risk

Credit risk arises in the normal course of Spark's business on cash, receivables and derivative financial instruments if a counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations.

# Exposure and risk management

Spark is exposed to credit risk if customers and counterparties fail to make payments in respect of:

- Payment of trade and other receivables as they fall due; and  
- Contractual cash flows of derivative assets held at fair value.

Spark's assets subject to credit risk as at 30 June 2024 were  $1,314 million (30 June 2023:$ 1,299 million).

Spark considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of cash, receivables and derivative assets and whether there has been a significant and ongoing increase in credit risk at the end of each reporting period. To assess this Spark compares the risk of default occurring on these assets at the reporting date, with the risk of default at the date of initial recognition. Available, reasonable and supportive forward-looking information is considered, especially the following indicators:

- External credit rating (as far as available)  
- Actual or expected significant adverse changes in business, financial or economic conditions that are expected to cause a significant change to the customer or counterparty's ability to meet their obligations  
- Significant changes in the value of the collateral supporting the obligation or in the quality of third-party guarantees or credit enhancements.

Spark considers a financial asset to have low credit risk when the asset is held with a high-credit quality financial institution or with a party that has a strong financial position with no past due amounts.

Spark manages its exposure using a credit policy that includes limits on exposures with significant counterparties that have been set and approved by the Board and are monitored on a regular basis. Spark places its cash and derivative financial instruments with high-credit quality financial institutions and does not have significant concentration of risk with any single financial institution. Spark has significant shareholder loans and finance lease receivables which are deemed low credit risk. Concentration of credit risk for trade and other receivables is limited because of Spark's large customer base.

Spark has certain derivatives and debt arrangements that are subject to bilateral credit support agreements that require Spark or its counterparties to post collateral funds to support the value of certain derivatives subject to certain agreed threshold amounts. As at 30 June 2024, no collateral was posted (30 June 2023: nil).

Letters of credit and guarantees may be held over some receivable amounts. The carrying amounts of financial assets represent the maximum credit exposure.

# c) Liquidity risk

# Nature of the risk

Liquidity risk represents Spark's ability to meet its contractual obligations as they fall due.

# Exposure and risk management

Spark uses cash and derivative financial instruments to manage liquidity and evaluates its liquidity requirements on an ongoing basis. In general, Spark generates sufficient cash flows from its operating activities to meet its financial liabilities. As at 30 June 2024, Spark had current assets of  $1,070 million and current liabilities of$ 1,060 million (30 June 2023: current assets of $1,079 million and current liabilities of $850 million). Positive operating cash flows enable working capital to be managed to meet short-term liabilities as they fall due.

In the event of any shortfalls Spark has the following financing programmes:

- An undrawn committed standby facility of  $200 million with a number of creditworthy banks (30 June 2023:$ 200 million)  
- Committed bank facilities of  $525 million with$ 310 million drawn as at 30 June 2024 (30 June 2023: $425 million facilities with $115 million drawn)  
- Undrawn committed bank overdraft facilities of  $15 million with New Zealand banks (30 June 2023:$ 15 million).

There are no compensating balance requirements associated with these facilities.

Spark's liquidity policy is to maintain unutilised committed facilities of at least  $110\%$  of the next 12 months' forecast peak net funding requirements, including coverage for short-term capital market issues. Spark's funding policy requires that no more than  $30\%$  of long-term debt (including undrawn and standby facilities) can mature within the next 12 months, which has been met.

2 Due to the difference between the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities recognised at the date of the sale of Connexa in the prior year, a deferred tax asset of  $126 million was recognised in FY23, with a corresponding adjustment (reduction) to tax expense. The balance of the deferred tax asset at 30 June 2023 was$ 124 million. The Spark Sport provision had a deferred tax impact at 30 June 2023 of $12 million. The current tax impact of adjusting items of $31 million together with the deferred income tax impact of $137 million is $168 million (see note 2.5). The total tax expense on an adjusted (non-GAAP) basis for FY23 was $185 million.  
1 In the prior year this comprised the tax effect of the  $583 million net gain on sale of Connexa, being$ 163 million, the $126 million deferred tax impact described above and the $26 million current tax impact of the costs associated with the assets disposed of and other adjustments of $2 million.  
2 The comparative includes the tax effect of the net gain on sale of Connexa and the Spark Sport provision, being a credit to tax of  $168 million (see note 2.5). The total tax expense on an adjusted (non-GAAP) basis for FY23 was$ 185 million.

# 6.1 Income tax (continued)

# Tax depreciation on buildings

As announced as part of their election campaign, the Government enacted legislation to remove the tax depreciation on commercial and industrial buildings, effective from income tax years on or after 1 April 2024. This reduces the tax base of the building assets back to nil because depreciation can no longer be claimed on these assets from FY25 onwards. As deferred tax is calculated on the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its tax base, the decrease of the tax base has reduced Spark's deferred tax asset by $26 million. This also results in a one-off increase in tax expense of $26 million.

# Pillar Two legislation

The OECD model GloBE rules, first released by the OECD in December 2021, are intended to ensure that large multinational enterprises (MNE) with annual revenue of €750m or more pay a minimum level of tax (based on an effective tax rate of 15%) on income arising in each country where they operate.

Spark is an 'in-scope' MNE under the GloBE rules due to its scale in New Zealand (where its Ultimate Parent Entity (UPE) is located) combined with its small international footprint of constituent entities (CE).

The rules are complex with different adoption and implementation dates applying in different countries meaning the transformation of the international tax environment will continue unabated for some time. Spark has undertaken an initial impact assessment and has determined that the rules do not apply in relation to its financial year ended 30 June 2024. Spark expects GloBE reporting obligations to apply to its 30 June 2025 financial year (in respect of its CE's in Australia and the United Kingdom). Additional GloBE reporting is expected to commence in other regions in relation to Spark's 2026 financial year. However, no top up taxes are expected to be paid due to the availability of certain temporary safe harbours that apply through to 2028.

1 Amounts relating to the current period for the comparative include timing differences for the Connexa lease and the Spark Sport provision.  
2 In the prior year, adjustments in respect of prior periods reflect changes in the prior year tax balances used for financial reporting and tax return completion, in the current year these primarily relate to reclassifications between categories to align with the current year's presentation.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: OTHER INFORMATION

# 6.1 Income tax (continued)

Spark has not recognised the tax effect of accumulated unrestricted losses and temporary differences amounting to AU$461 million at 30 June 2024 based on the relevant corporation tax rate of Australia (30 June 2023: AU$461 million). These losses and temporary differences may be available to be carried forward to offset against future taxable income. However, utilisation is contingent on the production of taxable profits over a significant period of time and is subject to compliance with the relevant taxation authority requirements.

Spark has a negative 67 million imputation credit account balance as at 30 June 2024 due to the timing of dividend and tax payments (30 June 2023: negative 32 million). The imputation credit account had a positive balance as at 31 March 2024.

# 6.2 Employee share schemes

Spark operates a share-based compensation plan that is equity settled as outlined below.

# Share option scheme

From September 2019, members of the Leadership Squad (including the CEO) and selected senior leaders have been granted options under the new Spark Long-Term Incentive (LTI) scheme. Under the scheme participants are granted options at the start of the three-year vesting period. The number of options granted equals the gross LTI value divided by the volume weighted average price of Spark New Zealand shares for the 20 days prior to the grant date. Subject to satisfaction of the performance hurdle and continued employment, at vesting each option converts to a Spark share based on a zero exercise price. If the target is not met (or the participant leaves Spark employment) then the options simply lapse, with exceptions for redundancy, death and disablement. Spark enables participants to meet tax obligations through PAYE by authorising the sale of a sufficient number of shares on their behalf.

Vesting of the LTI grants are contingent on participants' continued employment with Spark for three years from grant date (subject to exceptions) and the Company achieving the specified performance hurdles. The performance hurdle targets are set annually and for grants issued in 2020 and 2021 this was the Company's cost of equity plus  $1\%$  compounding annually. For grants issued in 2022 and 2023,  $75\%$  of the allocated shares will vest based on the performance hurdle target of the Company's cost of equity plus  $1.5\%$  compounding annually and  $25\%$  will vest based on performance against environmental and diversity targets. Options with an intrinsic value of $13 million (30 June 2023: $15 million) remain outstanding at 30 June 2024 and have a weighted average remaining life of 1.3 years (30 June 2023: 1.3 years).

# Deloitte.

# Independent auditor's report

# To the Shareholders of Spark New Zealand Limited

# Opinion

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Spark New Zealand Limited and its subsidiaries (the 'Group'), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2024, and the consolidated statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including material accounting policy information.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements, on pages 106 to 151, present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 30 June 2024, and its consolidated financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with New Zealand Equivalents to IFRS Accounting Standards ('NZ IFRS') as issued by the External Reporting Board and IFRS Accounting Standards ('IFRS') as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board

# Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing ('ISAs') and International Standards on Auditing (New Zealand) ('ISAs (NZ)'). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

We are independent of the Group in accordance with Professional and Ethical Standard 1 International Code of Ethics for Assurance Practitioners (including International Independence Standards) (New Zealand) issued by the New Zealand Auditing and Assurance Standards Board and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

Our firm carries out other assignments for Spark New Zealand Limited in relation to regulatory audit requirements, other assurance related services (such as trustee reporting, Greenhouse Gas Emissions limited assurance and agreed upon procedures in relation to the sustainability-linked loans) and non-assurance services provided to the Corporate Taxpayers Group, of which the Group is a member. These services have not impaired our independence as auditor of the Company and Group. In addition to this, the Chief Executive has both a sister and brother-in-law that are partners at Deloitte. These Deloitte partners are not involved in the provision of any services to the Group and its subsidiaries, and this matter has not impacted our independence. Also, partners and employees of our firm deal with the Group on normal terms within the ordinary course of trading activities of the business of the Company and its subsidiaries. The firm has no other relationship with, or interest in, the Group.

# Audit materiality

We consider materiality primarily in terms of the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements of the Group that in our judgement would make it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced (the 'quantitative' materiality). In addition, we also assess whether other matters that come to our attention during the audit would in our judgement change or influence the decisions of such a person (the 'qualitative' materiality). We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.

# Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

# Key audit matter

# Revenue recognition

The Group recognised total revenues excluding other gains of  $3,759m (2023:$ 3,875m) including:

- Mobile  $1,474m (2023:$  1,470m)  
- Broadband  $613m (2023:$ 626m)  
- Procurement and partners \( \\( {548}\mathrm{\;m} \) (2023: \( \$ {584}\mathrm{\;m} \) )  
Voice $180m (2023: $231m)  
- IT products $527m (2023: $509m)  
- IT services  $165m (2023:$ 194m)  
 High-tech $79m (2023: $$65m)  
 Data centres $37m (2023: $24m)  
- Other operating revenues  $136m (2023:$ 172m)

Revenue recognition is considered to be a key audit matter.

For Mobile and Broadband revenue, and to a lesser extent other revenue streams, there is an inherent risk around the accuracy and timing of revenue recognition given the complexity of systems and the large volume of data processed; moreover, judgement is required for multiple element arrangements. This risk is most pronounced for new or changing product plans and prices.

IT products and IT services require significant management judgements and estimates, particularly for larger contracts, which are bespoke and cover several accounting periods.

The judgements and estimates that significantly impact the accuracy of revenue recognition for these contracts include:

- identifying the separate performance obligations;  
- assessing whether the performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time or over time; and  
- determining the amount and appropriate method of measuring the costs of fulfilling the performance obligations or, where appropriate, the completeness and valuation of provisions against contracts that are expected to be loss-making.

Disclosures relating to revenue recognition and the revenue stream breakdown can be found in Note 2.2. Operating revenues and other gains.

# How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Our audit approach included both controls testing and substantive procedures. For our procedures on the design and operating effectiveness of controls over significant IT systems, we involved our IT specialists.

Our audit procedures included:

Across Mobile, Voice and Broadband, and IT products and IT services revenue streams:

- Assessing the appropriateness of the revenue recognition policies for the products and services offered by the Group, which included but were not limited to:

- challenging the Group's assessment for each performance obligation about whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with readily available resources;

- assessing the allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations by comparing the stand-alone selling price assigned to observed market prices or estimated prices; and

- examining the stages at which revenue for each performance obligation is recognised.

# Mobile, Voice and Broadband:

- testing the design and implementation, and the operating effectiveness of automated controls and interfaces between relevant IT applications, measurement and billing of revenue, and the recording of entries in the general ledger. We also tested the access controls and change management controls over the relevant billing systems;  
- testing the design and implementation, and the operating effectiveness of manual controls over the initiation, authorisation, recording and processing of revenue transactions. This included evaluating process controls over authorising new price plans and rate changes and the adjustments to the relevant billing systems;  
- testing the design and implementation of revenue recognition controls, including rating and billing during the year as it relates to new or changing product plans;  
- recalculating revenue recognised to evaluate that the processing by the relevant telecommunication system is materially correct;  
- reviewing new product plans in the current year to understand each of the performance obligations in the bundled offering;  
- for new product plans that provide a bundle of services, assessing whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with readily available resources; and  
- assessing the recognition and timing of costs to acquire and costs to fulfil customer contracts.

<table><tr><td>Key audit matter</td><td>How our audit addressed the key audit matter</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>IT products and IT services: 
· testing IT products and IT services contracts for appropriate revenue recognition and provisioning for contracts that were expected to be loss-making. We considered the future forecast profitability and the contractual terms to assess the recoverability of the contract-specific assets and to determine whether any contracts required loss provisions; and 
· testing a sample of revenue transactions recorded during the year by agreeing to supporting evidence, which included cash receipts, customer contracts, and invoices. We focussed our work on contracts which we regarded as higher risk because of the nature of the contract and the stage of delivery.</td></tr><tr><td>Carrying value of property, plant &amp; equipment and intangible assets
The Group has property, plant &amp; equipment of $1,394m (2023: $1,264m) and intangible assets excluding goodwill of $607m (2023: $572m). 
There are a number of areas where judgements significantly impact the carrying value of property, plant &amp; equipment and intangible assets excluding goodwill, and their respective depreciation and amortisation profiles. These areas are as follows: 
· the impact of planned or unexpected replacement technology which will impact the way in which an asset is used or is expected to be used; 
· the determination whether to capitalise or expense costs, particularly for capitalised labour; 
· the useful economic life of the asset; and 
· the timely transfer and commencement of depreciation of assets transferred from work in progress. 
Changes in these judgements may have a significant impact on the results of the Group. Due to the significance of these judgements and the materiality of these assets to the Group's Statement of Financial Position, this is considered a key audit matter. 
Refer to Notes 3.6 Property, plant and equipment and 3.7 Intangible assets.</td><td>· Our audit procedures included the following: 
· testing of the design and implementation of controls over the acquisition and disposal of assets; 
· assessing the appropriateness of capitalisation of costs incurred on capital projects, by examining a sample of additions to identify whether the expenditure meets the definition of an asset in accordance with the applicable accounting standards; 
· assessing the reasonableness of the internal labour rates used to capitalise internal labour; 
· assessing the appropriateness of the date from which assets commenced being depreciated; 
· assessing the application of the Group's annual asset life review. This included assessing judgements made by the Group on: 
· the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation and amortisation; 
· the nature and impact of changes on the business from Spark's strategy, including which specific assets are impacted; and 
· the extent of the impact of these changes on the carrying value of identified property, plant and equipment and software intangible assets. 
· It also included: 
· assessing the allocated useful economic lives, by comparing to industry benchmarks and our knowledge of the business and its operations; and 
· reviewing Board minutes and performing enquiries with various management personnel around the prevailing risks of technological obsolescence and assessing their impact on the useful lives/impairment risk of existing assets.</td></tr><tr><td>Other information</td><td>The directors are responsible on behalf of the Group for the other information.

# Director independence

As part of the formal independence assessment, the Board considered all business relationships and close personal ties between Spark and any companies of which a non-executive director is an employee, director or substantial shareholder (if any). The Board has determined, based on information provided by directors regarding their interests, that at 30 June 2024 Ms Barrass, Mr Bray, Ms Broadbent, Mr MacLeod, Ms Nelson and Ms Smyth were independent. The Board (other than Ms Smyth) has considered the tenure of Ms Smyth who has been a Director for 12.7 years, and Chair for 5.9 years as at 30 June 2024. The Board determined that Ms Smyth's understanding of Spark and experience and skills in the industry add ongoing value to Spark. The Board are of the view that Ms Smyth's tenure does not interfere with her capacity to bring an independent judgment to bear on issues before the Board, to act in the best interests of Spark, and to represent the interests of its financial product holders generally.

The Board determined that Ms Hodson was not independent due to her position as CEO, and Mr Havercroft was not independent due to his prior relationships with Spark, which have now ceased.

The criteria for determining director independence and conflict of interest may be found in the Board Charter at: www.spark.co.nz/online/about/our-company/governance

All non-executive directors are expected to hold Spark shares. Subject to personal circumstances (that should be discussed with the Chair or, in the case of personal circumstances of the Chair, with the Chair of the ARMC, as appropriate), there is an expectation that each non-executive director will purchase and hold an amount of shares that are at least equivalent in value to the non-executive director base member fee as at the date of their appointment or, in the case of directors appointed before 1 July 2017, this was as at 1 July 2017. Shares are to be purchased within a three-year period from the date of appointment or, in the case of directors appointed before 1 July 2017, this was within a three-year period from that date. To assess whether this expectation has been met, the aggregate purchase price for all shares acquired, less the aggregate sale price for all shares disposed (if any), is used to calculate value.

# Sustainability appendix

As an integrated report we have included disclosure on our sustainability performance throughout this report. Pages 6 and 7 detail our integrated reporting value creation model, aligned to the 'capitals' which each have a dedicated section in the report.

This report is prepared in accordance with the International <IR> Framework and with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Core Option. It also incorporates climate-related disclosures that have been prepared in compliance with the Aotearoa New Zealand Climate Standards (NZ CS 1, NZ CS 2 and NZ CS 3) issued by the External Reporting Board (XRB).

We publish a summary of our approach to sustainability at Spark on our website. www.spark.co.nz/online/about/sustainability/

# Materiality

To prioritise Spark's reporting on sustainability topics we follow the GRI materiality principle and processes (set out in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021) to identify and prioritise topics which substantively influence the assessments and decisions of stakeholders or have a significant environmental, social, or economic impact. We also consider the materiality principles of the Integrated Reporting International <IR> Framework, considering whether a matter could substantively affect Spark's ability to create value in the short, medium, or long term.

We refresh our materiality analysis annually, as part of our integrated reporting process. Our assessment of material topics includes analysis of stakeholder feedback, review of industry peers, and interviews with external stakeholders. In previous years we have also engaged an external sustainability consultancy to independently review our materiality prioritisation. Internally we consult with a range of employees, including members of our strategy, finance, community, corporate relations, risk, legal, and HR teams, to determine Spark's view of topics meeting the GRI materiality principle criteria.

The purpose of our annual materiality review is to ensure we are capturing all topics that are material to our stakeholders, with a particular focus on identifying emerging topics. We have updated our materiality matrix for FY24. This reflects feedback from various stakeholders which has highlighted the increasing importance of data ethics, including data governance and sovereignty, with the increased profile and application of AI technologies. In the previous year changes included increasing the importance of disaster crisis response and the role of digital technology in addressing sustainability challenges.

These frequencies can carry massive amounts of data at very high speeds. That makes them ideal for accommodating the massive increase in data demanded from new 5G use cases such as augmented/virtual reality, cloud gaming, video analytics and other cloud-compute capabilities.</td></tr><tr><td>Multi-access edge computing (MAEC)</td><td>extends the capabilities of cloud computing by bringing it to the 'edge' of the network. While traditional cloud computing occurs on remote servers that are situated far from the customer and device, MAEC allows this processing to take place much closer to the end customer - meaning data has to travel a shorter distance, decreasing latency, and the amount of data sent across the network can be reduced, reducing congestion, and delivering a better customer experience.</td></tr><tr><td>Network slicing</td><td>allows the operator to 'slice' its network to support different types of services through each 'slice'. Multiple slices can be tuned independently to meet different quality of service parameters. For example, one slice may simply need a standard speed connection to enable office email, another might be tuned to support very low data Internet of Things devices, while another slice may need high reliability and ultra-low latency to support robotics.</td></tr><tr><td>NOMs</td><td>the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee.</td></tr><tr><td>NPS</td><td>Net Promoter Score.</td></tr><tr><td>NZ GAAP</td><td>Generally Accepted Accounting Practice in New Zealand.</td></tr><tr><td>NZ IAS</td><td>New Zealand International Accounting Standard.</td></tr><tr><td>NZ IFRS</td><td>New Zealand Equivalent to International Financial Reporting Standards.</td></tr><tr><td>NZX</td><td>NZX Limited.</td></tr><tr><td>OTN</td><td>Optical Transport Network (OTN) - the high speed backbone of Spark's network, stretching from the Far North to the bottom of the South Island.
