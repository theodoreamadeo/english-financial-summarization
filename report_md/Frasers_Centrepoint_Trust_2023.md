# Business Objectives and Growth Strategies

FCT is a real estate investment trust set up to own and invest in income-producing properties or properties that could be developed or redeveloped into income-producing properties, used primarily for retail purposes in Singapore and overseas.

FCT's objectives are to deliver regular and stable distributions to its Unitholders and to achieve long-term growth in its net asset value, so as to provide Unitholders with a competitive rate of return for their investments.

FCAM, the Manager of FCT, sets the strategic direction for FCT and this includes making recommendations to HSBC Institutional Trust Services (Singapore) Limited, as the Trustee of FCT, on acquisitions, divestments and enhancement of assets.

FCAM also oversees the overall management of FCT's portfolio of investment properties, including the capital and risk management.

FCT's growth strategies comprise three growth drivers - acquisition growth, enhancement growth and organic growth.

# Acquisition Growth

Identifying and pursuing growth opportunities via acquiring additional income-producing properties and properties that could be developed or redeveloped into income-producing properties. The acquisitions should meet FCT's investment objectives to enhance yields and returns for Unitholders while improving portfolio diversification. The acquisition opportunities include Sponsor's pipeline assets and third party assets in Singapore.

# Enhancement Growth

This includes change of configuration and layout of the properties to achieve better asset yield and sustainable income growth, and to achieve value creation through AEI to improve the income-producing capability of the properties.

# Organic Growth

Active lease management to achieve positive rental reversions and maintaining healthy portfolio occupancy to provide steady rental growth. FCAM adopts prudent capital and risk management strategies in its course of business.

# Capital Management

FCAM continues to maintain a prudent financial structure and adequate financial flexibility to ensure that it has access to capital resources at competitive cost.

FCAM proactively manages FCT's cash flows, financial position, debt maturity profile, cost of capital, interest rates exposure and overall liquidity position.

# Risk Management

Effective risk management is a fundamental part of FCT's business management. Key risks, mitigating measures and management actions are continually identified, reviewed and monitored by management as part of FCAM's enterprise-wide risk management framework.

Recognising and managing risks are central to the business and to protect Unitholders' interests.

# FY2023 Highlights

# Gross Revenue

# \$369.7 million

3.6% year-on-year

# Net Property Income

# $265.6 million

2.7% year-on-year

FCT achieved higher gross revenue and NPI of  $369.7 million and$ 265.6 million respectively in FY2023, as compared to FY2022. The growth was largely led by higher gross rental, increase in atrium income with the resumption of atrium events with effect from 29 March 2022, and property tax refunds received. It was partially offset by the lower gross revenue at Tampines 1 due to asset enhancement initiatives, higher maintenance and utility expenses, and higher staff costs.

# Distribution Per Unit

# 12.150 cents

0.6% year-on-year

DPU for FY2023 was 12.150 cents, which is  $0.6\%$  lower than the 12.227 cents in FY2022. The decrease was mainly attributed to higher interest expense and was cushioned by higher NPI and distributions from joint ventures.

# Net Asset Value and Net Tangible Asset Per Unit

# $2.32

0.4% year-on-year

FCT's NAV and NTA per unit as at 30 September 2023 stood at  $2.32 per unit² which was marginally lower than the NAV and NTA per unit of$ 2.33 per unit³ a year ago, primarily due to a larger base of total issued and issuable units.

# Appraised Value of Investment Property Portfolio

# $5,545.5 million

0.5% year-on-year

The total appraised value of FCT's investment property portfolio $^1$  as at 30 September 2023 stood at $5,545.5 million, stable as compared to $5,516.0 million a year ago.

# Aggregate Leverage

FCT's aggregate leverage stood at  $39.3\%^{4,5}$ as at 30 September 2023, which was higher than a year ago of  $33.0\%$ . The increase was mainly attributed to the acquisition of an additional  $10.00\%$  interest in SST and effective  $25.50\%$  interest in Gold Ridge Pte. Ltd. ("GRPL") which were fully debt funded.

1 Includes Changi City Point which was reclassified to "Assets held for sale" as at 30 September 2023.  
2 Includes the distribution to be paid for the second half of FY2023.  
3 Includes the distribution to be paid for the second half of FY2022.  
4 In accordance with Property Funds Appendix, the aggregate leverage included FCT's proportionate  $50.00\%$  effective interest in the deposited property value and borrowings in Sapphire Star Trust ("SST") which owns Waterway Point and the proportionate  $25.50\%$  effective interest in Gold Ridge Pte. Ltd. ("GRPL") which owns NEX.  
5 Assuming the net proceeds from the divestment of Changi City Point and interest in Hektar REIT are used to repay certain debts, the aggregate leverage on pro forma basis as at 30 September 2023 is expected to be reduced to  $36.1\%$ .

Under this green financing solution, proceeds from the green loan are used to refinance a maturing facility, finance asset enhancement initiatives and decarbonisation projects for FCT's Tampines 1 retail mall as well as other general corporate purposes.

The divestment is part of FCAM's strategic portfolio review to strengthen FCT's portfolio resilience and is in line with FCT's long-term objective to create value for its unitholders. The divestment will also strengthen FCT's financial position through the lowering of its aggregate leverage, a reduction in the average cost of borrowings and an improvement in the hedge ratio of fixed-rate loans from  $63\%$  to  $73\%$ , each on a pro forma basis. The divestment is also expected to increase the committed occupancy rate, average gross rent per sf, tenants' sales per sf and the average remaining lease tenure of FCT's retail portfolio.

# Unit Price Performance

# Unit Price and Total Return Performance in FY2023

The performance of the Singapore REIT sector, including FCT, continued to be hampered by the multiple increases in the Federal Funds Target Rates ("Fed Fund Rates") by the United States Federal Reserve (the "Fed") during the year under review. Within the period of October 2022 to September 2023, the Fed Fund Rates were raised six times from a range of  $3.00\%$  to  $3.25\%$  to  $5.25\%$  to  $5.50\%$ . The rate hikes as well as the commentaries from the Fed officials consequentially led to an increase in cost of borrowings, which in turn exerted downward pressure on and increased volatility in the unit price of interest rate-sensitive assets like REITs and bonds.

Please refer to the chart below on FCT's unit price performance versus the FTSE ST All-share Real Estate Investment Trust Index ("FTSE REIT Index") and the FTSE Straits Times Index ("STI Index") between 1 October 2022 and 29 September 2023 (last trading day of the month).

# Letter To Unitholders

![](images/1a381c431c693d98f01dec7fb21c773275940586dbf5e2a1a71a28f769cb5e2a.jpg)

# Date: 31 October 2023

# To: The Unitholders of Frasers Centrepoint Trust

# Dear Unitholders,

We are pleased to present Frasers Centrepoint Trust and its subsidiaries' ("FCT" and the "FCT Group") Annual Report and Sustainability Report for the financial year ended 30 September 2023 ("FY2023").

Over the past year, global investors, corporates, and individuals have endured an emotional rollercoaster ride, with markets oscillating between optimism for a cut in interest rates and the

disillusionment over successive rate increases by the U.S. Federal Reserve (the "Fed"). Based on the "higher for longer" narrative from the Fed, interest rates are expected to remain elevated in the near to mid-term and this will continue to exert pressure on financing costs and the prices of yield-sensitive assets like the REITs.

Despite the challenging macroeconomic environment where the cost of capital has surged and access to equity market became prohibitive, the Manager remained steadfast in its objective to deliver steady distribution returns to FCT and its Unitholders.

# Proactive Portfolio Re-constitution To Reinforce Market Position

During the year, FCT completed two acquisitions and made announcements for one asset enhancement initiative ("AEI") and two divestments. These transactions and AEI are strategic steps that enable FCT to recycle its capital effectively, bolster its financial position and portfolio strength while reinforcing its leading market position in the Singapore suburban retail sector.

# Acquisitions

The two acquisitions were the joint acquisition of a  $50.00\%$  interest in one of Singapore’s largest suburban malls - NEX - together with FCT’s sponsor Frasers Property Limited (“Frasers Property”), of which FCT’s effective interest is  $25.50\%$ ; and the acquisition of an additional  $10.00\%$  interest in Waterway Point that brought FCT’s total interest in the mall to  $50.00\%$ . The  $\$ 529.8$ million acquisition of the  $25.50\%$  effective interest in NEX and the  $\$ 131.3$  million acquisition of the additional  $10.00\%$  interest in Waterway Point are strategic moves to expand FCT’s presence in Singapore’s suburban retail market and to strengthen the quality of its portfolio. With the addition of NEX, FCT now owns or jointly- own four of the ten largest prime suburban malls $^{1}$  in Singapore which are NEX, Northpoint City, Causeway Point and Waterway Point.

# AEI

FCT announced the commencement of the $38.2 million AEI at Tampines 1 in the third quarter of FY2023. The AEI aims to create a refreshed retail experience with the introduction of new retail brands and services, improve asset yield and unlock value through space re-configuration.

The projected return on investment ("ROI") of the AEI is approximately  $8\%$  from higher rent income and savings from sustainable features that reduce energy consumption and carbon emission. The new AEI space attracted strong leasing interest with over  $94\%$  in precommitment. The AEI is progressing on schedule to complete in the fourth quarter of FY2024, ahead of the year-end festive season.

# Divestments

In the final quarter of FY2023, FCT announced the divestment of Changi City Point for  $338.0 million and the divestment of its interests in Hektar REIT for$ 39.3 million. Both divestments were part of the Manager's strategic portfolio review to strengthen FCT's portfolio resilience and are in line with the Manager's long term objective of creating value for FCT Unitholders. The estimated net gain and capital gain from the divestment of Changi City Point are approximately $10.9 million and $20 million, respectively.

# Growing from strength to strength

Since FY2018, FCT has undergone significant portfolio re-constitution that enabled its portfolio to grow 2.3 times in AUM from approximately  $2.8 billion in FY2018 to$ 6.9 billion, through a series of acquisitions of interests in the AsiaRetail Fund portfolio and in Waterway Point; the divestments of three non-core assets (Bedok Point, Anchorpoint and YewTee Point); the acquisition of the interest in NEX and a further interest in Waterway Point. These transactions have further strengthened the resilience of FCT's portfolio while sharpening its focus on the Singapore suburban retail market.

# Strong FY2023 Results

FCT delivered a strong set of results and stable distribution returns for its Unitholders in FY2023. Gross revenue in FY2023 was  $369.7 million and NPI was$ 265.6 million, up 3.6% and 2.7% year-on-year, respectively, and new-highs for FCT. The growth drivers were higher rental income underpinned by higher average portfolio occupancy rate, higher rentals achieved for new and renewed leases during the year, step-up rents from current leases and higher contribution from atrium leasing. The growth in NPI was offset by higher operating expenses due mainly to increased maintenance and utility expenses and a rise in staff costs.

# Stable DPU

Distribution to Unitholders in FY2023 was \(207.7 million, down by \(0.2\%\), due mainly to higher interest expense that increased 73.0% year-on-year to \)81.0 million from \(46.8 million in FY2022. The increase in interest expense was attributed to higher interest rates as well as additional loans drawn down to finance the acquisitions of the interests in NEX and Waterway Point. This translates to a DPU of 12.150 cents for FY2023 which is marginally lower compared to 12.227 cents in FY2022.

# Healthy financial position; poised to strengthen

FCT maintains a healthy financial position. Its aggregate leverage as at 30 September 2023 stood at  $39.3\%$ . This is expected to decline to  $36.1\%$  on a pro forma basis, after the proceeds from the divestments of Changji City Point and the interest in Hektar REIT are used to pare down debts.

# Letter To Unitholders

The aggregate appraised value of FCT's retail portfolio remained relatively stable with gains mainly from NEX and Causeway Point and smaller gains from five other malls which are Tampines 1, Northpoint City North Wing, Waterway Point, Tiong Bahru Plaza and Hougang Mall. The capitalisation rates used by the independent valuers remained unchanged from last year.

# All-round improvement in operational metrics

On the operating front, the portfolio delivered a robust operating performance with higher committed occupancy, better rental reversions and sustained growth in tenants' sales. The committed occupancy of the retail portfolio was up  $2.2\%$  -points year-on-year to  $99.7\%$  as at 30 September 2023. The average portfolio rental reversion came in at  $4.7\%$  (on an average-to-average basis), higher than the  $4.2\%$  in FY2022. Portfolio tenants' sales improved  $7.3\%$  year-on-year and shopper traffic was up  $24.7\%$  year-on-year. The improved tenants' sales helped improve the average occupancy cost to  $15.6\%$  from  $16.2\%$  in FY2022, providing headroom for rental growth.

# Making Progress On The Sustainability Journey and ESG

Sustainability is a key focus in FCT's strategy. The Manager works closely with Frasers Property towards achieving the Group's goal of net-zero carbon by 2050.

For the third consecutive year, FCT achieved a 5-Star rating in the 2023 GRESB Real Estate Assessment. We believe this is a meaningful benchmark that enables our stakeholders to compare FCT's performance with its global real estate peers in the same sector.

FCT has also received an "A" rating from the MSCI ESG Ratings in September 2023, for the second consecutive year.

FCT is leveraging on innovation and technology to improve efficiency in its operations and reduce costs. The initiatives include food waste management, data analytics for lifts and the water valve efficiency initiative. The projected savings of these initiatives when fully implemented is approximately $1 million per annum.

All of FCT's 10 retail malls and one office property have achieved BCA Green Mark certifications with five of them rated Platinum, three rated GoldPlus and three rated Gold on the new stricter Green Mark 2021 framework (GM: 2021). On green financing, the proportion of green loan in FCT's total borrowing stood at  $55.6\%$  as at 30 September 2023, up from  $31.9\%$  last year. The proportion of green loans is expected to increase as we refinance non-green loans with green loans going forward.

Other initiatives include rolling out charging points for electric vehicles in FCT malls to support green mobility and the installation of solar power panels at FCT malls to provide green energy.

FCT is also expanding its efforts in community engagement. During the year, various initiatives such as the Inclusion Champion Program and Paint it Forward for the children were implemented in FCT malls. These initiatives aim to build stronger inclusiveness and a sense of belonging with FCT's stakeholders in the community.

We invite you to read the details in the Sustainability Report which is an integral part of this Annual Report.

# Positive On Outlook Of The Suburban Retail Sector In Singapore

The Manager expects interest rate movements and rising operating expenses to remain the key factors affecting FCT's performance. Barring unforeseen circumstances, the Manager expects the average cost of borrowing for FCT to be above  $4\%$ . For operating expenses, the Manager will continue to work on cost optimisation initiatives, and to remain vigilant on the movement of energy prices and contracted service fees. It will adopt appropriate hedging strategies for energy contracts to mitigate the impact on its operating expenses.

While the macroeconomic environment remains challenging, we remain positive on the outlook of the suburban retail sector in Singapore, based on several factors such as Singapore's population growth, sustained healthy consumer spending on essentials, healthy demand for prime suburban retail space and tight supply in the retail market. We believe FCT is well-positioned to benefit from these factors going forward.

# Acknowledgements

We welcome Mr Ho Kin San and Mr Darren Tan who were appointed to the board as Non-Executive and Independent Directors on 18 July 2023 and 26 September 2023, respectively. Kin San brings on board over 30 years of experience in corporate real estate legal practice across all property sectors. Darren has extensive leadership and management experience in finance and investments. Their appointment to the board will bolster and diversify the breadth of expertise on the board.

We thank Chee Wah, who will be retiring from the FCAM board as Director at the end of 2023. Chee Wah has made immense contributions in providing guidance and advice to the board and management during his tenure. This includes helping FCT navigate through the difficult times of the pandemic in 2020 and providing invaluable views on the transactions which helped re-constituted the enlarged FCT's portfolio. We wish Chee Wah all the best in his future endeavours.

I am retiring from the Board and Ms Koh Choon Fah will replace me as Chairperson on 1 November 2023. It has been an eventful 7 years, an exciting and educational experience for me personally and a challenging but productive period for Management, Board, Company and the Trust, a 7-year period of growth despite extensive business stoppages on account of COVID-19. I am confident Choon Fah and her fellow directors will take FCAM and FCT to greater heights, ably supported as always by an experienced, supremely capable and dedicated Management team.

We thank all our stakeholders, Unitholders, tenants, shoppers and business partners included, for their continuing support.

# Lease Renewals and Rental Reversion

A total of 509 leases in the Retail Portfolio<sup>1</sup> and 10 leases at Central Plaza were renewed or newly leased in FY2023. The retail leases accounted for 780,682 sf or  $31.0\%$  of Retail Portfolio<sup>1</sup> NLA. The NLA of the 10 reversionary leases at Central Plaza in FY2023 represented  $26.6\%$  of its total NLA.

# Positive rental reversion for Retail Portfolio in FY2023

The rental reversion for the Retail Portfolio<sup>1</sup> in FY2023 was positive at  $4.7\%$  based on the variance between the average rent of the incoming lease and the average rent of the outgoing lease ("average-to-average"). The

average rent includes the step-up rents during the respective lease tenure. All malls recorded positive reversion between  $1.8\%$  and  $10.3\%$  due to active asset and property management of the portfolio properties, and the strong leasing demand due to the properties' strategic location in populous residential catchments with direct connectivity to public transport including buses and MRT trains.

Leasing demand for suburban retail malls remained robust in FY2023, particularly by food and beverage and services tenants. The retail market continues to be supported by below historical-average retail pipeline in the near term, and retailers remain cautiously optimistic, prioritising well-managed and well-located malls.

# Lease Expiry Profile

# Well-spread lease expiry profile

The portfolio lease expiry from FY2024 to FY2028 and beyond, and the lease expiry by property in FY2024 are presented in the tables below. The leases have a typical lease duration of 3 years although certain key or anchor tenancies may be of longer tenure.

FCT has a well-spread portfolio lease expiry profile with low concentration risk in any particular financial year. The leases expiring over the next two years in FY2024 and FY2025 account for  $29.3\%$  and  $27.3\%$  of FCT's gross rental income (“GRI”) respectively. As at 30 September 2023, the weighted average lease expiry<sup>3</sup>

("WALE") of the Retail Portfolio $^4$  stood at 1.96 years (FY2022: 1.87 years) by NLA and 1.82 years (FY2022: 1.78 years) by GRI.

The WALE (by GRI) of the retail leases<sup>4</sup> commenced in FY2023, based on duration to lease expiry as at 30 September 2023 was 2.64 years (FY2022: 2.55 years). The WALE (by NLA) of these leases is 2.76 years (FY2022: 2.66 years). These new leases account for  $34.1\%$  (FY2022:  $33.7\%$ ) of the total GRI of the Retail Portfolio<sup>4</sup> as at 30 September 2023.

The aggregate NLA of the leases in the Retail Portfolio due for renewal in FY2024 is 708,137 sf.

# Portfolio Tenants' Sales, Shopper Traffic and Occupancy Cost

Tenants' sales improved  $7.3\%$  year- on- year The total tenants' sales of the Retail Portfolio $^\circ$  in FY2023 stood at  $\$ 2,215.6$  million, which is  $7.3\%$  higher than  $\$ 2,065.6$  million achieved in FY2022 and averaged approximately  $17\%$  above pre- COVID- 19 levels. Brick- and- mortar retail stores and restaurants once again showed resilience and the significant sales growth over 2023 is a testament to ongoing consumer demand for in- store experiences.

Sales growth varies across the trade categories The top five trade categories which constituted  $78.5\%$  of the Retail Portfolio  $^4$  GRI traded well. Food & Beverage, the largest trade category representing  $37.5\%$  (by GRI) of the Retail Portfolio, registered stronger sales year-on-year in FY2023, particularly for Restaurants, Cafes and Food Courts with new tenants showing stronger performance.

Beauty & Healthcare, the second largest trade category representing  $14.5\%$  (by GRI), also displayed higher year-on-year sales in FY2023, largely driven by higher demand for beauty salons and cosmetics as people returned to work.

Occupancy cost refers to the ratio of gross rental (including turnover rent) paid by the tenants to the tenant's sales turnover (excluding GST). The average occupancy cost of the Retail Portfolio for FY2023 and the preceding five financial years are presented in the chart on the right.

As tenants' sales saw a continued improvement in FY2023 with the significant scale back of COVID-19 restrictions, the average occupancy cost of the Retail Portfolio<sup>6</sup> moderated to  $15.6\%$  in FY2023 which is within a healthy and sustainable range for suburban retail malls.

# Operations Review

# Leases With Gross Turnover Rent and Step-Up Clauses

Approximately  $96.4\%$  (FY2022:  $91.8\%$ ) of the Retail Portfolio leases include step-up rent clauses that provide for annual rental increment of between  $1\%$  and  $2\%$  over the lease term.  $93.3\%$  (FY2022:  $92.3\%$ ) of the committed leases include GTO rent clauses, which the tenants would typically pay between  $0.5\%$  and  $1.0\%$  of their sales as part of the gross rent.

# Portfolio Occupancy

The Retail Portfolio committed occupancy stood at  $99.7\%$  as at 30 September 2023, up  $2.2\%$  -points year-on-year. The majority of the malls show a year-on-year improvement in occupancy. The improvement in portfolio occupancy is in tandem with leasing activity picking up as Singapore reopens and embarks on its journey towards endemic living.

# Shopper Traffic

Shopper traffic of the Retail Portfolio<sup>7</sup> continues its recovery trajectory as Singapore reverts its Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level from yellow to green in February 2023 after more than three years of living with heightened health alerts due to COVID-19. COVID-19 measures were further scaled back, with masks no longer required on public transport as well as the stepping down of the use of TraceTogether and SafeEntry. This marks a significant progress towards normalization as the aggregate shopper traffic of the Retail Portfolio<sup>7</sup> improved by  $24.7\%$  from 137.1 million in FY2022 to 171.0 million in FY2023. All malls recorded recovery in shopper footfall in FY2023.

# Performance Comparison Between FY2023 and FY2022

Gross revenue for FY2023 was  $369.7 million, an increase of$ 12.8 million or 3.6% from FY2022. The increase was mainly due to higher gross rent arising from higher occupancy rates, higher rental achieved for new and renewed leases and staggered rent across most malls and increase in atrium income with the resumption of atrium events with effect from 29 March 2022. It was partially offset by the lower gross revenue at Tampines 1 due to asset enhancement initiatives.

Property expenses for FY2023 was  $104.1 million, an increase of$ 5.8 million or 5.9% from FY2022. The increase was mainly due to higher maintenance and utility expenses, and higher staff costs during the year. It was partially offset by property tax refunds received during the financial year.

Net property income for FY2023 was therefore higher at  $265.6 million, an increase of$ 7.0 million or 2.7% from FY2022.

Net non-property expenses for FY2023 of  $116.5 million was$ 33.5 million or 40.3% higher than FY2022 mainly due to higher interest expense of $34.2 million attributed to the higher interest rate and additional loan drawdown to finance the acquisition of an additional 10.00% interest in SST and effective 25.50% interest in GRPL, as well as increase in asset management fees arising from higher net property income and higher total assets with the acquisition of an additional 10.00% interest in SST and effective 25.50% interest in GRPL. This was partially offset by the one-off grant income recognised in FY2023.

Total return included:

- Share of results of associate of  $5.9 million was$ 7.0 million higher than FY2022 due to the share of H-REIT's fair value gain on investment properties of $3.6 million (FY2022: share of fair value loss on investment properties of $4.1 million).  
Impairment loss on investment in associate of \(4.0 million recognised in FY2023.  
Share of results of joint ventures of  $51.2 million was$ 26.6 million higher than FY2022 due to recognition of an additional 10.00% share of SST's results with effect from 8 February 2023 and 51.00% share of NP Trust's results with effect from 6 February 2023. Included in the share of results of joint ventures, was a one-off gain of $13.6 million recognised upon the completion of the acquisition of an additional 10.00% interest in SST and effective 25.50% interest in GRPL as well as share of revaluation gain from SST and NP Trust of $4.9 million.  
In FY2023, the Group recognised a net change in fair value of investment properties of $9.9 million.  
No provision has been made for tax at the Trust level as well as for certain subsidiaries as it is assumed that  $100\%$  of the taxable income available for distribution to Unitholders in the next financial year will be distributed. The Tax Ruling grants tax transparency to FCT, Tiong Bahru Plaza Trust 1, White Sands Trust 1, Hougang Mall Trust 1, Tampines 1 Trust 1, Century Square Trust 1, Century Square Trust 2 and Central Plaza Trust 1 on their taxable income that is distributed to Unitholders such that the aforementioned entities would not be taxed on such taxable income. The Group's tax expense of  $\$0.3$  million mainly arose from under-provision of prior year tax expenses of certain subsidiaries within the Group.

# Total Assets, Net Asset Value Per Unit and Net Tangible Asset Per Unit

As at 30 September 2023, the total assets stood at  $6,375.2 million, an increase of$ 433.8 million from $5,941.4 million a year ago. The increase was mainly attributed to the acquisition of an additional 10.00% interest in SST and effective 25.50% interest in GRPL.

FCT's net assets stood at \(3,973.2 million as at 30 September 2023, an increase of \)9.1 million compared with \(3,964.1 million a year ago.

The Net Asset Value ("NAV") and the Net Tangible Asset ("NTA") of FCT Group decreased slightly to  $2.32 per Unit from$ 2.33 per Unit a year ago, primarily due to a larger base of total issued and issuable units. The NAV and NTA per Unit are calculated based on the following:

<table><tr><td></td><td>30 September 2023</td><td>30 September 2022</td></tr><tr><td>NAV/NTA ($&#x27;000)</td><td>3,973,235</td><td>3,964,077</td></tr><tr><td>Total issued and issuable Units (&#x27;000)</td><td>1,712,039</td><td>1,703,765</td></tr><tr><td>NAV/NTA per Unit ($)</td><td>2.32</td><td>2.33</td></tr></table>

# Appraised Value of Properties

Independent valuations of the investment properties, including investment property reclassified to assets held for sale were undertaken by Jones Lang LaSalle Property Consultants Pte Ltd and Savills Valuation and Professional Services (S) Pte Ltd.

The Manager believes that these independent valuers possess appropriate professional qualifications and relevant experience in the location and category of the investment properties being valued. Valuation methods used for the investment properties include the capitalisation approach and discounted cash flow analysis (and direct comparison method as a cross-check) in determining the fair values of the properties.

Annual valuations are required by the Code on Collective Investment Schemes.

The total appraised value of FCT Group's investment property portfolio<sup>1</sup> as at 30 September 2023 stood at $5,545.5 million, stable as compared with $5,516.0 million a year ago.

The appraised values of Causeway Point, Northpoint City North Wing, Tampines 1, Tiong Bahru Plaza, Hougang Mall and Central Plaza saw an increase of between  $1.5 million and$ 13.0 million. Valuation of Century Square, White Sands, Changi City Point and Yishun 10 Retail Podium remained the same compared to a year ago.

# 2. Economic Context

This section provides background information on the economic context at the global and Singapore levels.

# Current Situation & Near-Term Outlook

The global economy has maintained its growth trajectory through 2023 despite various geopolitical events and shocks to the financial system. However, growth has been uneven across various countries and regions.

On one hand, the United States (US) achieved year-on-year real gross domestic product (GDP) growth of around  $2.4\%$  in Q2 2023, notwithstanding continued monetary tightening. At the same time, the US unemployment rate has ranged between  $3.4\%$  and  $3.8\%$  throughout 2023 so far, on par with pre-pandemic lows in 2019. China also posted healthy year-on-year GDP growth of  $5.2\%$  for the first three quarters of 2023, aided by low base effects from 2022 when "Zero COVID" restrictions were still in place. Conversely, the European Union posted much lower GDP growth of around  $0.4\%$  year-on-year as at Q2 2023, as member countries continued to experience the impacts of economic and supply chain disruptions caused by the Russia-Ukraine War.

For the full year of 2023, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts global GDP growth to reach  $3.0\%$ . The anticipated growth is lower than the  $3.5\%$  growth achieved in 2022 as the post-pandemic consumption rebound diminishes. Positively, global inflation is also forecast to decline this year in response to interest rate hikes, falling from  $8.7\%$  in 2022 to  $6.9\%$  in 2023.

Several risks cloud the global economic outlook. Firstly, protracted geopolitical instability continues to present a risk for commodity price inflation. In addition to the Russia-Ukraine war, which has now lasted for over a year, war has also broken out between Israel and Hamas. There are concerns that an escalation of this war might lead to higher oil prices should major oil producers in the region also become involved.

Second, China's real estate market situation could have broader ramifications on the world's second largest economy. Major Chinese property developers such as Evergrande and Country Garden remain in financial distress, facing challenges repaying various debt obligations. Should any of the major Chinese real estate developers face liquidation and cease operations, there could be negative knock-on effects on broader household wealth, employment and spending power amongst Chinese consumers.

In Singapore, real GDP in Q3 2023 grew by  $0.7\%$  year-on-year according to the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI)'s advance estimates. The main drivers of this growth were hospitality services, supported by a recovery in tourism, and construction. In contrast, manufacturing showed a year-on-year decline in GDP, and has been the main reason Singapore has experienced such moderate growth. One bright spot within the manufacturing sector is the transport engineering sector, which has benefited from the recovery in air travel.

For the full year of 2023, MTI is forecasting real GDP growth within a range of  $0.5\% - 1.5\%$ . This is a moderate level of growth compared to the 2022 growth of  $3.6\%$ , reflecting Singapore's exposure to the global economy and the challenges it is currently facing.

# Medium-Term Outlook

The IMF forecasts global GDP growth to slow in 2024 to  $2.9\%$ , accompanied by a further decline in inflation to  $5.8\%$  as monetary tightening policies continue to take effect. For Singapore, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) expects growth to be modest in the first half of 2024 before picking up in the latter half. Nevertheless, there are several factors that could affect the medium-term economic outlook.

The first factor concerns future monetary policy decisions. In 2023, the US Federal Reserve ("Fed") led the continued tightening of monetary policy globally, with four rate hikes of 25 basis points each until September 2023. The Fed, along with other central banks, has since paused further rate hikes to assess the macroeconomic situation before making further policy changes. In Singapore, MAS has neither tightened nor loosened its exchange rate policy throughout 2023 so far.

Central banks will need to carefully calibrate future monetary policy, namely the direction and magnitude of future interest rate changes, to achieve a balanced moderation of both inflation and growth. Over tightening could lead to a sharp contraction in global consumption, which would negatively impact Singapore's export output. Conversely, not sufficiently tightening monetary policy risks worsening the high cost of living situation, which would also dampen spending.

The second factor concerns the economic and demographic situation in China. Besides the challenges with its real estate market, China is facing an ageing and shrinking population, having recorded its first population decline in six decades in 2022. Youth unemployment has also risen, leading some young consumers to tighten their belts amid lower incomes and higher costs of living. If unaddressed, these factors could dampen the consumption power of one of Singapore's largest trading partners.

# Long-Term Outlook

The risk factors outlined above are all global in nature, and as a small and open economy, Singapore is not immune to them. Notwithstanding, Singapore's good governance, business-friendly policies and political stability relative to many other countries provide strong fundamentals for the city-state to navigate future economic uncertainties adeptly. Furthermore, Singapore stands to benefit from its geographical proximity and connections to emerging Asian economies that are projected to be some of the fastest-growing markets in the coming years.

Going forward, full-year GDP growth is forecast to average around  $2.3\%$  p.a. between 2023 and 2030.

# Retail Property Market Overview

# 3. Inflation

Inflation in Singapore has slowed compared to 2022 and was estimated at around  $5.1\%$  year-on-year as at September 2023. Nevertheless, prices of goods and services continue to be on the rise. Product and service categories that registered the highest inflation rates in September 2023 include food and beverage services and transport driven by higher car prices.

To help Singaporeans cope with the higher cost of living, the Singapore government announced enhancements to the Assurance Package and the Permanent GST Voucher Scheme at Budget 2023. In October 2023, the government also introduced a SGD 1.1 billion Cost of Living Support Package for households. These support measures provide cash payouts, rebates and vouchers to help cushion the impact of price increases and GST hikes. On the monetary policy front, MAS has not conducted any further policy tightening this year following five consecutive rounds of tightening between October 2021 and October 2022.

For the full year of 2023, MAS forecasts overall inflation to average around  $5\%$ , down from  $6.1\%$  in 2022. Thereafter, inflation is projected to moderate further to  $3.0\% - 4.0\%$  in 2024, including the impact of a further GST increase to  $9\%$ .

# 4. Population Growth

# Total Population Growth & Demographic Trends

Singapore's population rebounded by  $5.0\%$  from 2022 to 2023 to reach 5.92 million, extending the  $3.4\%$  growth in 2022 and exceeding the pre-pandemic population level. This growth was largely driven by foreigners, particularly foreign Work Permit holders who accounted for more than half of population growth in the year. Demand for foreign workers has increased this year due to service construction projects that have resumed after the pandemic.

The population of residents (including Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents) and white-collar expatriates has grown at a slower rate. Slower natural population growth among residents has contributed to this; Singapore's resident fertility rates have dropped to an all-time low of around 1.04 and resident births have fallen over the years. The government has rolled out various policies over the years to address this, and most recently announced the following policies to be implemented from 1 January 2024:

- Giving greater priority to first-time families in applications for four-room or smaller Standard Build-To-Order flats across Singapore.  
- Increasing the Baby Bonus Cash Gift and the Child Development Account First Step Grant for all eligible Singaporean children. There will also be a higher co-matching cap in the Child Development Account for the first and second child.  
- Extending government-paid paternity leave from two weeks to four weeks.

In the long term, we expect Singapore's natural population growth among residents to remain low, leaving inward migration as the main driver of future population growth. The government recognises this and has maintained policies to keep Singapore open to global talent. One such policy is the Overseas Network and Expertise (One) Pass, a new work pass that was introduced in 2022 to attract top foreign talent with valuable networks and deep skills from across all industries.

Overall, we forecast population growth to average around  $1.1\%$  p.a. in 2024 - 2031 to bring total population to around 6.4 million by 2031.

# Geographical Distribution of Population Growth

Future housing development influences the future geographical distribution of the population. Future population growth is generally expected to be stronger in the areas outside Central Core, with more housing units planned in these areas.

The Outer West sector stands out with a residential housing pipeline of 29,000 units, or close to a quarter of total upcoming housing supply island-wide, either planned or under construction. The main contributor of future supply in the Outer West sector is Tengah, the Housing & Development Board's (HDB) newest public housing estate with more than 22,000 units launched as at October 2023.

The central fringe areas also have sizeable amounts of new housing planned or under construction. The Central West and Central East sectors both have around 18,000 new housing units in the pipeline, comprising a mix of large Built-to-Order public housing and private housing projects.

Public & Private Housing Units Pipeline (Planned & Under Construction) by Sector From Q2 2023

# Household Income Growth

Between 2012 and 2022, average household income per resident grew by around  $3.5\%$  p.a. on average. While incomes were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, they have since rebounded exceeded prepandemic levels. Between 2021 and 2022, average household income per resident grew by around  $7.5\%$  year-on-year.

Other than income from work, income from other sources (e.g. investments) and savings also influence the amount of disposable income that consumers have available to spend. Taking all of these elements into account, total personal disposable income in Singapore grew by around  $5.1\%$  p.a. on average between 2012 and 2022.

Looking forward to the next few years, disposable income growth may slow as households opt to save more in response to economic uncertainties and the impending GST increase. The longer-term outlook for income growth will depend on the fundamental strength of the Singapore economy and its ability to continue attracting investments and companies that generate well-paying employment opportunities.

# 5. Tourism Growth

While Singapore's tourism sector has yet to fully bounce back from the pandemic, it has made steady progress towards recovery. Visitor arrivals between January and September 2023 have reached around 10.1 million, which is around  $70\%$  higher than the same period in 2022 but still around  $40\%$  below the same period in 2019.

With China reopening in January 2023, China is now Singapore's second biggest tourist source market, contributing around 1 million visitor arrivals between January and September 2023. However, this is only around one-third of the total arrivals during the same period in 2019. Positively, other major source markets like Indonesia and India have shown stronger recoveries for the same period, with arrivals from these countries having reached over  $70\%$  of 2019 total visitor arrivals.

The steady recovery has been facilitated by the decisive steps that Singapore has taken to revive its tourism sector. These include removing all border restrictions, reopening Changi Airport Terminal 2 and resuming various business and leisure events. Besides these measures, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) has rolled out multiple initiatives to raise Singapore's profile as a global tourist destination under its "Made in Singapore" brand campaign, which aims to spotlight uniquely Singapore experiences. STB has partnered the Infocomm Media Development Authority to launch a $10-million Singapore On-Screen fund to "inspire travel to Singapore through TV series and films". This joint fund will support international media and entertainment partners to produce global TV and film projects that feature Singapore as a destination for international audiences.

STB also continues to partner the private sector to promote Singapore as a tourist destination. For instance, it is partnering Google's ARCore for AI-powered guided tours within its Visit Singapore application. Another example is its partnership with Disney Cruise Line to homeport a brand-new Disney cruise ship exclusively in Singapore for at least five years from 2025.

In the near future, visitor inflows from China will influence how quickly Singapore's tourism sector can make a full recovery. In turn, the appetite for outbound tourism from China will depend on the level of consumer confidence given China's ongoing property market, youth unemployment and other broader economic issues. Notwithstanding, other factors could support tourism growth in the coming year. Of particular note are upcoming major events such as Coldplay and Taylor Swift's sold-out concerts, which are expected to bring in numerous visitors from the region. At the same time, Singapore's tourism and economic agencies' ongoing destination marketing initiatives remain important to continue attracting visitors from all source markets.

# 6. Retail Sales

# Current Situation

Following a steep decline in 2020, retail sales began to recover in 2021 and have continued to grow over the past two years. Growth has been facilitated by consumers' pent-up demand for shopping from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Different product categories have seen sales rebound to differing extents. Some categories have seen sales return to or even exceed pre-pandemic levels, while others have yet to fully recover.

Comparing total sales in the first eight months of the year, computer and telecommunications equipment sales have grown the most between 2019 and 2023. For the same period, sales in food retail and non-food discretionary categories such as jewellery, apparel, and household goods have also exceeded pre-pandemic levels in 2023. While groceries and household equipment sales remain well above pre-pandemic levels in 2023, they have fallen from the exceptional highs in 2022 amid the return to a post-pandemic normal. Nonetheless, sales of grocery essentials at supermarkets and hypermarkets have evidently been resilient since they remain well above pre-pandemic levels according to SingStat's data.

In contrast, department stores continue to perform relatively poorly amid changing shopper preferences.

Department store sales for the first eight months of 2023 are around  $16\%$  below those in the first eight months of 2019. F&B sales at restaurants are also still slightly below pre-pandemic levels for the same period despite all dine-in restrictions having been lifted.

Given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on retail in Singapore and the fact that the virus is now endemic, the chart below compares the growth in nominal retail sales by category between the first eight months of 2023 and the same period in 2019.

# Nominal Retail Sales Growth by Category

Source: SingStat, Cistri

In addition to growth in the volume of goods and service sold, price growth – or retail price inflation – also forms a component of nominal sales growth. The chart below provides a short-term comparison on the retail price changes of various retail categories between the previous and current year. Comparing the growth in nominal and real retail sales for the first eight months of 2022 and 2023 suggests that most retail product categories saw price increases between the two years. Food and beverage services categories, including restaurants, fast food outlets and other catering businesses, registered the highest rates of retail price inflation.

Note: Calculated as the difference between the change in nominal retail sales and the change in real retail sales in each category Source: SingStat, Cistri

Based on SingStat's data up to August 2023, Cistri forecasts full-year nominal retail sales (excluding petrol and motor vehicles but including F&B) to grow by around  $6.8\%$  in 2023. Spending growth towards the end of the year may be supported by consumers frontloading some purchases ahead of the 2024 GST hike, especially for high-value items such as household goods and electronics.

# Medium-Term and Long-Term Outlook

With a softer economic outlook in 2024 and the uncertainties around tourism from China, retail sales growth is forecast to slow. A sustained recovery in retail sales thereafter will depend on whether a stable economic environment with moderate inflation can be achieved, and how inbound tourism from China and other major markets can fully recover.

Overall, between 2023 and 2031, total nominal retail sales growth is forecast to average around  $4.8\%$  p.a..

Not all of this growth will accrue to bricks-and-mortar retail stores. However, data from SingStat suggests that the absolute levels of online retail and F&B sales have stabilised since 2022, and their share of total sales has begun to decline. This data suggests that the share of sales captured by physical retailers is recovering.

# Retail Property Market Overview

Our view is that physical stores will continue to play a critical role in facilitating most retail transactions over the next decade, particularly via omnichannel means. Furthermore, there will be variations in the pace of bricks-and-mortar sales recovery across different types of retail centres. High-quality, well-managed and well-located retail centres are likely to experience a faster uptick in sales.

# 7. Retail Supply

Cistri's estimate of future retail floorspace includes announced retail projects, longer-term allowances for unannounced future projects, as well as an allowance for obsolescence. Supply forecasts for announced projects are based on the URA's commercial projects pipelines and developers' intentions.

Total retail net letable area (NLA) supply in Singapore reached 66.8 million sq ft by end 2022, approximately 300,000 sq ft higher than in 2021. By end 2023, total retail NLA is expected to reach around 67.6 million sq ft due to a combination of recent (e.g. Woodleigh Mall and Sengkang Grand Mall) and anticipated mall openings (e.g. One Holland Village), centre re-openings post-renovation (e.g. Changi Airport Terminal 2), and the opening of retail podiums (e.g. Guoco Midtown and Komo Shoppes). However, there has also been some mall closures. CapitaLand's JCube was closed in August 2023 to make way for a mixed-use condominium, J'den, comprising of 38 storeys of residential units and two storeys of retail space.

By 2027, total retail floorspace is forecast to increase to around 68.9 million sq ft, which translates to an average growth rate of approximately  $0.6\%$  p.a. from 2022. This includes both mall and non-mall floorspace, including retail spaces operated by HDB and hotels. Of the total floorspace supply by 2027, around  $55\%$  is expected to be in shopping centre format, and around  $37\%$  of the shopping centre floorspace is anticipated to be outside the Central Area. As a proportion of total retail floorspace, the share of shopping centre floorspace outside the Central Area is expected to remain stable at around  $20\%$  from 2022 to 2027.

Notable upcoming retail centre projects include a mixture of projects in the central fringe, suburban east and northeast Singapore. These are listed in table below.

Besides the above, several other locations provide the potential for new retail floorspace:

- Areas identified for development under URA's 2019 Master Plan, including: Woodlands Regional Centre, Changi Gateway, the Greater Southern Waterfront, Tengah and Bidadari, as well as tourist destinations like Sentosa-Brani, Jurong Lake District and Mandai Eco-Tourism Hub.  
- Government Land Sales (GLS) provide opportunities for mixed-use developments with retail components. Currently, there are three GLS sites that could potentially accommodate retail development, two of which are in the Confirmed List and the remaining one on the Reserve List. As of October 2023, there has yet to be a successful developer application for Woodlands Avenue 2 white site as it remains on the Reserve List.  
- A key unknown for supply in the western suburbs of Singapore is the future of Jurong Lake District (JLD). Some retail will almost certainly be part of the JLD project. A maximum of approximately 570,000 sq.ft has been allocated for a range of uses of which retail is just one. Other uses include hotels, sports facilities and community uses. As such, it remains unclear what size of retail will be provided. While this remains a risk for malls located in the west of Singapore, we do not expect it to occur prior to 2028.

# 8. Shopping Centre Floorspace Per Capita

By end 2023, Singapore's shopping centre floorspace per capita provision is anticipated to reach around 6.2 sq ft NLA. This is similar to the provision in 2022 primarily due to the shopping centre floorspace increasing in tandem to Singapore's population growth. By 2027, we expect floorspace per capita to moderate slightly to around 6.1 sq ft as population continues to grow faster than supply.

Compared to other countries, Singapore has a lower provision of floorspace per capita compared to other larger countries like the US, Australia, and other major cities in the region. This is primarily because Singapore has fewer large shopping centres.

However, the quantum of floorspace per capita does not reflect the quality of the retail offering. Singapore generally has good quality shopping malls, a comprehensive retail hierarchy, and low levels of vacancy. This means that shoppers are generally well-served notwithstanding the lower per capita provision of floorspace.

Global benchmarks updated based on latest data availability. Source: Cistri

Amongst the various regions of Singapore, the highest concentration of shopping centre floorspace is within the central areas, particularly around Orchard Road. The suburban areas have lower provisions, ranging from around 2.1 sq ft per capita in the Outer North to around 4.3 sq ft per capita in the Outer East in 2022.

Cistri expects the Outer Northeast region to be the only region to experience growth in per capita floorspace provision between 2022 and 2027. Contributing to this are new and upcoming openings such as Sengkang Grand Mall and the retail components of Punggol Digital District. In all other regions, floorspace per capita is expected to decline from 2022 as Singapore's total population is expected to rise faster than the shopping centre floorspace stock.

# 9. The Available Market For Suburban Malls

Malls outside the Central Area account for around  $20\%$  of the total retail floorspace in Singapore. While this is not the majority, malls outside the Central Area serve as important retail amenities for a sizeable portion of Singapore's population.

As illustrated in the heatmap below, many malls outside the Central Area are located in high density residential areas. These areas include Sengkang and Punggol in the northeast, Tampines in the east, Yishun in the north and Jurong in the west. Furthermore, Cistri estimates that around 3 million people, or over half of Singapore's population, live within  $1\mathrm{km}$  of a mall located outside the Central Area. This suggests that malls outside the Central Area are well-positioned to serve a large proportion of Singapore's resident population, especially for daily convenience shopping that is typically done close to residents' homes.

Malls outside the Central Area are also well-positioned to capture spending from new residents in suburban growth areas. Cistri estimates that over a third of the new housing units being built or planned across Singapore is located within 1 km of a mall located outside the Central Area.

# 10. Market Share Of Shopping Centre NLA By Owner

FCT remains the second-largest owner of total shopping centre floorspace in Singapore with a market share of around  $6.1\%$  as at 30 October 2023. This is slightly higher than the previous year due to the closure of JCube and acquisition of NEX from NTUC Enterprise.

Note: As at October 2023

Similarly, FCT's share of suburban shopping centre floorspace as at 30 October 2023 is estimated to be higher than last year too, at around  $10.6\%$ .

Source:Cistri  
Note: As at October 2023

The sale of shopping centres by Mercatus, NTUC Enterprise's real estate subsidiary, was the key transaction leading to notable changes to the top 10 shopping centre owners in 2023:

- Due to the divestment of Jurong Point, Thomson Plaza and NEX, NTUC Enterprise's market share has declined significantly and it has dropped out of the list of top 10 shopping centre owners.  
- Link REIT is now part of the top 10 shopping centre floorspace owners since its purchase of Jurong Point and NTUC Enterprise's share of Thomson Plaza.  
- Frasers Property has entered the list of top 10 owners due to its acquisition of NTUC Enterprise's share of NEX in early 2023.

Cistri estimates that around 3 million people or approximately half of Singapore's population live within a 3 km radius from FCT's suburban malls. Many of these people live in the north, east and northeast areas. Among the top suburban mall owners FCT has the second highest number of people living within 3 km of its suburban malls.

# 11. Retail Rents & Occupancy

After several very challenging years, the recovery in retail sales and tourism appears to have started to the benefit of retail landlords in the central area. Average retail occupancy in Orchard Road and the Rest of City Area both increased by 1.5 to 2.0 percentage points between Q4 2021 and Q4 2022. This brought average occupancy in both areas to around  $90\%$ .

Nevertheless, the Suburban submarket continues to outperform with an average occupancy of around  $94.5\%$  as at Q4 2022. Furthermore, the recovery in central area occupancies still appears to be volatile, with average occupancy on Orchard Road decreasing again in the first three quarters of 2023 to around  $88\%$ .

We note that several new stores have opened in Orchard Road in Q3 2023. Considering this, as well as the continued recovery of tourism, we anticipate occupancies on Orchard Road and in the central areas more generally to further improve by the end of 2023. Suburban occupancies, which are already outperforming those in central areas, are expected to remain stable at an average of around  $94\%$ .

Source: URA, Cistri

Continuing the trend since the COVID-19 pandemic, retail rents as measured by the URA declined further over 2022. Central submarkets saw a sharper decline in rents between 2021 and 2022, although quarter-on-quarter data for the first half of 2023 suggests central submarket rents may be starting to stabilise. Conversely, the Suburban submarket posted a smaller rental decline between 2021 and 2022, but have declined faster quarter-on-quarter through to the third quarter of 2023.

We note that there are a range of different sources for rents in the market. Some of the real estate agencies have indicated that they are seeing stronger quarter-on-quarter growth in rents than reported by the URA. These agencies are utilising their own baskets of leases which can result in different outcomes. That said, we believe that the agencies data reflects real growth in the market, and we would expect to see further growth in the market come through the URA data in coming quarters.

With growing sales and declining rentals, rental affordability has improved in recent quarters. However, there remain some challenges for retailers including a continued manpower crunch, other rising costs and the GST increase.

We expect the current trend of rental decline to bottom out by the end of 2023 before beginning to rebound in 2024. A stronger recovery is anticipated for the central submarkets as tourism traffic picks up. In the medium- to long-term, as retail sales continue to recover, we anticipate both rents and occupancies to further improve.

# 12. Retail Trends In The Post-COVID-19 World

Singapore's retail market continues to be shaped by trends that were accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as structural changes to the demographics, attitudes and behaviours of its resident consumer base.

# Post-COVID-19 Consumer Movement Patterns Continue to Support Localisation

Over the last few years, Singapore has relaxed COVID-19 restrictions and fully removed all movement and border restrictions as of early 2023. While people have been allowed to move freely across the island for some time, people movement patterns do not appear to have fully returned to pre-pandemic conditions. Notably, the pandemic has increased the adoption of work-from-home practices and led to consumers spending more time in the suburban areas where they live compared to the pre-pandemic period.

These changes appear to have benefited suburban malls, enabling them to attract a higher share of footfall. According to human mobility data from international data provider Near, suburban malls attracted around  $74\%$  of total resident visits to malls across Singapore in 2022. This share has remained stable since 2020 and is around five percentage points higher than pre-pandemic levels.

# Retail Property Market Overview

As consumers turn more to their local malls, mall owners have an opportunity to reposition their properties as community hubs serving local needs. This could involve combining convenience retail with community gathering spaces, civic uses and public activities that attract surrounding residents. For example, two newly opened malls in 2023 – The Woodleigh Mall and Sengkang Grand Mall – are integrated with Community Clubs that offer community classes and events, which can act as drivers of regular footfall to the malls.

# Catering to the Silver Consumer

Like many other developed countries, Singapore has a growing silver population. Over the last decade, the proportion of Singapore residents aged 65 and above has increased from around  $10.5\%$  in 2013 to around  $17.3\%$  in 2023. This brings the resident population aged 65 and above to around 717,800 in 2023. As the silver generation becomes an increasingly significant consumer market, shopping malls will need to tailor their offer to be relevant to senior shoppers.

Each generation of shoppers has a different lifestyle and thus different spending habits. In Singapore, the Household Expenditure Survey shows several differences in the spending patterns between elderly households and the average household.

First, elderly households allocate a higher proportion of spending to food retail and groceries and a lower proportion of spending to dining out (i.e. F&B) compared to the average Singapore household. This reflects elderly consumers' preference to cook and eat at home. Similar trends have also been observed in spending statistics for other countries.

Elderly households also naturally allocate a higher proportion of spending to health services, reflecting the physical needs at this life stage.

Third, elderly households allocate a higher proportion of spending to home furnishings and equipment, and a lower proportion to transport compared to the average Singapore household. While the lower spending on transport may reflect travel subsidies for senior citizens, it may also be a result of elderly consumers' preference to spend more time at home.

Overall, these findings reflect senior shoppers' relatively homebound lifestyles, which are in turn associated with more purchases relating to their homes and cooking and eating at home.

These findings have implications for the trade mix of malls serving senior shoppers. Notably, shopping centre operators could look to enhance their fresh food and groceries and health services offer to better cater to senior shoppers' preferences. In some cases, in Singapore (e.g. Pasir Ris Mall), the government is requiring that new malls provide more health and well-being services into their tenant mix. While this may be mandated in some projects, we have observed other projects in other markets where this has occurred without a government mandate due to higher visitation that may be induced.

Beyond the trade mix, mall owners are also putting more thought into the design and ambience of spaces to make them more inclusive towards senior shoppers. For instance, Frasers Property has set aside calm zones during designated mall opening hours, when in-store lighting will be dimmed and music volume restricted to create a more comfortable shopping environment for the elderly. Besides ambience, walkability and wayfinding are also important areas of enhancement that mall owners can consider.

# Catering to Next-Generation Consumers Through Omnicannel Retail

Meanwhile, the young generation of shoppers continue to appreciate the convenience offered by omnichannel experiences. In response to this, more omnichannel retailers continue to emerge, and many of those looking to tap into the market of young shoppers in Southeast Asia are doing so via Singapore. Examples of recent entrants into Singapore's retail market include Luckin Coffee, as well as digital native brands such as Spanish furniture retailer Kave Home and Chinese apparel brand Neiwai. The entry of digital native brands into physical retailing presents an opportunity for malls to discover new potential tenants that can enhance the omnichannel experience at shopping malls.

Having a successful omnichannel offer also includes offering shoppers an enjoyable in-store shopping experience beyond making purchases. Retailers are therefore increasingly incorporating experiential elements into their physical stores. Some retailers, such as fashion retailers Marimekko, FJ Benjamin and cycling apparel brand Pas Normal Studios, have chosen to do this by offering in-store dining experiences. These higher-end brands are following the trends set by mass market brands such as Muji and Benjamin Barker. Others are offering interactive educational experiences, such as Richard Mille's in-store watchmaking workshops.

# Rising Shopper Awareness on Sustainability

Singapore shoppers are gradually becoming more conscious about sustainability. This has encouraged the emergence of stores focused on the sale and swapping of second-hand goods, notably apparel aimed at youths. An example is second-hand fashion retailer Refash, which so far has added five new store locations across central and suburban malls in 2023. Recognising the growth potential of second-hand fashion retail, online marketplace Carousell has acquired Refash.

The growing public interest in environmental topics also presents mall operators an opportunity to organise sustainability-themed placemaking activations. Lendlease has done this through its "You Won't Believe It'strash" exhibition at PLQ Mall this year. The event includes a textiles collection drive, where selected participants can receive prizes in exchange for their textile recycling donations. Such activations can attract visitors to malls while providing them opportunities to contribute to sustainability initiatives.

# Retail Within Mixed-Use Developments

New malls in Singapore are increasingly being developed as part of mixed-use developments with residences, offices and/or hotels accompanying the retail offer. This is the case for almost all of the known upcoming malls in Singapore. In addition, CapitaLand and Frasers Property have proposed to redevelop JCube and Bedok Point respectively into residential-led mixed-use developments.

Mixed-use development can create benefits for both the retail and non-retail components. On one hand, the retail mall benefits from direct access to an on-site market of potential shoppers, which support footfall and sales at the mall. On the other hand, the mall provides an amenity that enhances the attractiveness of the on-site residences, offices or hotels. In turn, this can support the take-up or occupancy, as well as the sales price or rental premiums, that these non-retail components can achieve.

To achieve these benefits, both the retail and non-retail uses have to be designed optimally and developed to a high quality. Developers with diverse capabilities and experience developing high-quality properties across a range of asset classes are best positioned to do this and take advantage of the mixed-use development trend.

# 13. Conclusion

The situation in Singapore's retail market has continued to improve since the challenges of COVID-19. The market has exceeded pre-pandemic levels and continued to enjoy another strong year of growth over 2023. SingStat's retail sales data for the first eight months of 2023 continues to paint a positive picture, with sales across numerous product categories exceeding the same period in 2019.

While the COVID-19 pandemic is over, certain shopper behaviours appear to have persisted. Of particular note is how suburban malls appear to still be capturing a higher share of resident mall visits compared to pre-pandemic levels despite the complete removal of movement restrictions. This, combined with the occupancy performance of suburban retail, shows the resilience of the suburban retail performance throughout both pandemic and nonpandemic conditions.

While the resident spending market fundamentals appear robust, we note that the tourist market has yet to fully recover. The economic situation in China, one of Singapore's main tourist source markets pre-pandemic, will be a key determinant of how quickly this recovery can occur. Besides this, the global outlook for inflation will continue to impact cost of living and thus consumers' ability and willingness to spend on retail goods and services.

Notwithstanding the short- to medium-term economic headwinds, we are optimistic about the long-term future of the Singapore retail real estate market. It will continue to be supported by ongoing inward migration, household income growth, coupled with low levels of retail supply growth ensuring occupancy remains high and providing conditions for long term rental growth.

On 22 September 2023 and 4 October 2023, FCT entered into sale and purchase agreements with unrelated third parties in relation to the divestment of interest in H-REIT and accordingly, investment in H-REIT was reclassified to "Assets held for sale" as at 30 September 2023.

FCT announced the completion of the divestment of its entire interest in H-REIT on 6 December 2023.

H-REIT's property portfolio consists of six shopping centres in the Northern, Central and Southern Regions of Peninsular Malaysia. These six shopping centres are Subang Parade (Selangor), Mahkota Parade (Melaka), Wetex Parade (Johor), Central Square (Kedah), Kulim Central (Kedah) and Segamat Central (Johor).

The properties in H-REIT portfolio have a total NLA of approximately 2.0 million sf and a combined value of approximately RM1,206.1 million ($351.4 million).

# Risk Management

Effective risk management is a fundamental part of Frasers Centrepoint Trust and its subsidiaries' ("FCT Group") business strategy. Key risks, mitigating measures and management actions are continually identified, reviewed and monitored by management of the Manager (the "Management") as part of the Manager's enterprise-wide risk management (the "ERM") framework. Recognising and managing risks are central to the business and for protecting Unitholders' interests.

# Governance and Oversight

The Board of Directors of the Manager (the "Board") is responsible for the governance of risks and ensuring that the Manager maintains a sound system of risk management and internal controls. The Manager has established a sound system of risk management and internal controls comprising procedures and processes to safeguard FCT Group's assets and the interests of FCT and its Unitholders. The Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee (the "ARCC") reviews and reports to the Board on the adequacy and effectiveness of such controls, including financial, compliance, operational and information technology controls, and risk management procedures and systems, taking into consideration the recommendations of both internal and external auditors.

# Risk Management

As part of the risk management process, Management is responsible for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting risks to the ARCC. This process is facilitated through a web-based corporate risk scorecard system which enables the reporting of risks and risk status on a common platform in a consistent and cohesive manner. Management is also responsible for the implementation of the risk management process and ensuring that the risk management framework is adequate and effective to provide assurance to the ARCC and the Board that material and relevant risks are identified and managed.

Apart from the ERM process, each acquisition or divestment transaction is also subjected to a comprehensive due diligence review where the relevant and material risks associated with the transaction are identified and assessed.

FCT Group's ERM framework promotes a risk management culture. The Manager works closely with Frasers Property Limited's Group Risk Management Team to conduct workshops where necessary to reinforce and enhance risk management knowledge and management principles. Risk Management E-learning modules are rolled out for new and existing employees to enhance risk awareness and capability.

In our approach towards business continuity management, the Manager identifies and maps end-to-end dependencies that support the critical business services, prioritising the recovery of our business services and functions based on their criticality to minimise the degree of disruption, safeguard Unitholders' interests and maintain the safety and soundness of FCT. FCT Group conducts regular and comprehensive testing to ensure response and recovery arrangements are robust.

# Key Risks

Some of the key risks, including those related to material sustainability factors, that the Manager has been actively monitoring in FY2023 include:

# Macroeconomic Risk

While FCT Group's portfolio is predominantly in Singapore, volatility in global economies, rising geo-political tensions and global inflationary pressures can have impact on the domestic economy. Coupled with rapidly changing retail market trends and a limited pool of prospective tenants, this results in a challenging business climate with higher business costs.

The Manager actively monitors the macroeconomic trends, policies, regulatory changes and retail market trends, as well as continuously seeks to strengthen FCT Group's competitiveness through active lease management and asset enhancement works.

# Operational Risk

Any unanticipated significant disruption to the operations of the properties will impact business continuity and profitability.

The Manager has established a set of standard operating procedures designed to identify, monitor, report and manage the operational risks associated with the day-to-day management and maintenance of the properties. These procedures cover various areas such as workplace safety and security incidents.

These procedures and guidelines are regularly reviewed and benchmarked against industry best practices to ensure relevance and effectiveness. The Manager remains vigilant towards making the properties safe and secure for the tenants, customers, vendors, employees and any other third parties. The Manager has in

place crisis management and business continuity plans, with clear protocols of activation in the event of emergencies. In addition, insurance policies are in place to mitigate claims and/or losses resulting from unforeseen events.

# Human Capital Risk

A competent management team is a key factor in achieving FCT's business objectives and the Manager faces the risk of loss of key management personnel and the inability to attract / retain talent for its management team.

The Manager has in place a performance management framework and development system for its staff and implemented competitive reward schemes to attract and retain appropriate talent for the business. There is also an annual talent review process to identify key leadership and business critical positions. Regular training sessions and development opportunities are also provided to upgrade the skills and knowledge of the staff. An organisational culture survey was rolled out in 2023 to measure employee engagement and sentiments with the aim to shape a purpose-led culture aligned with our business strategy.

# Fraud and Corruption Risk

To safeguard FCT Group's assets and FCT's and its Unitholders' interests, the Manager does not condone any acts of fraud, corruption or bribery by employees in the course of our business activities. The Manager adheres to the various policies and guidelines established by Frasers Property Limited, including a Code of Business Conduct and an Anti-Bribery Policy, to guide employees on business practices, standards and conduct expected during their employment.

The Manager has put in place a Whistle-Blowing Policy ("Whistle-Blowing Policy"). The Whistle

Blowing Policy provides an independent feedback channel through which matters of concern about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting, suspected fraud and corruption or other matters may be raised by employees and any other persons in confidence and in good faith, without fear of reprisal. The ARCC reviews and ensures that independent investigations and appropriate follow-up actions are carried out. More details can be found in the Corporate Governance section of this Annual Report on pages 139 to 178.

# Liquidity Risk

Capital and liquidity management are an integral part of FCT's business to achieve its objectives. Insufficient liquidity will result in FCT Group's inability to meet its debt obligations and hence its survival.

In ensuring a prudent financial structure for FCT Group, the Manager adheres closely to the covenants in the loan agreements and Appendix 6 (Investment: Property Funds) of the Code on Collective Investment Schemes (the "CIS") issued by Monetary Authority of Singapore. In addition, the Manager proactively manages FCT Group's cashflow position and liquidity requirements.

In view of the challenges posed by the global inflationary pressures, the Management regularly conducted stress testing to assess and track the possible impact of the macroeconomic environment on the FCT Group's liquidity and cashflow. Capital and liquidity management remain priorities for FCT Group.

The Manager actively monitors its debt maturity profile and operating cashflows. FCT Group has undrawn revolving credit facilities totaling $488.4 million as of 30 September 2023 to ensure adequacy of liquidity reserves to

finance FCT Group's operations, capital expenditures, asset enhancement initiatives ("AEIs") and any other unforeseen short-term obligations. FCT Group's liquidity is supported by its long-term banking relationships and track record of strong access to the debt capital market.

Please refer to page 40 under Capital Resources section on the various sources of funds. The Manager continues to comply with its policy of spreading out the debts maturing in a single year.

# Interest Rate Risk

Rising interest rates and cost of capital can impact the profitability of FCT Group and the distributable income available to Unitholders. Interest rate risk is proactively managed by the Manager with the primary objective of limiting the extent to which net interest expense could be affected by adverse movements in interest rates. The Manager closely monitors the interest rate environment with support from Frasers Property Limited's Group Treasury to mitigate the difficulties in raising debt at reasonable cost in view of the ongoing interest rate hike. As at 30 September 2023,  $63.0\%$  of the total borrowings are on fixed interest rates.

# Credit Risk

Credit risk arising from uncollectible debts of tenants affects FCT Group's cashflow and profitability. The Manager monitors the debt levels on an ongoing basis and remains vigilant in its debt collection procedures. Credit evaluations are performed before lease agreements are entered into with tenants or before lease terms with existing tenants are extended. Credit risk is also mitigated by collecting rental deposits via cash or banker's guarantee from the tenants.

# Investment Risk

FCT is exposed to the risk of lower returns from its investments than expected. As FCT Group grows its investment portfolio via the acquisition of new properties and other forms of permitted investments, all investment opportunities are subject to a disciplined and rigorous appraisal process. All investment proposals are evaluated based on a comprehensive set of investment criteria including alignment with FCT's investment mandate, asset quality, expected returns, sustainability of asset performance, asset sustainability attributes, environmental impact metrics, and future growth potential, having due regard to market conditions and outlook.

# Compliance Risk

FCT Group is subject to relevant laws and regulations including the Listing Manual of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited, the CIS, the tax rulings issued by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore and the upcoming Lease Agreements for Retail Premises Act 2023. Any changes to these regulations may affect FCT Group's operations and results. The Manager has in place policies and procedures to facilitate compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Management keeps abreast of latest developments in relevant laws and regulations through training, attending talks and briefings.

# Information Systems and Cybersecurity Risk

Cybersecurity incidents or system failures can lead to business disruptions, financial loss and / or regulatory penalties.

Digital disruption and the future of work that are enabled by digital technology offer new opportunities and challenges for our business.

# Risk Management

Frasers Property, of which the Manager is part of, continues to build digital capabilities and invest in new technologies to ensure that the FCT Group's business is future-ready. This includes embracing of cloud technology to provide a higher level of business agility, scalability, cost competitiveness. Group-wide policies, standards and procedures and security technology solutions have been put in place to ensure the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of Information Technology ("IT") systems, as well as to ensure that cybersecurity threats are managed. Disaster recovery plans and incident management procedures have been developed and are tested regularly. Measures and considerations have also been taken to enable effective privileged access monitoring, patch management, data security, data protection and safeguard against prolonged service unavailability of critical IT systems.

Periodic IT security training sessions are conducted for new and existing employees to raise IT security awareness on the evolving threats landscape. External professional service providers are engaged to conduct independent vulnerability assessment and penetration tests to further strengthen the IT systems.

At the management level, the appointed Chief Information Officer and Chief Information Security Officer manage the technology risks of FCT Group and take all decisions in accordance with the risk appetite approved by the Board. The Manager monitors the compliance with applicable regulations on an ongoing basis, using the toolkits and quarterly compliance checklists created for periodic reporting.

# Environment and Climate Change Risk

Climate change and potentially catastrophic weather events expose FCT Group to environmental and sustainability risks, including the impact of rising operating costs from physical and transition risks of climate change. The growing emphasis of government regulations on sustainability, environmental laws and green finance laws creates a challenge to meet regulatory requirements amidst rising cost from capital expenditure.

In order to meet the stringent green building and green loans requirements for sustainability financing, the Manager constantly monitors green finance trends and compliance requirements of green building. Training and workplace bulletins are in place to update employees' sustainability knowledge and align operational objectives to the strategic direction of the FCT Group. Please refer to pages 95 to 138 under the Sustainability Report section on the FCT Group's effort to comply with the Environmental Risk Management Guidelines.

# Board Statement GRI 2-22

# Dear Stakeholders,

FY2023 has been a challenging yet fulfilling year for FCT. While the macro-economic environment remains volatile, marked by inflation and surges in energy costs, and extreme climate change events pose threats to our assets and supply chains, we remain steadfast in our commitment to press on with our sustainability endeavours, and ensure that we continue to deliver on our shared Purpose - Inspiring experiences, creating places for good. In FY2023, we have continuously driven portfolio and built a resilient, diversified portfolio of quality assets while also engaging in green and sustainable financing.

FCT's FY2023 Sustainability Report provides an overview of our sustainability performance and efforts throughout the year. Beyond that, it also highlights how we continue to further our sustainability goals through the three pillars of our Sponsor Frasers Property's ESG Framework - Acting Progressively, Consuming Responsibly and Focusing on People.

As one of the largest suburban retail mall owners in Singapore, we are cognisant of our pivotal role in minimising our environmental impact, whether it involves greening our properties, or imparting eco-conscious practices to employees, tenants, shoppers and the broader community.

We continue to embrace innovation and leverage technology to optimise energy efficiency at our properties. This encompasses key initiatives such as upgrading the cooling systems as well as retrofitting more energy efficient LED lighting at selected properties. These dedicated efforts align us with Frasers Property's strategic ESG goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

As testament to our efforts, we are proud to share that we have achieved a 5-Star Rating at the 2023 GRESB Real Estate Assessment, marking the third consecutive year that we have attained this rating. This assessment is significant as it enables our stakeholders to benchmark FCT's performance with its global real estate peers in the same sector. FCT has also maintained its "A" rating from the MSCI ESG Ratings in 2023, underscoring our progress in effectively managing ESG risks and opportunities.

We have also made progress in our green financing efforts. The proportion of green loans in FCT's total borrowing rose to  $55.6\%$  as at 30 September 2023 from  $31.9\%$  last year. We expect to further increase this proportion of green loans going forward. We have also partnered with OCBC on a new green financing solution that packages carbon credits with a green loan that helps support our net-zero carbon goal.

In line with our sustainability roadmap, we continue to align this year's sustainability disclosures with the TCFD recommendations.

As we advance on our sustainability journey, we continue to keep our people at the heart of all we do. We uphold stringent workplace health and safety standards across our business, including having all properties certified with ISO 45001 occupational health and safety management systems. We recognise FCT's influence in partnering our tenants in driving greater environmental and social impact. Tenants from FCT malls participated in the inaugural "Building a Greener Retail Ecosystem Together" event organised by Frasers Property Singapore. We also seek to engage and contribute to the local communities where we operate. FCT malls are contributing to an industry-first Inclusion Champions Programme by Frasers Property Singapore, geared towards creating more inclusive spaces and experiences for members of the community who have different needs.

Reflecting on the past year, we are heartened by the progress we have made towards our sustainability goals. We are grateful for the invaluable support of our employees and stakeholders, which have enabled us to remain steadfast in our commitment to sustainable practices. Moving forward, we embrace the opportunity to accelerate change and create a positive impact through our business by further integrating ESG factors into our strategy and operations. While we acknowledge that there will be ongoing and new challenges on the horizon, we are confident that we can chart a sustainable path forward and create long-term value for all our stakeholders.

# Building A Resilient Future: Our Approach To ESG

# Embedding Sustainability Within Our Core

As one of Singapore's largest suburban retail mall owners, we are cognisant of our duty as responsible stewards of the environment and of the communities that we serve. This underpins our commitment to sustainability and responsible business practices. Our sustainability strategy is grounded in Frasers Property's Sustainability Framework (the "Framework") which comprises three core pillars: Acting Progressively, Consuming Responsibly and Focusing on People. These pillars encompass ESG focus areas which we have identified as most pertinent for our business and operations.

# Managing Sustainability GRI 2-9

# Sustainability Governance

Ensuring transparency, accountability and integrity alongside our sustainability approach is a tenet of good governance and demonstrates our efforts to build trust with stakeholders. FCT has put in place a sustainability governance structure to ensure we align our sustainability goals with the overall business strategy and integrate sustainability considerations into our long-term plan and operations.

To ensure a cohesive governance approach, we collaborate closely with our Sponsor, Frasers Property. This alignment extends to our shared sustainability agenda, guided by the Group Sustainability Steering Committee ("SSC"). This committee, consisting of Chief Executive Officers across the business units in Frasers Property as well as other senior management, convenes six times annually to drive Group-wide sustainability strategies, and monitor sustainability performance against key metrics and endorse action plans throughout the Group. The SSC is supported by the Frasers Property's ESG Team, which also provides support to FCT on the execution of their ESG strategies and ensure alignment between Group and business unit ESG activities.

The management team of FCT collaborates closely with the Sustainability Steering Committee of Frasers Property Singapore. This strategic partnership entails close cooperation to determine and drive the sustainability framework and objectives within FCT's portfolio. The Frasers Property Singapore SSC, led by senior management including FCAM's Chief Executive Officer, plays a pivotal role in providing guidance and leadership to the Sustainability Working Committee ("SWC"). The SWC comprises management and executive personnel who are responsible for implementing action plans and closely monitoring performance against key performance indicators applicable to retail malls under FCT. Our Board of Directors ("Board") provides the strategic direction and oversees the identification, monitoring and the management of environmental, social and governance material factors central to achieving FCT's sustainability objectives.

# Participation in Membership Associations and Alignment with Recognised Standards  
GRI 2-28

FCT, whether independently or through Frasers Property, supports and engages with various global movements to advance sustainability initiatives. Such participation in local and international initiatives, as well as partnerships with industry bodies, enable us to leverage the insights and knowledge to drive meaningful changes. These collaborations play a role in fulfilling our sustainability commitments.

# REIT Association of Singapore (REITAS)

REITAS serves as the representative advocate for Singapore's REIT (S-REIT) sector, facilitating member engagement in policy consultations. REITAS supports the growth of the S-REIT industry by improving transparency and governance for investor decision-making, collaborating with regulators for industry-friendly policies. FCT plays an active role as a member of REITAS, participating in industry events organised by the association as well as relevant surveys e.g. by the regulators which seek to gather feedback from SREITs. FCT, through Frasers Property, is also represented on REITAS' Sustainability Taskforce.

# Materiality Assessment

GRI 3-1, 3-2

FCT monitors its operating landscape for any changes or developments that may impact on our business, stakeholders, and our material ESG topics. In FY2022, Frasers Property led a group-wide review of material topics to determine if any new topics have emerged, or whether there has been a shift in the importance and impact of existing topics. The review process comprised a global market review of relevant key sustainability trends as well as surveys and interviews with internal and external stakeholders. The findings affirmed that FCT's material topics remain relevant and aligned to stakeholder expectations.

# Risk-Based Management

# Our Approach

GRI 3-3

FCT has in place policies and procedures to enable us to proactively address environmental, social, and governance-related risks while minimising potential negative impacts. FCT's dedication to the highest levels of integrity and transparency is consistently upheld throughout our portfolio. We strive to adhere to principles of fairness and ethical conduct and have a zero-tolerance stance towards fraud and corruption.

FCT's risk management framework is overseen by the Board through the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee ("ARCC"). The ARCC ensures the quality and effectiveness of risk management practices and mitigating controls. Additionally, an enterprise risk management ("ERM") framework has been implemented to enhance our risk management capabilities. This involves continuous identification, assessment, and monitoring of key risks, along with corresponding control measures and management actions. As part of our ERM process, financial and operational key risk indicators have also been established to track our principal risk exposures. Discussions within the Board and Board Committees encompass various aspects, including business, financial performance, strategy, sustainability, environmental, social & governance, and technology risk management. Internal audit support is provided by the Frasers Property's internal audit department ("Group IA"), which conducts independent, objective assessments of internal controls, risk management, and governance practices.

Collaboration with the Frasers Property's Group Risk and Group Sustainability teams further strengthens our risk management approach and ensures alignment with ESG-related concerns. Since 2022, FCT's governance framework has included Technology Risk Management and Environmental Risk Management, mandated by the MAS. FCT's commitment to corporate governance is demonstrated through our continued participation as a signatory in the annual Corporate Governance Statement of Support, initiated by the Securities Investors Association (Singapore) ("SIAS"). Further details can be found in our Corporate Governance Report on pages 139 to 178 of the Annual Report.

To ensure the reliability of our data disclosure and sustainability reporting processes, we have sought independent external assurance of this Report for the third consecutive year. Our assurance is carried out by Ere-S Pte Ltd ("Ere-S"), with the engagement conducted under a limited level of assurance according to the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 ("ISAE 3000") guidelines. Please refer to pages 131 to 133 for assurance findings and observations.

All our properties also undergo third-party audits to be certified under the ISO 14001, ISO 45001 and ISO 50001 standards.

# Responsible Investment

Our Approach  
GRI 3-3

FCT acknowledges the significance of responsible investment in enhancing our competitive advantage and generating long-term value for both our business and stakeholders. We aim to integrate ESG considerations into our investment strategies, while exploring opportunities to green our portfolio and employ sustainable financing methods.

FCT endeavours to incorporate ESG considerations into our business decisions by aligning to green building certifications and benchmarking our performance through both local and internationally recognised certifications such as the BCA Green Mark and GRESB Real Estate Assessment. Additionally, we conduct regular assessments of all properties to ensure that we continuously adapt to the needs of our customers and tenants.

# Our Actions and Progress

# Adopting Green and Sustainable Financing

Our approach is guided by our Sustainable Finance Framework, which is designed to provide overarching criteria and guidelines for FCT. The framework has four core elements, namely: Use of Proceeds, Process for Project Evaluation and Selection, Management of Proceeds and Reporting. These elements come together to provide a comprehensive approach for financing new assets based on sustainable finance principles while tracking our environmental impacts.

Crucially, the Framework been externally assured to be in accordance with the relevant international principles and guidelines as follows:

$\triangleright$  Green Bond Principles ("GBP") 2021 and Sustainability Bond Guidelines ("SBG") 2021 by the International Capital Market Association ("ICMA"); and  
$\triangleright$  Green Loan Principles ("GLP") 2021 by the Loan Market Association, Asia Pacific Loan Market Association and Loan Syndications and Trading Association.

FCT has increased its proportion of green loans from  $31.9\%$  as at 30 September 2022 to  $55.6\%^{3}$  as at 30 September 2023 through refinancing of maturing loans with green loans.

Additionally, FCT has announced a partnership with OCBC on Singapore's first green financing solution which comprises a green loan and carbon credits. Under this green financing solution, proceeds from the green loan are used to refinance a maturing facility, finance asset enhancement initiatives and decarbonisation projects for FCT's Tampines 1 retail mall as well as other general corporate purposes.

# Benchmarking FCT's Performance with the GRESB Real Estate Assessment

Since 2019, FCT has been a participant of the annual GRESB Real Estate Assessment. The GRESB Real Estate Assessment is a globally recognised industry benchmark that is aligned with international reporting frameworks. The Assessment benchmarks real estate funds and companies worldwide based on information relating to their ESG performance and sustainability best practices. Seeking third party assessment from bodies such as GRESB is key to FCT's approach in affirming ESG standards and performance and encouraging greater accountability with our stakeholders.

FCT continued to report a strong performance in the 2023 GRESB Real Estate Assessment, achieving a score of 92 and attaining a 5-star rating for the third year in a row, while also scoring an 'A' for public disclosure. FCT aims to continue building on this momentum and continue to learn from our experiences and the wider industry as ESG standards evolve.

# Resilient Properties

# Our Approach

GRI 3-3

FCT is focused on addressing climate-related risks by forging close partnerships with its tenants/shoppers, suppliers as well as communities that may be potentially impacted by its operations. Through this approach, we believe that we can forge a more sustainable future.

As an investor and manager of real estate, enhancing the resilience of FCT's assets and operations against these impending threats is a key priority. In response, FCAM proactively integrate these risks into FCT's financial risk management processes. This entails harnessing climate risk data to identify, understand and manage FCT's portfolio's exposure to climate-related hazards. Through this, FCAM believes it can effectively measure and manage FCT's climate risks and opportunities, thereby delivering and preserving long-term value for its stakeholders.

FCT has set forth a series of climate objectives that closely align with Frasers Property's overarching sustainability goals. These goals include a commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

In parallel with these endeavours, FCT is aligning its disclosures with the recommendations outlined by TCFD. This is geared towards promoting greater transparency in its reporting.

# Advancing Green Practices in our Portfolio

FCT constantly seeks to improve the ESG performance of its portfolio by actively certifying its assets with recognised green building standards in Singapore. We have focused the efforts on attaining BCA Green Mark certification, which provides a comprehensive framework for assessing the overall environmental performance of new and existing buildings.

As of 30 September 2023, FCT's property portfolio is  $100\%$  BCA Green Mark-certified by GFA. The Green Mark certifications achieved by the respective FCT property are as follows:

<table><tr><td>Green Mark Certification</td><td>Properties</td></tr><tr><td>Green Mark Platinum</td><td>·Tiong Bahru Plaza
·Central Plaza
·Century Square
·White Sands
·Hougang Mall</td></tr><tr><td>Green Mark GoldPlus</td><td>·Tampines 1
·Waterway Point
·NEX</td></tr><tr><td>Green Mark Gold</td><td>·Northpoint City North Wing*
·Changi City Point*
·Causeway Point*</td></tr></table>

* This certification is under BCA's revised scheme Green Mark 2021, also known as BCA GM: 2021. To be certified under this revised scheme, buildings will have to meet higher minimum Energy Efficiency levels as well as score sufficient points in the scheme's sustainability sections. The certification will apply to new and existing buildings and developments as well as to those in operation or those developments and buildings that have been previously certified under BCA Green Mark.

In addition, all of FCT's Centre Management Offices participated in the Singapore Environment Council's Eco Office Certification, which guides offices in implementing environmentally friendly practices. This certification takes place once every two years, and we last obtained it in 2022. We are committed to maintaining our environmental commitment, and as such, we will be actively pursuing re-certification in 2024.

In the most recent certification, five centres attained the highest Elite ranking, and three attained the Champion ranking. This demonstrates our dedication to sustainable and eco-friendly practices, and we aim to further enhance our environmental efforts in the upcoming certification in 2024.

We also continuously identify opportunities for improvement of efficiencies across all our properties through regular reviews. This ensures that we stay attuned to the changing needs of customers and tenants. These include AEI to upgrade properties and optimise performance through the installation of environmentally efficient infrastructure.

# Acting Progressively

# Innovation

# Our Approach

GRI 3-3

FCT, in partnership with Frasers Property, strives to improve operational efficiency and to reduce reliance on manpower through innovation and leveraging technology.

# Fostering Innovation and Design Thinking in Our Employees

We collaborate closely with Frasers Property's innovation team to employ design thinking approach in our problem solving processes and to equip our team with more tools and skills to solve problems.

# Adapting to consumer's evolving needs through Omnichannel Retail

FCT embraces omnichannel retail. This approach enhances convenience and accessibility for shoppers, offering diverse order fulfilment options. For retailers and F&B operators in our malls, omnichannel retailing expands customer reach, elevating sales productivity of physical spaces, and introducing click-and-collect and delivery for added convenience. It also furnishes valuable data and analytics, enabling informed business decisions regarding product assortment and expansion. This integrated approach improves sales, enhances business efficiency, brand loyalty and shopper satisfaction.

We continue to enhance our Frasers loyalty program, the Frasers Experience, which complements our brick-and-mortar malls to promote the omnichannel retail experience.

# Harnessing technology for operational efficiency

With increasing challenges from rising operating and manpower costs, driving cost reduction through innovation and use of technology become crucial. We have been working with Frasers Property and multiple industry partners to explore various initiatives to optimise complex processes, reduce inefficiencies in our building management systems, use of technology to replace repetitive and routine work and use of smart technology to reduce reliance on manpower in surveillance and security. One example is the initiative call "SMART Lifts", which uses data analytics to determine the optimal quarterly maintenance regime for the elevators based on data such as usage and wear rate. This results in tremendous amount of cost savings and reduction of wastage over the long run. Other initiatives include food waste valorisation which creates circular economy in food waste management and water valve efficiency initiative that regulate air and water pressure in pipes to improve flow efficiency and reduce water bills. The projected savings of these initiatives when fully implemented is approximately $1 million per annum.

# Leveraging Technology to Achieve ESG Goals

In collaboration with DBS/POSB, our retail team has launched the Eco-Perks programme on the Frasers Experience (FRx) mobile application. This initiative aims to nurture eco-consciousness as a part of a wider initiative to contribute towards zero waste and carbon reduction in the long term.

FRx Eco-Perks offers shoppers a transformative gateway to embark on their sustainability journey, while incentivising them to participate in a wide selection of eco-friendly activities. These activities span from meaningful endeavours such as food donation drives to embracing conscious dining and interactive upcycling events.

Our utilisation of technology through the FRx application has enabled us to engage a wider audience of shoppers and amplify our sustainability impact. In this manner, we have successfully engaged more than 14,300 community members, resulting in a substantial reduction of nearly  $19,000\mathrm{kg}$  of food waste.

# Consuming Responsibly

As a leading suburban retail REIT in Singapore, FCT aims to be a positive example in its sustainability and ESG efforts and disclosures. We want to proactively collaborate with our stakeholders in reducing our consumption in energy and water, cut our carbon and greenhouse gas emissions and to promote recycling. These are in line with our broader Group goal to be net-zero by 2050.

# Energy and Carbon

# Our Approach

GRI 3-3

We note that the retail industry has a significant role to play in mitigating climate impacts. FCT has embarked on a journey to achieve net-zero by 2050. Our approach encompasses a diverse range of strategies aimed at reducing energy consumption and enhancing our operational efficiency. Our commitment extends beyond our business activities as well, as we actively endeavour to inspire and empower employees, shoppers, tenants and suppliers to embrace eco-conscious practices and choices, thereby fostering a culture of environmental responsibility.

In collaboration with Frasers Property, FCT has embarked on a journey towards decarbonising our operations and achieving net-zero by 2050. Our carbon inventory development is based on the requirements within the widely-utilised GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard as well as Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard. The operational control approach is adopted for carbon inventory establishment. This ensures that we take ownership of emissions generated by activities from which economic profit is derived.

Since FY2021, FCT has established a comprehensive roadmap that details our carbon reduction strategies as well as specific targets and timelines. The development of this roadmap entailed a process which involved initial identification and prioritisation of strategies specific to the retail sector. Subsequently, we drew upon industry-leading carbon reduction pathways to develop our absolute and sectoral decarbonisation pathways. Employing a science-based methodology, we also modelled alternative scenarios to project potential emission reductions up until the year 2035.

Targeted at reducing our Scopes 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions, our decarbonisation strategies include improving energy efficiencies, increasing our renewable energy mix, addressing tenant energy consumption patterns, and promoting sustainable procurement as well as proper waste and water management.

In order to better understand our carbon inventory structure and generate meaningful insights for decarbonisation, we strive to enhance the accuracy and quality of our database. More than  $95\%$  of environmental disclosure in this report is derived from actual data, which demonstrates our effort in setting up a high quality ESG data management system.

# Our Actions and Progress

# Energy

GRI 302-1, 302-2, 302-3

At common areas, a large proportion of FCT's energy consumption<sup>6</sup> is attributed to electricity consumption. Due to higher occupancies in FY2023, our properties purchased 3.6 kL of diesel and consumed 62 GWh of grid electricity. This leads to an overall energy consumption of 224,000 GJ and the corresponding energy intensity remained relatively unchanged at 0.7 GJ/m<sup>2</sup>.

At tenant-controlled areas, we have recorded a total of 103 GWh of electricity consumption. With higher transparency on data tracking and more vigilant monitoring process in place, we are on track to our goal of reducing the energy intensity of our portfolio by  $1.5\%$  per annum by 2024 against a FY2019 baseline.

To reduce our reliance on fossil-fuel based energy, we have been generating renewable energy on-site via solar panels. In FY2023, 147 MWh of solar energy was generated and consumed at Tiong Bahru Plaza. We are heartened to observe a continuous increase in renewable energy generated in our portfolio and strive to further expand capacity over time by implementing sustainable energy infrastructure on more properties.

Hougang Mall achieved its inaugural BCA's Green Mark certification this year with the Platinum rating. This accomplishment reflects our continuous commitment to enhancing our properties' energy efficiency. FCT has upgraded the mall's cooling system, eliminating individual water-cooled package units in favour of a more efficient chiller plant, which is projected to operate  $34.4\%$  more efficiently and save 3,600 GJ of energy annually. Additionally, common area lights will be retrofitted with LEDs, increasing lighting power efficiency from  $14\%$  to  $48.5\%$ , saving 360 GJ of energy. These efforts have led to a remarkable annual reduction of 395 tonnes of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  e in carbon emissions and a 3,485 GJ decrease in energy consumption at Hougang Mall.

On a longer term project, two of FCT malls, Century Square and Tampines 1, participated in the SP Group-led project to develop Singapore's first brownfield Distributed District Cooling (DDC) network in Tampines Central. The DDC is a centralised cooling system for a network of interconnected buildings. In the case of the Tampines DDC, two of FCT's malls - Century Square and Tampines 1 and together with another building, act as the injection nodes for chilled water to the DDC which comprises 14 buildings. According to a white paper<sup>7</sup> feasibility study conducted by Temasek and the SP Group, the Tampines DDC could potentially achieve  $17\%$  lower energy consumption, an  $18\%$  reduction in carbon emissions annually and $4.3 million annually from energy savings, reduction in equipment replacement and maintenance costs and potential earnings from freeing up chiller plant space, which can be converted into retail or office space.

Scope 1 includes direct emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by FCT such as diesel purchased and refrigerant top-ups at its assets, while Scope 2 comprises indirect emissions from purchased electricity consumed by the operational activities of FCT at its managed buildings.

In FY2023, our total Scope  $1^{8}$  and 2 location-based carbon emissions amounted to 27 and 25,168 tonnes of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  equivalent (tCO $_2$ e) respectively, representing a  $2.2\%$  increase as compared to FY2022. FCT's Scopes 1 and 2 emissions intensity was  $76.6 \, \mathrm{kgCO}_{2} \, \mathrm{e} / \mathrm{m}^2$ .

A total of  $46 \mathrm{ktCO}_{2} \mathrm{e}$  of Scope 3 emissions were produced, across four categories, a slight increase from FY2022. Of the four categories, majority of FCT's Scope 3 emissions stemmed from category 13 which includes tenants' emissions at downstream leased assets, followed by category 3, which refers to fuel- and energy-related activities that FCT engages in. We have encouraged all our employees to take part in the Group's annual employee commute survey, which aims to compute our category  $7^{9}$  of Scope 3 emissions based on our full-time permanent employees commuting behaviour. With a response rate of  $79\%$ , the emission of this category is estimated to be  $23 \mathrm{tCO}_{2} \mathrm{e}$ .

# Water

# Our Approach

GRI 3-3, 303-1, 303-3

As global demand for water continues to grow, the need for responsible and smarter water management practices becomes more pertinent than ever. At FCT, we acknowledge the importance of effective water management given that many aspects of our operations such as sanitation and cooling of our properties rely on a stable supply of water. According to Singapore's Public Utilities Board (PUB), it is estimated that by 2065, Singapore's total water demand could double. Against this backdrop, FCT targets to carefully manage our water use and has adopted a strategic approach to water management, enhancing the efficiency, resilience and long-term value of our portfolio.

We aim to achieve a  $25 \%$ reduction in water intensity by 2035, from FY2019 baseline. As of FY2023, we have achieved a reduction of  $16.3 \%$ from FY2019 baseline. All our properties have been granted PUB’s Water Efficient Building (WEB) Certification. The WEB includes industry benchmarks and best practice sharing,

encouraging organisations to take a more active role in reducing water consumption.

# Our Actions and Progress

GRI 303-1, 303-3

In FY2023, the total volume of water consumed across our properties was 903 megalitres $^{10}$ , with water intensity of  $2.7 \, \text{kL/m}^2$ , an increase of  $8.7\%$  from last year. This change is due to the increase in tenancy and activities across FCT-managed properties.

FCT continues to undertake a range of initiatives to reduce water consumption across our properties, attesting to our continued efforts to responsible water management. This includes adoption of the ISO 14001 process and best practices for water conservation such as incorporating automated irrigation systems at selected malls, and actively monitoring and benchmarking water usage. Additionally, we prioritise the installation of water-efficient fittings with an "Excellent" rating under the Water Efficiency Labelling Scheme (WELS) to minimise water consumption wherever applicable. We also continuously promote the use of non-potable water sources such as  $\mathrm{NEWater}^{11}$  and rainwater, reducing the strain on freshwater resources. In FY2023, we consumed close to 355 kilolitres of  $\mathrm{NEWater}$ . Moving beyond infrastructural and operational enhancements, we have proactively taken steps to raise awareness about water conservation by encouraging sustainable behaviour among our employees, tenants and shoppers.

# Waste

# Our Approach

GRI 3-3, 306-1, 306-3

While the retail industry may be a major contributor to waste production, it also has the greatest potential to be a gamechanger in advancing circular economy principles. FCT recognises the pivotal role it plays in this landscape and strives to be at the forefront of the retail sector's transformation by committing to waste reduction and increased recycling rates. We actively encourage tenants and shoppers to engage in responsible consumption and engage with them to foster circular economy practices that align with our broader environmental goals.

During the year, we also introduced the 'ChopValue' initiative at participating establishments within our malls, which repurposes discarded chopsticks into eco-friendly products.

# Our Actions and Progress

GRI 306-2, 306-3, 306-4, 306-5

We track waste generated and waste sent for recycling across our properties. In FY2023, the total waste generated from our properties was 17,657 tonnes $^{12}$ , an increase of  $5.9\%$  from FY2022. Our waste streams comprise mixed recyclables and general waste generated from day-to-day operational business activities. In Singapore, general waste is usually sent to waste-to-energy plants for incineration. The increase of waste intensity to  $53.7\mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{m}^2$  can be attributable to higher volume of activities observed in the malls. We sent 2,189 tonnes of waste for recycling, including  $98\%$  of paper and cardboard and  $2\%$  of metal, plastic and wood. Our commitment to promote recycling behaviours is evident from the increase in recycling rate of  $12.4\%$ , up from FY2022's  $11.9\%$ , FCT strives to continue our efforts in minimising environmental impact and advancing responsible waste management practices.

# Consuming Responsibly

# Partnerships to Reduce Waste

On July 14, 2023, over 100 partners and tenants from 13 Frasers Property Singapore malls came together for a sustainability-focused retail tenant engagement event. During a panel discussion, representatives from key partners such as McDonald's Singapore, FairPrice Group, and Green Lab shared insights on how they collaborate to embed sustainability into their business practices. The event highlighted initiatives like FairPrice's "no plastic bag" scheme, McDonald's use of green materials, and showcased a united commitment to building a more sustainable retail ecosystem.

At FCT, we take pride and place great emphasis on collaboration and partnership in the pursuit of our sustainability goals. Through such engagements, we not only acknowledge our business partners' efforts, but also actively foster a dynamic environment where ideas and actions converge towards a greener future.

# Materials and Supply Chain

# Our Approach

As a retail mall owner, we recognise our role in shaping our supply chain and the use of materials throughout our value chain. The oversight of these materials and supply chain activities is crucial for effective collaboration with our suppliers. This collaborative effort ultimately empowers us to implement responsible sourcing practices, thereby reducing risks along the value chain.

Our Responsible Sourcing Policy is aligned with Frasers Property's Responsible Sourcing Policy, guiding our approach to sustainable procurement. By mapping our value chain, we can identify our key suppliers based on the level of environmental and social risks. This ensures that our suppliers are compliant with the relevant regulations and are aligned with our core values. Our Responsible Sourcing Policy outlines our expectations of our suppliers across four key areas:

# Business ethics and integrity

Upholding business ethics and ensuring that business is lawfully conducted and with integrity

# Our Actions and Progress

In FY2023, Frasers Property set a new goal of engaging  $75\%$  of suppliers across the Group (by spend) on the Responsible Sourcing Policy by the end of FY2025. This will be achieved through our supplier e-learning programme, designed to strengthen sustainability awareness and capabilities across our supply chain, along with other direct engagement strategies. We will be onboarding our suppliers onto the programme, which aims to encourage and equip our stakeholders to implement sustainable business practices. This will serve as a springboard towards reducing environmental and social impacts in our value chain.

# Biodiversity

# Our Approach

The protection and promotion of biodiversity are critical in today's world, in terms of creating resilient urban spaces: biodiversity provides a multitude of ecosystem services in cities, such as the enhancement of air quality, flood mitigation and reduction of the urban heat island effect. Yet, according to the World Economic Forum, the built environment sector is responsible for an alarming  $30\%$  of biodiversity loss globally. As a leading suburban retail mall operator in Singapore, FCT is cognisant of the growing importance of biodiversity conservation and its duty to mitigate its impact on the global ecosystem.

The introduction of the Kunming Montreal Global Biodiversity Index and the emergence of supporting frameworks such as the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) and the Science-Based Targets for Nature presents opportunities for FCT to better understand our biodiversity-related impacts. As part of our evolving goals, we are committed to exploring ways to measure and address our impacts on nature. We are dedicated to staying informed about emerging best practices and the latest research in this area. By deepening our understanding of the significance of biodiversity, we aim to lay the foundation for a more sustainable and responsible future.

# Our Actions and Progress

We support Frasers Property's ESG Goal of developing a framework by FY2025 to guide the assessment and prioritisation of biodiversity risks and opportunities. This framework will be a first step within a broader roadmap to promote sustainable use of biodiversity in FCT.

# Focusing on People

FCAM, the Manager of FCT, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Frasers Property, adopts a people-focused approach aimed at enhancing the satisfaction and well-being of our employees, tenants, customers and local communities. We strive to champion the holistic well-being of all stakeholders, aligning with Frasers Property's overarching purpose of "Inspiring experiences, creating places for good."

We are dedicated to nurturing a diverse and inclusive work environment that promotes growth and development for our staff. FCT upholds this commitment by engaging in fair employment practices while also nurturing a culture of continuous learning and development.

# Inclusion Champions Programme

FCT is committed to fostering a culture of inclusion through our participation in Frasers Property Singapore's Inclusion Champions Programme. This initiative aims to train staff to become "Inclusion Champions" who can help create more inclusive spaces and cater to community members with diverse needs. The programme is extended to frontline employees at Frasers Property Singapore's malls as well as its retail tenants.

Inclusion Champions undergo yearly inclusivity training, covering consumer inclusiveness, support for persons with dementia, and shoppers on the Autism Spectrum. These trainings are conducted in collaboration with organisations such as SG Enable, Dementia Singapore, and St Andrew's Autism Centre. Besides providing trainings, the programme drives efforts to transform malls into more accessible spaces through community consultation and partnerships with stakeholders.

# Inclusion Transformation Programme

Inclusion Champions will also support the effort by setting aside space within their outlets that function as dementia go-to points or transition points. Stores may also provide calm shopping hours on Mondays and Tuesdays, where in-store lighting is dimmed, and music volume is restricted to cater to the needs of the neurodivergent and elderly. As of 30 September 2023, FCT has 176 stores offering calm shopping hours, and 29 dementia go-to points comprising of tenants and customer service counters.

# Skills and Leadership

# Our Approach

Ensuring the holistic well-being of our stakeholders, including employees, tenants, shoppers and local communities, is a top priority at FCT. We are fully committed to providing a safe and healthy environment for people to work and enjoy. This dedication is exemplified through our stringent workplace safety practices and our ongoing efforts to uphold the highest safety standards across all our business operations.

# Upholding occupational health and safety standards across our properties

GRI 403-1, 403-2, 403-4, 403-5, 403-7

Frasers Property Singapore's Sustainability & Safety Working Committee is responsible for implementing environmental health and safety systems and policies as well as monitoring occupational health and safety performance. The Working Committee, which comprises representatives from FCAM and Frasers Property's retail management and commercial portfolios, meets monthly to discuss safety-related issues and identify areas for improvement. Overseeing the Working Committee is Frasers Property Singapore's Sustainability Steering Committee, which is responsible for making key decisions to drive sustainability goals.

# Hazard identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA)

To foster improved engagement between our senior leaders and site staff members, FCAM organises quarterly site safety walks. This initiative serves as a proactive measure to reinforce our commitment to safety at all levels of our organisation. During these safety walks, senior leaders actively interact with on-site staff to gain first-hand insights into safety measures, identify potential risks and ensure the effective implementation of safety protocols.

At our retail and office properties, an annual audit is conducted to assess compliance with the ISO 45001 occupational health and safety management system. These audits meticulously evaluate hazard identification and risk assessments at audit sites, providing a comprehensive overview of safety measures across our portfolio. Conducting these regular safety assessments enable us to maintain rigorous standards and continually foster a culture of safety, promoting a secure and healthy environment for all stakeholders.

In addition, all of our malls have been awarded the BizSAFE STAR by the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Council. To uphold our rigorous safety standards, we mandate that all contractors engaged in projects exceeding a certain value hold BizSAFE Level 3 certification. This stringent approach underscores our dedication to maintaining a secure and compliant working environment across our portfolio.

# Cultivating holistic employee health and well-being  
GRI 401-2, 403-6

FCAM aligns our human resource practices with those of Frasers Property. This includes an extensive range of welfare benefits, encompassing family care and parental leave, as well as life, medical, and accident insurance coverage. Adhering to Singapore-legislated social security policies, FCAM makes monthly contributions to our employees' Central Provident Fund accounts. This ensures that our employees receive the necessary financial support as mandated by the law.

Every full-time and contract employee of FCAM has access to a flexible benefit scheme, enabling them to personalise their benefits according to their needs. This includes options for increased personal insurance coverage, outpatient treatments, dental care, and health screenings. Those working for FCAM can also utilise the employer assistance programme (EAP) launched by Frasers Property. This initiative provides confidential professional counselling services, allowing employees an avenue to sound out should they face any personal challenges. Notably, since FY2022, access to this programme was extended to the immediate family members of our employees, cementing our commitment to supporting our employees' and their loved ones' holistic well-being.

Going a step further, FCAM has also implemented employee well-being programmes aimed at safeguarding the health of FCAM's employees. Collaborating with Frasers Property's Corporate Wellness team, we engage in activities that address physical, mental, financial, and environmental wellness aspects through the Corporate Wellness Framework. Furthermore, property-level well-being initiatives are organised for our stakeholders, highlighting our dedication to a holistic approach to well-being.

FCAM has implemented a policy allowing its staff to leave work earlier every last Friday of the month, enabling them to spend valuable time with their families. These initiatives underscore our commitment to prioritising our employee's mental and emotional health.

To gain comprehensive insights into the sentiments of our employees, Frasers Property conducts Group-wide employee surveys every two years. These surveys serve as a valuable tool for understanding employee perspectives in FCAM, gauging their satisfaction levels, and identifying areas for improvement. By engaging in these surveys, we demonstrate our commitment to fostering a supportive and fulfilling work environment that is responsive to the diverse requirements of our workforce.

# Our Actions and Progress

GRI 401-3, 403-9, 403-10

In FY2023, there were no work-related fatalities, high-consequence injuries, work-related ill health or significant safety-related non-compliance cases for our staff and contractors at FCT's properties. There was, however, two cases of recordable injury reported with 11 lost days incurred, taking place at our portfolio. In relation to this, appropriate follow-up action have been taken after the incidents to remediate, strengthen safety protocols and prevent further occurrence.

FCT has adopted parental leave policy, applicable to employees regardless of gender and nationality, to support employees with their childcare commitments. In both FY2022 and FY2023, no FCAM employees took parental leave.

# Creating Safer Spaces Through Innovation

Going beyond compliance, FCAM engages its employees in creating safer environments within our malls, empowering them to be safety advocates. This year, through the Frasers Property Singapore Workplace Safety and Health Award programme, teams from each of FCT's malls channelled their creativity into ideating solutions to address safety issues.

For instance, the team at Tampines 1 introduced Singapore's first magnetic bollards for escalators, mitigating safety risks associated with prams and trolleys. In collaboration with Singapore's Building and Construction Authority (BCA), these bollards were piloted at Tampines 1 for six months. During the pilot, it was observed that the bollards reduced incidences of shoppers using their prams and trolleys on escalators in the mall by approximately  $50\%$ , reducing the risk of escalator-related injuries.

At Tiong Bahru Plaza, a CCTV camera in the chiller plant room provided a safer way to monitor water seepage, reducing the need to work at heights. To further improve electrical safety in the chiller plant room, the team added an acrylic screen between the pumps and electrical boards, protecting the boards from potential water exposure in the event of a leak.

The team at Hougang Mall installed a secure platform with additional lighting, facilitating access to kitchen waste pipes on the property. This initiative improved visibility in the area, enabling safer collaboration between staff and contractors. The team also replaced a long roof ladder with two shorter ladders, and installed a separate platform to make equipment transportation safer and more efficient.

# Food Bank Volunteer Sessions with Tenants and Staff

Since 2019, we have been collaborating with the Food Bank Singapore to combat food waste. As part of this partnership, dedicated food bank donation boxes are placed at our commercial and retail properties to collect donated non-perishable food items. Leveraging their locations as key community hubs, our properties serve as convenient drop-off points for members of the public to donate food. All donations are redistributed to households in need, through organisations such as family service centres, soup kitchens, and other voluntary welfare organisations. As part of this initiative in December 2022, 200 staff volunteers spent meaningful time at the Food Bank Singapore to pack and deliver 1,000 bundles of food to households in need of food.

Additionally, in April 2023, our property manager collaborated with FCT tenants, such as McDonald's, Metro (Singapore), Koufu and Toys"R"Us Singapore. This collective effort resulted in the successful packing and distribution of 100 food bundles for the beneficiaries of NTUC Health Senior Day Care (Henderson). These initiatives highlight our unwavering dedication to addressing the often-overlooked issue of food insecurity in Singapore.

In March 2023, Northpoint City hosted the 'Happy Home Happy Earth' exhibition. In this exhibition, shoppers and members of the public had the opportunity to explore various 'rooms' showcasing informative displays. The content educated individuals on ways in which one can adopt more sustainable lifestyles at home and in their day-to-day practices. Activities in this exhibition ranged from engaging upcycling workshops to practical lessons on conducting basic electric repairs. This interactive and educational experience empowered visitors with the knowledge and skills needed to integrate sustainability into their daily lives.

# Coastal and Beach Clean-Ups

In April 2023, 40 employees from across Frasers Property engaged in our environmental conservation efforts. The event, which included representation from leaders which included Soon Su Lin, Chief Executive Officer of Frasers Property Singapore, Low Chee Wah, Chief Executive Officer Of Frasers Property Retail and Jack Lam, Chief Operating Officer (COO) Commercial, Frasers Property Singapore - participated in a beach clean-up along a section of East Coast Beach. Our commercial team simultaneously organised a separate coastal clean-up session specially for their tenants. In total, approximately 84 kilograms of litter were collected during these efforts.

# Independent Assurance Statement

To the management of Frasers Centrepoint Trust

Ere-S Pte Ltd (Ere-S) has undertaken an independent limited assurance on the content of Frasers Centrepoint Trust's ("FCT") Sustainability Report FY2023 ("the Report"). The engagement, which took place between September and November 2023, formed part of a wider assurance of Frasers Property Limited's Sustainability Report.

# Scope

The assurance encompassed the entire Report and focused on all figures, statements and claims related to sustainability during the reporting period October 2022 to September 2023. This included the environmental and social management approach and performance data related to the company's corporate office and portfolio of owned and managed properties (nine in total), covering the following topics: Energy, carbon emissions, water, waste, diversity, employment, training, and safety.

The assurance does not cover historical figures, such as in environmental charts showing FY2021 and FY2022 performance, which were restated to factor in updated and actual data from the relevant periods. Disclosures on projected performance and savings of individual projects or properties were also not covered.

Ere-S did not verify that the Report contained all information required by the GRI Standards for each disclosure listed in the Report's GRI Content Index, nor did Ere-S assess the validity of the information given in the Index, including the reasons for omissions. Similarly, the verification did not cover whether FCT's material issues, approaches and outcomes presented in the Report were specifically aligned with any other frameworks mentioned in the Report, such as the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework, the MAS guidelines, the GHG Protocol, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Figures or statements unrelated to sustainability were not covered in the assurance. These include organisation profile and corporate structure, corporate financial and economic performance, and, where applicable, technical descriptions and figures of construction, machineries, technologies, plants and production processes.

# Assurance criteria

The information was verified against the principles of Accuracy, Verifiability, Clarity, Completeness, Balance, Comparability, Sustainability Context and Timeliness as defined under the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards.

# Type of assurance

This assurance engagement was carried out to a limited level of assurance in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (ISAE 3000), Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information. A limited level assurance relies on desktop-based assessment and basic sampling that is sufficient to support the plausibility of the information.

# Assurance methodology

The assurance procedures and principles applied in this engagement are compliant with ISAE 3000 and are drawn from a methodology developed by Ere-S comprising the following steps:

1. Identifying and classifying data sets according to the relevant topics and the types of evidence required for the verification process.  
2. Carrying out virtual interviews and remote desktop-based data verification with the key data owners located at FCT's corporate office in Singapore.

# Specifically:

- Enquiring about the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the performance disclosures, related statements and the underlying measurement systems, data collection and quality control mechanisms.  
- Requesting evidence of data sources from the data owner or key functional manager, as well as explanations of data collection and calculation methods (including conversion factors, estimates, key assumptions and apportionment methodologies) to substantiate the figures and claims.  
- Taking a broad sampling of quantitative data to validate data sets and corresponding sources, as well as other supporting information.  
- Challenging the claims made in the Report and comparing the presented evidence (including calculation methods, criteria and assumptions) with external sources and information from other business units and portfolios covered in the wider assurance engagement or from previous assurance engagements conducted for FCT.

3. Assessing the collected data against the reporting criteria and providing recommendations for correction of the Report's content or for future improvement of the data collection and reporting procedures.  
4. Validating the performance disclosures submitted in the final version of the Report and, where applicable, verifying that Ere-S recommendations have been applied.

# Independent Assurance Statement

Ere-S was given access to the data management systems covering the entire FCT portfolio to allow our assurance team to evaluate the environmental and safety data more comprehensively. Social performance figures, such as those relating to workforce profile and training, as well as group-level initiatives disclosed in the Report, were verified in separate interviews as part of the assurance process for Frasers Property Limited.

Ere-S assessment of statements concerning the number (or absence) of complaints, incidents, breaches, and cases of non-compliance to policies and regulations related to environmental and social issues was founded on confirmation by key data owners and, where available, internal documents presented during the interviews.

FCT's stakeholder groups or their representatives were not interviewed during the assurance to assess the results of the engagement initiatives and the impact of the actions taken by the organisation.

# Limitations

A limited assurance provides a relatively lower level of confidence in an organisation's disclosures than a reasonable level of assurance (as used in financial auditing) would provide. The restricted extent, timeline and precision of audit procedures in a limited assurance can leave small misstatements undetected. In addition, sustainability-related evidence being more persuasive rather than conclusive, the assurance findings are more constrained to the judgement of the assurance practitioner.

To mitigate the associated risk of material misstatement in the disclosures being assessed during this engagement and to provide greater confidence in the accuracy of the information, including the application of the management approach, data collection methods, criteria and assumptions, further confirmation of the presented evidence was sought by Ere-S from multiple data owners and using other internal and external documentation.

# Responsibility and independence

This statement represents the independent opinion of Ere-S, whose responsibility was to provide the assurance, to express conclusions according to the agreed scope, and to prepare the assurance report and this assurance statement for the management of FCT alone and for no other purpose. The management of FCT was responsible for the preparation of the Report, including all statements and figures contained within it, and for the selection and application of the methods to collect and compile the performance data of its operations and properties. Ere-S was not involved in the development of the Report or any other aspects or projects related to the sustainability framework of FCT. The activities of Ere-S are independent of FCT and Frasers Property Limited and contain no financial interest in their business operations.

# Findings and Observations

The operations and portfolio of FCT are supported by policies, procedures, and objectives aligned with the global ESG strategy of the Group. We found evidence indicating the adoption of a risk-based approach for assessing social and environmental impacts and establishing mitigation measures, with a particular emphasis on responding to climate change. Other environmental and social aspects were also addressed, including through multiple platforms for engaging with stakeholders, such as employees, customers, investors, and government bodies. There was, however, less evidence of consistent two-way engagement with other stakeholder groups.

Based on our assessment, the content of the Report is sufficiently comprehensive, covering the company's operational boundaries and key material aspects. We found an overall high level of accuracy and verifiability in the performance disclosures and statements on the management approach, and important information could be traced back to supporting evidence, including source documents, data sets, and calculation methods. Confidence in the data quality was enforced by additional checks executed during the year by the main data owners on the environmental records provided by the properties' key functional managers.

No significant gaps or inconsistencies were found in the Report's disclosures, and the reporting team promptly applied Ere-S recommendations for minor corrections.

Ere-S commends this year's increase in reporting boundaries with the inclusion of fugitive emissions from cooling systems and the addition of GHG emissions categories in the Scope 3 disclosures. However, FCT could further improve the completeness of the Report content by disclosing more information on the indirect social and environmental impact in the rest of its value chain. Also, the Report could be more balanced, i.e., showing positive and negative information, with highlights on current gaps and negative performance, for example, related to internal targets or alignment with standards.

# Conclusion

On the basis of a limited assurance engagement consistent with the above-listed criteria, nothing has come to Ere-S attention that causes us not to believe that, in all material respects, Frasers Centrepoint Trust's Sustainability Report FY2023 provides a credible and fair representation of the organisation's sustainability profile and includes statements and figures that achieve an adequate level of reliability and accuracy.

A detailed assurance report containing the above findings and additional recommendations for improvement has been presented to the management of Frasers Centrepoint Trust.

Notes  
General

Discrepancies between individual figures and aggregates, or derived values, in the charts and tables of this report are due to rounding.

The FY2019 baseline was chosen because of the relatively complete dataset established and it was more representative of our usual business activities.  
- No mobile combustion considered for Scope 1 emissions as there are no owned vehicles. Stationary combustion is considered due to diesel usage for generators. Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU) emissions are calculated based on refrigerants purchased for air conditioners and cooling systems.  
- Scope 3 disclosures in this report include fuel- and energy-related activities, waste generated in operations, employee commuting, and downstream leased assets. Fuel- and energy related well-to-tank transmission and distribution emissions are calculated based on the data provided in Scope 1 and 2. Waste generated in operations includes emissions from third-party disposal and treatment of waste generated (solid waste and wastewater) at controlled operations, assuming zero emissions for recycled waste. Employee commuting includes emissions from the transportation of employees between their homes and their worksites as well as teleworking. The category of downstream leased assets includes emissions from the operation of assets that are owned by the business and are leased to tenants, accounting for tenants' Scope 1 and 2 emissions.  
Energy, GHG, water and waste intensities exclude both newly completed properties in FY2023 and properties divested at any point during the reporting period.

# Corporate Governance Report

# INTRODUCTION

Frasers Centrepoint Trust ("FCT") is a real estate investment trust ("REIT") listed on the Main Board of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (the "SGX-ST"). FCT is managed by Frasers Centrepoint Asset Management Ltd. (the "Manager"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Frasers Property Limited ("FPL" or the "Sponsor" and together with its subsidiaries, "FPL Group").

In line with the listing manual of the SGX-ST (the "SGX-ST Listing Manual") and its obligations under the Guidelines to All Holders of a Capital Markets Services Licence for Real Estate Investment Trust Management (Guideline No: SFA04-G07) issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore ("MAS"), the Manager complies with the principles of the Code of Corporate Governance 2018 (the "CG Code").

The practices and activities of the board of directors of the Manager (the "Board") and the management of the Manager (the "Management") adhere closely to the provisions under the CG Code.

To the extent the practices may vary from any provision of the CG Code, the Manager will state explicitly the provision from which it has varied, explain the reason for the variation and explain how the practices nevertheless are consistent with the intent of the relevant principle of the CG Code. The Manager is also guided by the Practice Guidance which accompanies the CG Code and which sets out best practices for listed issuers, as this will build investor and stakeholder confidence in FCT and the Manager. A summary of compliance with the express disclosure requirements under the provisions of the CG Code is set out on pages 177 to 178 of this Annual Report.

# The Manager

The Manager has general powers of management over the assets of FCT. As a manager of a REIT, the Manager holds a Capital Markets Services Licence issued by the MAS to carry out REIT management activities.

The Manager's main responsibility is to manage FCT's assets and liabilities for the benefit of unitholders of FCT (the "Unitholders"). To this end, the Manager is able to set the strategic direction of FCT and make recommendations to HSBC Institutional Trust Services (Singapore) Limited, in its capacity as trustee of FCT (the "Trustee"), on acquisitions, divestments and enhancement of the assets of FCT. It also supervises the property manager, Frasers Property Retail Management Pte. Ltd. in its day-to-day management of certain properties within FCT's portfolio, namely, Causeway Point, Northpoint City North Wing and Yishun 10 Retail Podium, Changi City Point<sup>1</sup>, Waterway Point (50.00% interest), Tiong Bahru Plaza, White Sands, Hougang Mall, Century Square, Tampines 1 and Central Plaza pursuant to property management agreements entered into for each property. The role of the Manager includes the pursuit of a business model that sustains the growth and enhances the value of FCT and is focused on delivering regular and stable distributions to Unitholders. Other functions and responsibilities of the Manager include preparing annual asset plans and undertaking regular individual asset performance analysis and market research analysis and managing finance functions relating to FCT (which includes financial and tax reporting, capital management, treasury and preparation of consolidated budgets).

# The Values of the Manager

1. The Manager is committed to upholding and maintaining high standards of corporate governance, corporate transparency and sustainability, and instituting sound corporate practices and controls to facilitate the Manager's role in safeguarding and enhancing FCT's asset value so as to maximise returns from investments, and ultimately the total return to Unitholders. The Manager believes that a robust and sound governance framework is an essential foundation on which to build, evolve and innovate a business which is sustainable over the long-term and one which is resilient in the face of the demands of a dynamic, fast-changing environment.  
2. The Manager adheres to corporate policies, business practices and systems of risk management and internal controls, which are designed to ensure that it maintains consistently high standards of integrity, accountability and governance in FCT and its own daily operations.  
3. The Manager ensures that the business and practices of FCT are carried out in a manner that complies with applicable laws, rules and regulations, including the Securities and Futures Act 2001 of Singapore (the "SFA"), the SGX-ST Listing Manual, the CG Code, the Code on Collective Investment Schemes (the "CIS Code") issued by the MAS (including Appendix 6 of the CIS Code, the "Property Funds Appendix"), the trust deed constituting FCT between the Manager and the Trustee dated 5 June 2006 (as amended, restated and supplemented) ("Trust Deed"), as well as the written directions, notices, codes and other guidelines that the MAS and other regulators may issue from time to time.  
As at 30 September 2023, Changi City Point was reclassified to "Assets held for sale", following FCT's announcement relating to the divestment of the property on 30 August 2023. The divestment was completed on 31 October 2023.

# Corporate Governance Report

The Board works with Management to ensure that these values underpin its leadership of the Manager.

The Manager is staffed by an experienced and well-qualified team who manage the operational matters of FCT. The Manager is a wholly-owned subsidiary of FPL, a multi-national developer-owner-operator of real estate products and services across five asset classes, namely, residential, retail, commercial & business parks, industrial & logistics as well as hospitality. The FPL Group has businesses in Southeast Asia, Australia, Europe and China, and its well-established hospitality business owns and/or operates serviced apartments and hotels in over 70 cities and 20 countries across Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

As the Sponsor holds a substantial ownership stake of approximately  $41.35\%^2$  in FCT, there is an alignment of interests between the Sponsor, the Manager and the Unitholders. The Manager is able to benefit from and leverage on its association with the Sponsor in the management of FCT in various ways, including tapping on the Sponsor's extensive experience in development and management of real estate assets, sourcing for talent and experienced personnel within the Sponsor pool of employees, including those who may be considered for appointment to the Board, access to the FPL Group's network of lenders for debt financing, and negotiating for favourable terms with external suppliers and vendors on a group basis.

The Manager is appointed in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed. The Manager can be removed by notice in writing given by the Trustee in favour of a corporation appointed by the Trustee under certain circumstances outlined in the Trust Deed, including where Unitholders, by a resolution duly passed by a simple majority of Unitholders present and voting (with no Unitholder being disenfranchised) at a Unitholders' meeting, decide that the Manager is to be removed.

# BOARD MATTERS

# The Board

The Board is responsible for the overall leadership and oversight of both FCT's and the Manager's business, financial, investment and material operational affairs and performance objectives, and its long-term success. The Board sets the strategic direction of FCT and the Manager, which includes appropriate focus on value creation, innovation and sustainability. The Board also determines the Manager's approach to corporate governance, including setting appropriate tone-from-the-top and the desired organisational culture, values and ethical standards of conduct, and works with Management on its implementation across all levels of the organisation's values, standards, policies and practices. The Board, supported by Management, ensures necessary resources are in place for FCT and the Manager to meet its strategic objectives. Through the enterprise-wide risk management framework of FCT and its subsidiaries (the "Group"), the Board establishes and maintains a sound risk management framework to effectively monitor and manage risks and to achieve an appropriate balance between risks and the Group's performance. The Board also puts in place policies, structures and mechanisms to ensure compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements. The Board, which comprises directors who, as fiduciaries, are expected to act objectively in the best interests of the Manager and the Group, constructively challenges Management and reviews its performance, and holds Management accountable for performance. It also oversees Management to ensure transparency and accountability to key stakeholder groups.

# Corporate Governance Report

# The Chairman

The chairman of the Board (the "Chairman") leads the Board. The Chairman provides leadership and direction in the review of the Manager's corporate strategy and objectives, sets the right ethical and behavioural tone and ensures the Board's effectiveness by, among other things, promoting and maintaining high standards of corporate governance and transparency, encouraging active and effective engagement, participation by all directors of the Manager (the "Directors") and facilitating constructive and appropriate relations among and between them and Management. The Chairman sets the agenda for each Board meeting to take full account of the issues and concerns of the Directors and the Management team, promotes a culture of openness and debate at Board meetings and encourages Directors to engage in productive and thorough discussions and constructive debate on strategic, business and other key issues pertinent to the business and operations of the Group and the Manager, leading to better decision-making and enhanced business performance. The Chairman, supported by Management, ensures effective communication with Unitholders, financial analysts and the media on critical issues that could significantly affect the reputation and standing of the Manager and FCT.

The Chairman also presides over the Annual General Meeting each year and any other general meetings of the Unitholders. The Chairman addresses, and/or requests the Chief Executive Officer (the "CEO") of the Manager to address the Unitholders' queries and ensures that there is clear and open dialogue between all stakeholders.

# Role of the CEO and Management

The Management is led by the CEO. The CEO is responsible for the execution of the strategies and policies as approved by the Board, and leading, promoting and conducting the affairs of FCT and the Manager with the highest standards of integrity, corporate governance and transparency. The CEO is responsible and is accountable to the Board for the conduct and performance of Management. The CEO and Management team of the Manager are responsible for executing the Manager's strategies and policies as approved by the Board and are responsible for the planning, direction, control, conduct and performance of the business operations of the Manager. With the support of the Management, the CEO seeks business opportunities, drives new initiatives and is responsible for the operational performance of the Group and building and maintaining strong relationships with stakeholders of the Group.

# Division of Responsibilities between the Chairman and the CEO

The Chairman and the CEO are separate persons and the division of responsibilities between the Chairman and the CEO is clearly demarcated. This avoids concentration of power and ensures a degree of checks and balances, an increased accountability, and greater capacity of the Board for independent decision-making. Such separation of roles between the Chairman and CEO promotes robust deliberations by the Board and Management on the business activities of FCT.

# Relationships between the CEO and Board

None of the members of the Board and the CEO are related to one another, and none of them has any business relationships among them.

# Board Committees

The Board has formed committees of the Board (the "Board Committees") to oversee specific areas, for greater efficiency and has delegated authority and duties to such Board Committees based on written and clearly defined terms of reference. The terms of reference of the Board Committees set out their compositions, authorities and duties, including reporting back to the Board. There are two Board Committees, namely, the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee ("ARCC"), and the Nominating and Remuneration Committee ("NRC").

Minutes of all Board Committee meetings are circulated to the Board so that Directors are aware of and kept updated as to the proceedings, matters discussed and decisions made during such meetings, and to enable the Directors to weigh in on any key points under consideration.

All members of the ARCC, including the chairperson of the ARCC, are appropriately qualified and have recent and/or relevant accounting and related financial management expertise or experience. Their collective wealth of experience and expertise enables them to discharge their responsibilities competently.

None of the members of the ARCC is a former partner of FCT's external auditors, KPMG LLP and none of the members of the ARCC has any financial interest in FCT's external auditors, KPMG LLP.

# AUDIT FUNCTIONS

The Terms of Reference of the ARCC provide that some of the key responsibilities of the ARCC include:

- External Audit Process: reviewing and reporting to the Board the scope, quality, results and performance of the external audit(s), its cost effectiveness and the independence and objectivity of the external auditors. It shall also review the nature and extent of non-audit services performed by external auditors;  
Internal Audit: establishing an effective internal audit function which shall be adequately qualified to perform an effective role, adequately resourced, independent of the activities which it audits and able to discharge its duties objectively, and to approve the hiring, removal, evaluation and compensation of the head of the internal audit function, or the accounting/auditing firm or corporation to which the internal audit function is outsourced<sup>3</sup>.

# Corporate Governance Report

- Interested Person Transactions: reviewing interested person transactions (as defined in the SGX-ST Listing Manual) and interested party transactions (as defined in the Property Funds Appendix) (both such types of transactions constituting "Related/Interested Person Transactions") entered into from time to time and the internal audit reports to ensure compliance with applicable legislation, the SGX-ST Listing Manual and the Property Funds Appendix;  
Conflicts of Interests: deliberating on resolutions relating to conflicts of interest situations involving FCT;  
Whistle-Blowing: reviewing the policy and arrangements by which staff of the Manager, FCT and any other persons may, in confidence, safely raise concerns about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting or other matters and ensure that arrangements are in place for such concerns to be raised and independently investigated and for appropriate follow-up action to be taken; and  
Investigations: reviewing the findings of internal investigations into any suspected fraud or irregularity, or suspected infringement of any Singapore laws or regulations or rules of the SGX-ST or any other regulatory authority in Singapore, which the ARCC becomes aware of, and which has or is likely to have a material impact on FCT's operating results or financial position.

Where the external auditors, in their review or audit of FCT's year-end financial statements, raise any significant issues which have a material impact on the interim financial statements or business updates previously announced by FCT or the Manager, the ARCC will bring this to the Board's attention immediately so that the Board can consider whether an immediate announcement is required under the SGX-ST Listing Manual. In such a situation, the ARCC will also advise the Board if changes are needed to improve the quality of future interim financial statements or business updates - such changes (if any) will be disclosed in FCT's annual report.

In carrying out its role, the ARCC is empowered to investigate any matter within its Terms of Reference, with full access to, and cooperation by, Management, to seek information it may require from any Director and/or employee of the Manager. The ARCC also has full discretion to invite any Director or executive officer to attend its meetings, and obtain reasonable resources to enable it to discharge its functions properly. The Chairman, non-executive Directors, the CEO, the CFO, the head of the internal audit function, representatives of the external auditor(s), or other person with relevant experience and expertise may attend the meetings of the ARCC at the invitation of the ARCC. The meetings serve as a forum to review and discuss material risks and exposures of the Manager's businesses and strategies to mitigate risks. The ARCC meets with internal auditors and external auditors without the presence of Management at least once a year to review various audit matters and the assistance given by Management to the internal and external auditors. In carrying out its function, the ARCC may also obtain independent or external legal or other professional advice or appoint external consultants as it considers necessary at the Manager's cost.

Periodic updates on changes in accounting standards and treatment are prepared by external auditors and circulated to members of the ARCC so that they are kept abreast of such changes and its corresponding impact on the financial statements, if any.

# Sustainability

The ARCC also assists the Board in carrying out its responsibility in determining environmental, social and governance ("ESG") factors identified as material to the business, monitoring and managing ESG factors and overseeing standards, management processes and strategies to achieve sustainability practices. The ARCC has oversight of sustainability practices, and assists the Board in ensuring that Management establishes and maintains a sound system of sustainability governance and an appropriate sustainability reporting framework which links sustainability risks and opportunities with strategy, other organisational risks and goals and which also enhances operational responses to sustainability risks and opportunities.

# Risk Management

The ARCC shall review the framework and processes established by Management to achieve compliance with applicable laws, regulations, standards, best practice guidelines and the Manager's policies and procedures. The ARCC shall assist the Board in ensuring that Management maintains a sound system of risk management and internal controls to safeguard the interests of the Manager or the interests of Unitholders (as the case may be) and the assets of the Manager and the assets of FCT. The ARCC also assists the Board in its determination of the nature and extent of significant risks which the Board is willing to take in achieving the Manager's strategic objectives and the overall levels of risk tolerance and risk policies, including reviewing technology risks faced by the Manager. Further information on the key activities conducted by the ARCC can be found in the sections titled "Financial Performance, Reporting and Audit" on pages 166 to 167 and "Governance of Risk and Internal Controls" on pages 167 to 170.

# Notes:

(1) Unless otherwise stated, the information provided herein is as at 30 September 2023.  
(2) Dr Cheong Choong Kong retired as a Director, the Chairman of the Board, and a member of the ARCC and NRC on 1 November 2023.  
(3) Mr Ho Kin San was appointed as a non-executive and independent Director and a member of the ARCC and the NRC with effect from 18 July 2023.  
(4) Mr Tan Siew Peng (Darren) was appointed as a non-executive and independent Director and a member of the ARCC and the NRC with effect from 26 September 2023.

As at 30 September 2023, all the members of the NRC are non-executive and the majority of whom, including the chairman of the NRC, are independent.

The NRC is guided by written Terms of Reference approved by the Board which set out the duties and responsibilities of the NRC. The NRC's responsibilities, in relation to its functions as a nominating committee, include reviewing the structure, size and composition and independence of the Board and its Board Committees, reviewing and making recommendations to the Board on the succession plans for Directors, the Chairman and Key Management Personnel, making recommendations to the Board on all appointments and re-appointments of Directors (including alternate Directors, if any), and determining the independence of Directors. The NRC also proposes for the Board's approval, the objective performance criteria and process for the evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board, the Board Committees and each Director, and ensures that proper disclosures of such process are made. The NRC is also responsible for reviewing and making recommendations to the Board on training and professional development programmes for the Board and the Directors.

# Corporate Governance Report

Further information on the main activities of the NRC, in relation to its functions as a nominating committee, are outlined in the following sections:

"Training and Development of Directors" on page 148  
"Board Composition" on pages 149 to 150  
"Directors' Independence" on pages 153 to 158  
"Board Performance Evaluation" on pages 159 to 160

The NRC's responsibilities, in reviewing remuneration matters, include: (i) reviewing and recommending to the Board, a framework of remuneration for the Board and Key Management Personnel, and (ii) ensuring that the remuneration of executive Directors (if any) shall not be linked in any way to FCT's gross revenue.

On an annual basis, the NRC also reviews and recommends, for the Board's approval, the Manager's remuneration and benefits policies and practices (including long-term incentive schemes), and the performance and specific remuneration packages for each Director and Key Management Personnel, in accordance with the approved remuneration policies and processes.

The NRC also proposes, for the Board's approval, criteria to assist in the evaluation of the performance of Key Management Personnel, and (where applicable) reviews the obligations of the Manager arising in the event of the termination of the service agreements of Key Management Personnel to ensure that such contracts of service contain fair and reasonable termination clauses. The NRC also administers and approves awards under the Restricted Unit Plan ("RUP") and/or other long-term incentive schemes to senior employees of the Manager.

In carrying out its review on remuneration matters, the Terms of Reference of the NRC provide that the NRC shall consider all aspects of remuneration, including Directors' fees, special remuneration to Directors who render special or extra services to the Manager, salaries, allowances, bonuses, options, Unit-based incentives and awards, benefits-in-kind and termination payments, and shall aim to be fair and to avoid rewarding poor performance.

If necessary, the NRC can seek expert advice on remuneration within FPL Group's Human Resource Department or from external sources. Where such advice is obtained from external sources, the NRC ensures that existing relationships, if any, between the Manager and the appointed remuneration consultants will not affect the independence and objectivity of the remuneration consultants.

# Delegation of authority framework

As part of the Manager's internal controls, the Board has adopted a framework of delegated authorisations in its Manual of Authorities (the "MOA"). The MOA, which is approved by the Board, sets out the levels of authorisation required for particular types of transactions to be carried out, and specifies whether Board approval needs to be sought. It also sets out approval limits for operating and capital expenditure, treasury transactions as well as investments, divestments and asset enhancement initiatives.

While day-to-day operations of the business are delegated to Management, in order to facilitate the Board's exercise of its leadership and oversight of FCT, the MOA sets out certain matters specifically reserved for approval by the Board and these are clearly communicated to Management in writing. These include approval of annual budgets, financial plans, material transactions, namely, major acquisitions and divestments, funding and investment proposals and asset enhancement initiatives.

# Notes:

A calendar of activities is scheduled for the Board a year in advance.

The Manager's Constitution provides for Board members who are unable to attend physical meetings to participate through telephone conference, video conference or similar communications equipment.

Management provides the Directors with Board papers setting out complete, adequate and relevant information on the agenda items to be discussed at Board and Board Committee meetings around a week in advance of the meeting (save in cases of urgency). This is to give Directors sufficient time to prepare for the meeting and review and consider the matters being tabled so that discussions can be more meaningful and productive and Directors have the necessary information to make sound and informed decisions.

Senior members of the Management attend Board meetings, and where necessary, Board Committee meetings, to brief and make presentations to the Directors, provide input and insight into matters being discussed, and respond to queries and take any follow-up instructions from the Directors. If required, time is set aside after scheduled Board meetings for discussions amongst the Board without the presence of Management.

Where required by the Directors, external advisers may also be present or available whether at Board and Board Committee meetings or otherwise, and (if necessary), at the Manager's expense where applicable, to brief the Directors and provide their advice.

# Board Oversight

Outside of Board and Board Committee meetings, Management provides Directors with complete and adequate reports on major operational matters, business development activities, financial performance, potential investment opportunities and budgets periodically, as well as such other relevant information on an ongoing and timely basis to enable them to discharge their duties and responsibilities properly. In respect of budgets, any material variance between the projections and actual results will be disclosed and explained in the relevant periodic report.

Directors have separate and independent access to Management, and are entitled to request for such additional information as needed to make informed decisions and to fulfil their duties and responsibilities properly, which additional information will then be provided by Management in a timely manner. Where required or requested by Directors, site visits are also arranged for Directors to have an intimate understanding of the key business operations of each division and to promote active engagement with Management.

Directors are provided with complete, adequate and timely information to enable them to ensure that they prepare adequately for Board and Board Committee meetings and make informed decisions, and Directors (including those who hold multiple board representations and other principal commitments) devote sufficient time and attention to the affairs of FCT and the Manager. At Board and Board Committee meetings, the Directors attend and actively participate, discuss, deliberate and appraise matters requiring their attention and decision. Where necessary for the proper discharge of their duties, the Directors may seek and obtain independent professional advice at the Manager's expense.

In addition to the scheduled Board meetings, Management also provides regular updates on the financial performance, investment and asset management and investor relations matters of FCT to the Chairman and ARCC Chairperson during monthly meetings.

# Corporate Governance Report

# The Company Secretary

The Board is supported by the Company Secretary of the Manager (the "Company Secretary"), who is legally trained and familiar with company secretarial practices, and responsible for administering and executing Board and Board Committee procedures in compliance with the Companies Act 1967 of Singapore, the Manager's Constitution, the Trust Deed and applicable law. The Company Secretary also provides advice and guidance on relevant guidelines, notices, rules and regulations, including disclosure requirements under the SFA, applicable MAS guidelines and notices, the CIS Code and the SGX-ST Listing Manual, as well as corporate governance practices and processes.

The Company Secretary attends all Board and Board Committee meetings and drafts and reviews the minutes of proceedings thereof, and facilitates and acts as a channel of communication for the smooth flow of information to and within the Board and its various Board Committees, as well as between and with senior Management. The Directors have separate and independent access to the Company Secretary, whose responsibilities include supporting and advising the Board on corporate and administrative matters.

The Company Secretary solicits and consolidates Directors' feedback and evaluation, facilitates induction and orientation programmes for new Directors, and assists with Directors' professional development matters. The Company Secretary also acts as the Manager's primary channel of communication with the SGX-ST.

The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is subject to the approval of the Board.

# Training and Development of Directors

The NRC is tasked with identifying and developing training programmes for the Board and Board Committees for the Board's approval and ensuring that Directors have the opportunity to develop their skills and knowledge.

Upon appointment, each new Director is issued a formal letter of appointment setting out his or her roles, duties, responsibilities and obligations, including his or her responsibilities as fiduciaries and on the policies relating to conflicts of interest, as well as the expectations of the Manager. An induction and orientation programme is also conducted to provide new appointees with information on the business activities, strategic direction, policies and corporate governance practices of the Manager, as well as their statutory and other duties and responsibilities as Directors. A new Director who has no prior experience as a director of an issuer listed on the SGX-ST must also undergo mandatory training in his or her roles and responsibilities as prescribed by the SGX-ST (including training on sustainability matters), unless the NRC is of the view that training is not required because he or she has other relevant experience, in which case the basis of its assessment will be disclosed.

The Directors are kept continually and regularly updated on FCT's business and the regulatory and industry specific environments in which the entities of the Group operate. The Manager sees to it that the Board is regularly updated on new developments in laws and regulations or changes in regulatory requirements and financial reporting standards which are relevant to or may affect the Manager or FCT and such updates may be in writing, by way of briefings held by the Manager's lawyers, external advisors and external auditors or disseminated by way of presentations and/or handouts. During FY2023, the Directors attended briefings and training programmes on, among others, (i) climate-related financial disclosure; (ii) Workplace Safety and Health legislation and industry update; (iii) updates on MAS Guidelines on Business Continuity Management; and (iv) changes to SGX-ST Listing Manual and recommendations on adoption of the International Sustainability Standards Board reporting standards.

To ensure the Directors have the opportunities to develop their skills and knowledge and to continually improve the performance of the Board, all Directors are encouraged to undergo continual professional development during the term of their appointment, and provided with opportunities to develop and maintain their skills and knowledge at the Manager's expense. The Manager maintains a training record to track Directors' attendance at training and professional development courses.

Directors are encouraged to be members of the Singapore Institute of Directors ("SID") and for them to receive updates and training from SID to stay abreast of relevant developments in financial, legal and regulatory requirements, and relevant business trends.

The NRC reviews, on an annual basis, the structure, size and composition of the Board and Board Committees, taking into account the CG Code and the Securities and Futures (Licensing and Conduct of Business) Regulations ("SFLCB Regulations"). The NRC has assessed that the current structure, size and composition of the Board and Board Committees are appropriate for the scope and nature of FCT's and the Manager's operations. No individual or group dominates the Board's decision-making process or has unfettered powers of decision-making. The NRC is of the opinion that the Directors with their diverse backgrounds and competencies (including real estate experience / knowledge, business management, strategy development, investments / mergers and acquisitions (including fund management and/or investment banking), audit / accounting and finance, risk management, legal / corporate governance, sustainability and human resource management) provide the appropriate balance and mix of skills, knowledge, experience and other aspects of diversity that avoids groupthink and fosters constructive debate and ensures the effectiveness of the Board and its Board Committees. The Board concurs with the views of the NRC.

Where Directors step down from the Board, cessation announcements providing detailed reason(s) for the cessation are released on SGXNet in compliance with the requirements of the SGX-ST Listing Manual.

# Selection, Appointment and Re-appointment of Directors

Under the Terms of Reference of the NRC, the NRC is tasked with making recommendations to the Board on all Board appointments and re-appointments, taking into account, among other things, the scope and nature of the operations of the Group, the requirements of the business, whether Directors who have multiple board representations are able to carry out and have been carrying out their duties as Directors and whether the Directors have given sufficient time and attention to the affairs of FCT and the Manager.

The process for the selection, appointment and re-appointment of Directors also takes into account the composition and progressive renewal of the Board and Board Committees.

Additionally, as part of the NRC's review of the composition, and performance evaluation, of the Board and Board Committees (which are done at least annually), the NRC will consider the competencies, commitment, contribution and performance (e.g. attendance, preparedness, participation and candour) of the Directors (including Directors who are to be recommended for re-appointment). In the case of a potential new Director, the NRC will consider the candidate's experience, education, expertise, judgement, skillset, personal qualities and general and sector specific knowledge in relation to the needs of the Board as well as whether the candidates will add diversity to the Board and whether they are likely to have adequate time to discharge their duties, including attendance at all Board meetings. The NRC will also take into consideration whether a candidate had previously served on the boards of companies with adverse track records or a history of irregularities, and assess whether such past appointments would affect his/ her ability to act as a Director of the Manager.

# Corporate Governance Report

The NRC considers a range of different channels to source and screen both internal and external candidates for Board appointments, depending on the requirements, including tapping on existing networks of contacts and recommendations. External consultants may be retained from time to time, where appropriate, to assist in sourcing, assessing and selecting a broader range of potential internal and external candidates beyond the Board's existing network of contacts. Suitable candidates are carefully evaluated by the NRC so that recommendations made on proposed candidates are objective and well supported.

On an annual basis, the NRC reviews (a) the directorships and principal commitments of each Director, and (b) a framework for Board evaluation to be conducted by an external consultant on the effectiveness of the Board. Through the aforementioned Board evaluation exercise, the Directors assess whether Board members effectively manage his or her directorships and have the time and ability to contribute to the Board.

Instead of prescribing a maximum number of directorships and/or other principal commitments that each Director may have, the NRC adopts a holistic assessment of each Director's individual capacity and circumstances to carry out his or her duties, taking into consideration not only the number of other board and other principal commitments held by each Director, but also the nature and complexity of such commitments. The assessment also takes into consideration Directors' commitment, conduct and contributions (such as meaningful participation, candour and rigorous decision making) at Board meetings, as well as whether the Director's engagement with Management is adequate and effective. In respect of FY2023, the NRC is of the view that each Director, including Directors who hold multiple board representations, has been able to diligently discharge his or her duties as a Director of the Manager.

Further details on the Board evaluation exercise are set out under the section "Board Performance Evaluation" on pages 159 to 160.

Directors are not subject to periodic retirement by rotation. Under its Terms of Reference, the NRC is tasked with reviewing the succession plans for Directors, the Chairman and Key Management Personnel.

# Board Diversity Policy, Targets, Timelines and Progress

The NRC is responsible for:

(a) the Board Diversity Policy which has been adopted by the Board;  
(b) setting qualitative and measurable quantitative objectives (where appropriate) for achieving board diversity;  
(c) monitoring and implementing the Board Diversity Policy, and taking the principles of the Board Diversity Policy into consideration when determining the optimal composition of the Board and recommending any proposed changes to the Board; and  
(d) reviewing the Manager's progress towards achieving the objectives under the Board Diversity Policy.

Upon the NRC's recommendation, the Board will set certain measurable objectives and specific diversity targets (each a "Target") in order to achieve an optimal Board composition. These Targets will be reviewed by the NRC annually to ensure their appropriateness. The NRC will endeavour to ensure that the Targets are taken into consideration when assessing the suitability of candidates for new Board appointments, and together with the Board, will work towards meeting the Targets as set by the Board. The Board will strive to ensure, with a view to meeting the Targets, that:

(a) any brief to external search consultants for potential appointments to the Board will include a requirement to fulfil one or more Targets; and  
(b) candidates fulfilling one or more of the Target(s) are included for consideration by the NRC whenever it seeks to identify a new Director for appointment to the Board.

The Manager embraces diversity and the Board Diversity Policy addresses various aspects of diversity such as gender, skills and expertise and age.

# Corporate Governance Report

The Board composition reflects the Manager's commitment to Board diversity, especially in terms of gender, skills and expertise and age. The Manager's diversity Targets for the Board, its plans and timelines for achieving the Targets, and its progress towards achieving the Targets, are described below.

# Target

# Progress and plans towards achieving Target

# 1. Gender representation

Maintain at least  $25\%$  female representation on the Board.

# 2. Skills and Expertise

The Board to comprise Directors who, as a group, possess a variety of qualifications and competencies, including skillsets, expertise and/or experience in at least a majority of the identified core competencies of:

(i) real estate industry experience/knowledge;  
(ii) business management;  
(iii) strategy development;  
(iv) investments/mergers and acquisitions (including fund management and/or investment banking);  
(v) audit/accounting and finance;  
(vi) risk management;  
(vii) legal/corporate governance;  
(viii) digital and technology (including AI);  
(ix) sustainability; and  
(x) human resource management.

As at 30 September 2023, female representation on the Board is  $25\%$  and therefore this target is met.

As at 30 September 2023, this target is met.

In FY2023, the following directors were appointed to the Board:

(i) Mr Ho Kin San was appointed as a non-executive and independent director on 18 July 2023. He is currently a partner and Co-Head of the Corporate Real Estate Department of Allen & Gledhill LLP, and has over 30 years of experience in corporate real estate work. Mr Ho's experience as a corporate real estate lawyer will provide further diversity to the core competencies and skill set of the Board.  
(ii) Mr Tan Siew Peng (Darren) was appointed as a non-executive and independent director on 26 September 2023. He is currently the Chief Investment Officer of Raffles Medical Group Ltd wherein he develops and executes business and investment strategies, and has over 28 years of experience in financial matters (including in the areas of accounting, treasury and capital and asset liability management). Mr Tan's experience in the development and execution of investment strategies as well as in the aforesaid financial matters will provide further diversity to the core competencies and skill set of the Board.

When considering new Directors for appointment to the Board, candidates who have relevant skills, expertise and/or experience which would complement those already on the Board would be prioritised.

# 3. Age diversity

The Board to comprise directors falling within at least two out of three age groups, being (i) 50 and below; (ii) 51 to 60; and (iii) 61 and above.

As at 30 September 2023, this target is met.

# Corporate Governance Report

The Manager's target is to maintain the above levels of diversity in gender representation, skills and expertise, and age annually.

The Board views Board diversity as an essential element for driving value in decision-making and proactively seeks as part of its Board Diversity Policy, to maintain an appropriate balance of expertise, skills and attributes among the Directors. This is reflected in the diversity of gender, skills and expertise and age of the Directors. The Board, taking into account the views of the NRC, considers that diversity of the Board will contribute to the quality of its decision-making process and serve the needs and plans of the Group. In this regard:

(a) in relation to gender representation, the Manager believes in achieving an optimum mix of gender representation on the Board to provide different approaches and perspectives. The push for greater gender diversity would also provide the Manager with access to a broader talent pool and improve its capacity for strategic thinking and problem solving;  
(b) in relation to skills and expertise, the Manager believes that diversity in skills and expertise would support the work of the Board and Board Committees and the needs of the Manager. This benefits the Manager and Management as decisions by, and discussions with, the Board would be enriched by the broad range of views and perspectives and the breadth of experience of the Directors. In addition, this would facilitate the effective oversight of management and the Group's businesses and would also help shape the Manager's strategic objectives; and  
(c) in relation to age diversity, the Manager believes that age diversity would contribute beneficially to the Board's deliberations and avoid the risk of groupthink, while ensuring the Board's decisions and/or strategies stay relevant as markets evolve.

The current Board composition reflects an appropriate diversity of age, independence, backgrounds and competencies of the Directors. The competencies of the Directors range from real estate industry experience/knowledge, business management, strategy development, investments/mergers and acquisitions (including fund management and/or investment banking), audit/accounting and finance, risk management, legal/corporate governance and human resource management. As at 30 September 2023, the ages of the Board members range from 52 to 82 years.

# Directors' Independence

The Directors exercise their judgement independently and objectively in the interests of FCT and the Manager. The NRC determines annually, and as and when circumstances require, if a Director is independent based on the rules, guidelines and/or circumstances on director independence as set out in Rule 210(5)(d) of the SGX-ST Listing Manual, Provision 2.1 of the CG Code and the accompanying Practice Guidance, the MAS Guidelines No. SFA04-G07 "Guidelines to all Holders of a Capital Markets Services Licence for Real Estate Investment Trust Management" dated 1 January 2016 and Regulations 13D to 13H of the SFLCB Regulations (collectively, the "Relevant Regulations"). The NRC provides its views to the Board for the Board's consideration. Directors are expected to disclose any relationships with the Manager, its related corporations, its substantial shareholders, its officers or the substantial Unitholders of FCT, if any, which may affect their independence, as and when they arise, to the Board.

Each of the Independent Directors complete a declaration of independence annually which is then reviewed by the NRC. Based on the declarations of independence of these Directors, and having regard to the rules, guidelines and circumstances set forth in the Relevant Regulations, the NRC and the Board have determined that for FY2023, there are five independent Directors on the Board, namely Dr Cheong Choong Kong, Mr Ho Chai Seng, Mr Ho Kin San, Ms Koh Choon Fah and Mr Tan Siew Peng (Darren).

(3) Ms Koh Choon Fah is a director and a shareholder of New Horizon Holdings Pte Ltd ("New Horizon"), holding a  $20\%$  shareholding interest in New Horizon. New Horizon holds  $28.68\%$  of Edmund Tie Holdings Pte. Ltd., which in turn holds  $100\%$  of Edmund Tie & Company (SEA) Pte. Ltd. ("ETCSEA"). Ms Koh thereby has an approximately  $5.736\%$  effective shareholding interest in ETCSEA. Ms Koh was the executive director and chief executive officer of ETCSEA (the "ETCSEA Appointments") until 31 March 2021 and 30 June 2021 respectively.

ETCSEA has been appointed by related corporations of the Manager, being other entities within the FPL Group in FY2023 and the immediately preceding financial year, to provide real estate related services, and received fees therefor (the "ETCSEA Fees"). These services fall within the categories of business relationships set out in Regulation 13G of the SFLCB Regulations. Pursuant to the SFLCB Regulations, during FY2023, Ms Koh Choon Fah is deemed to have a business relationship with the Manager and FCT.

Nonetheless, taking into consideration that (i) the fees paid previously to ETCSEA have been made on an arm's length basis following assessment and determination carried out independently by the management teams of the relevant FPL Group entities based on objective criteria, including competence, service level and/or competitiveness of pricing and (ii) the declaration of independence by Ms Koh Choon Fah, the Board of the Manager is satisfied that the appointment of ETCSEA by entities of the FPL Group and the payment of ETCSEA Fees in respect therefor do not affect her continued ability to exercise strong objective judgement and be independent in conduct and character (in particular, in the expression of her views and in her participation in the deliberations and decision-making of the Board and Board Committees of which she is a member), acting in the best interests of all Unitholders as a whole.

As a measure by the Manager to mitigate potential conflicts of interest, FCT will not consider ETCSEA for the provision of valuation services for any acquisition or disposal of retail assets by FCT or for any existing assets of FCT. For all other services, if ETCSEA is assessed and determined to be the most suitable based on objective criteria, including competence, service level and/or competitiveness of pricing, and FCT is considering engaging ETCSEA, Ms Koh Choon Fah will abstain from voting on any proposal for such engagement. Further, following the cessation of the ETCSEA Appointments, even though Ms Koh continues to have an approximately  $5.736\%$  effective shareholding interest in ETCSEA, she is no longer involved in the running of the business of, or the provision of services by, ETCSEA.

These leasing arrangements fall within the categories of business relationships set out in Regulation 13G of the SFLCB Regulations. Pursuant to the SFLCB Regulations, during FY2023, Mr Tan Siew Peng (Darren) is deemed to have a business relationship with the Manager and FCT.

Nonetheless, taking into consideration that (i) the RMG Leases are made on an arm's-length basis following assessment and determination carried out independently by the relevant property manager and the asset management teams of the Manager and/or the relevant FPL Group entities based on objective criteria, including tenant trade mix, rental rates and/or lease tenure, (ii) Mr Tan Siew Peng (Darren) has confirmed that his role as the Chief Investment Officer of RMG does not require him to be involved in matters relating to RMG's leasing of premises, in any RMG Leases and (iii) the declaration of independence by Mr Tan Siew Peng (Darren), the Board of the Manager is satisfied that the RMG Leases and the RMG Payments do not affect his continued ability to exercise strong objective judgement and be independent in conduct and character (in particular, in the expression of his views and in his participation in the deliberations and decision-making of the Board and Board Committees of which he is a member), acting in the best interests of all Unitholders as a whole.

The independent Directors lead the way in upholding good corporate governance at the Board level and their presence facilitates the exercise of objective independent judgement on corporate affairs. Their participation and input also ensure that key issues and strategies are critically reviewed, constructively challenged, fully discussed and thoroughly examined, taking into account the long-term interests of FCT and its Unitholders. As of 30 September 2023, none of the independent Directors have served on the Board for a continuous period of nine years or longer. Board renewal is a continuing process where the appropriate composition of the Board is continually under review. In this regard, the tenure of each independent Director is monitored so that the process for board renewal is commenced ahead of any independent Director reaching the nine-year mark to facilitate a smooth transition and to ensure that the Board continues to have an appropriate balance of independence. To this end, the NRC is tasked with undertaking the process of reviewing, considering and recommending any changes to the composition of the Board, where appropriate, taking into account the requirements to be met by independent Directors including the SFLCB Regulations.

As the majority of the Board comprises independent Directors, the Manager will not be subjecting any appointment or re-appointment of Directors to voting by Unitholders under Regulation 13D of the SFLCB Regulations. The Chairman is presently an independent Director.

# Corporate Governance Report

# Changes to the Board and Board Committees after 30 September 2023

In line with the Company's plans for Board refreshment and renewal, the following changes to the Board and Board Committees took place, or will take place, after 30 September 2023:

(a) Dr Cheong Choong Kong retired as a Director, the Chairman of the Board, and a member of the ARCC and the NRC with effect from 1 November 2023;

(c) Mr Low Chee Wah will retire as a Director with effect from 1 January 2024; and  
(d) Mr Tan Siew Peng (Darren) was appointed as the Chairman of the ARCC with effect from 1 November 2023.

# Conflict of Interest

The Board has in place clear procedures for dealing with conflicts of interest. To address and manage possible conflicts of interest (including in relation to Directors, officers and employees) that may arise in managing FCT, the Manager has put in place procedures which, among other things, specify that: (a) the Manager shall be dedicated to the management of FCT and will not directly or indirectly manage other REITs; (b) all executive officers of the Manager will be employed by the Manager; (c) all resolutions in writing of the Directors in relation to matters concerning FCT must be approved by a majority of the Directors, including at least one independent Director; (d) at least one-third of the Board shall comprise independent Directors; (e) on matters where FPL and/or its subsidiaries have an interest (directly or indirectly), Directors nominated by FPL and/or its subsidiaries shall abstain from voting. On such matters, the quorum must comprise a majority of independent Directors and must exclude nominee Directors of FPL and/ or its subsidiaries; and (f) an interested Director is required to disclose his/her interest in any proposed transaction with FCT, to recuse himself or herself from meetings and/or discussions (or relevant segments thereof), and is required to abstain from voting on resolutions approving the transaction.

The Manager does not have a practice of extending loans to Directors, and as at 30 September 2023, there were no loans granted by the Manager to Directors. If there are such loans, the Manager will comply with its obligations under the Companies Act 1967 of Singapore in relation to loans, quasi-loans, credit transactions and related arrangements to Directors.

# Board Performance Evaluation

The NRC is tasked with making recommendations to the Board on the process and objective performance criteria for evaluation of the performance of the Board as a whole, the Board Committees and the individual Directors.

The Board, with the recommendation of the NRC, has approved the objective performance criteria and implemented a formal process for assessing the effectiveness of the Board as a whole and its Board Committees separately, and the contribution by the Chairman and each individual Director to the effectiveness of the Board, on an annual basis. The objective performance criteria are not typically changed from year to year.

In relation to the financial year ended 30 September 2022 ("FY2022"), the outcome of the evaluation was generally affirmative across the evaluation categories. Based on the NRC's review, the Board and the various Board Committees operate effectively and each Director is contributing to the overall effectiveness of the Board.

For FY2023, an independent external consultant, Aon Solutions Singapore Pte. Ltd., has been appointed to facilitate the process of conducting a Board evaluation survey. The external consultant has no connection with the Manager or FCT or any of the Directors.

Each Director is required to complete a Board evaluation questionnaire, a Board Committee evaluation questionnaire and an individual Director self-evaluation questionnaire (the "Questionnaires"). The Questionnaires have been designed to provide an evaluation of the current effectiveness of the Board and to support the Chairman and the Board in proactively considering what can enhance the readiness of the Board to address emerging strategic priorities for FCT as a whole. The external consultant will facilitate the sending of questionnaires to all Directors, and one-to-one interviews are conducted selectively on a rotational basis, to obtain Directors' feedback.

# Corporate Governance Report

The objective performance criteria covered in the Board evaluation exercise relate to the following key segments: (1) Board composition (balance of skills, experience, independence, knowledge of the company, and diversity); (2) management of information flow; (3) Board processes (including Board practices and conduct); (4) Board's consideration of ESG aspects; (5) Board strategy and priorities; (6) Board's value-add to, and management of the performance of the Manager and FCT; (7) development and succession planning of executives; (8) development and training of Directors; (9) oversight of risk management and internal controls; and (10) the effectiveness of the Board Committees. The individual Director self-evaluation questionnaire aims to assess whether each Director is willing and able to constructively challenge and contribute effectively to the Board, and demonstrate commitment to his or her roles on the Board and Board Committees (if any).

The responses to the Questionnaires and interview(s), if any for that particular financial year, are summarised by the external consultant and its report submitted to the NRC. To provide a greater level of objectivity in the evaluation process, the report also includes peer comparisons and third-party benchmarking of the results to the evaluation. Findings and recommendations of the external consultant which include feedback from Directors would be taken into consideration and any necessary follow-up actions would be undertaken with a view to improving the overall effectiveness of the Board in fulfilling its role and meeting its responsibilities to Unitholders. The Chairman will, where necessary, provide feedback to the Directors with a view to improving Board performance and, where appropriate, propose changes to the composition of the Board.

# REMUNERATION MATTERS

The remuneration of the staff of the Manager and Directors' fees are paid by the Manager from the management fees it receives from FCT, and not by FCT. With the recommendations of the NRC, the Board has put in place a formal and transparent procedure for developing policies on remuneration of Directors and Key Management Personnel and for reviewing and approving the remuneration packages of individual Directors and Key Management Personnel.

# Compensation Philosophy

The Manager seeks to incentivise and reward consistent and sustained performance through market competitive, internally equitable and performance-oriented compensation programmes which are aligned with Unitholders' interests. This compensation philosophy is the foundation of the Manager's remuneration framework and seeks to (a) align the aspirations and interests of its employees with the interests of FCT and its Unitholders, resulting in the sharing of rewards for both employees and Unitholders on a sustained basis and (b) attract, retain and motivate employees. The Manager aims to connect employees' desire to develop and fulfil their aspirations with the growth opportunities afforded by the Manager's strategic vision and corporate initiatives.

# Compensation Principles

All compensation programme design, determination and administration are guided by the following principles:

# (a) Pay-for-Performance

The Manager's Pay-for-Performance principle encourages excellence, in a manner consistent with the Manager's core values. The Manager takes a total compensation approach, which recognises the value and responsibility of each role, and differentiates and rewards performance through its incentive plans.

# (b) Unitholder Returns

Performance measures for incentives are established to drive initiatives and activities that are aligned with both short-term value creation and long-term Unitholder wealth creation, thus ensuring a focus on delivering Unitholder returns.

# (c) Sustainable Performance

The Manager believes sustained success depends on the balanced pursuit and consistent achievement of short-term and long-term goals. Hence, variable incentives incorporate a significant pay-at-risk element to align employees with sustainable performance for the Manager.

# Corporate Governance Report

# (d) Market Competitiveness

The Manager aims to be market competitive by benchmarking its compensation levels with relevant comparators accordingly. However, the Manager embraces a holistic view of employee engagement that extends beyond monetary rewards. Recognising each individual as unique, the Manager seeks to motivate and develop employees through all the levers available to the Manager through its comprehensive human capital platform, including:

(a) culture and engagement building;  
(b) a holistic benefits and wellbeing framework;  
(c) leadership development;  
(d) learning and development; and  
(e) career advancement through vertical, lateral and diagonal moves within the Group.

# Engagement of External Consultants

The NRC may from time to time, and where necessary or required, engage external consultants in framing the remuneration policy and determining the level and mix of remuneration for Directors and Management. Among other things, this helps the Manager to stay competitive in its remuneration packages. During FY2023, Willis Towers Watson Consulting (Singapore) Pte Ltd and Mercer (Singapore) Ptd Ltd were appointed as the Manager's remuneration consultants. The remuneration consultants do not have any relationship with FCT, the Manager, its controlling shareholders, its related entities and/or its Directors which would affect their independence and objectivity.

# Remuneration Framework

The NRC reviews and makes recommendations to the Board on the remuneration framework for the independent Directors and other non-executive Directors and the Key Management Personnel. The remuneration framework is endorsed by the Board.

The remuneration framework:

(a) covers all aspects of remuneration including salaries, allowances, performance bonuses, benefits-in-kind, termination terms and payments, grant of awards of units of FCT ("Units") and incentives for the Key Management Personnel and fees for the independent Directors and other non-executive Directors. The NRC considers all such aspects of remuneration to ensure they are fair and avoid rewarding poor performance; and  
(b) is tailored to the specific role and circumstances of each Director and Key Management Personnel, to ensure an appropriate remuneration level and mix that recognises the performance, potential and responsibilities of these individuals, as applicable.

# Remuneration Policy in respect of Management and other employees

The NRC takes into account all aspects of remuneration, including termination terms, to ensure that they are fair. The NRC reviews the level, structure and mix of remuneration and benefits policies and practices (where appropriate) of the Manager and takes into account the strategic objectives of FCT and the Manager to ensure that they are:

(a) appropriate and proportionate to the sustained performance and value creation of FCT and the Manager; and  
(b) designed to attract, retain and motivate the Key Management Personnel to successfully manage FCT and the Manager for the long term.

The remuneration framework comprises fixed and variable components, which include short-term and long-term incentives. When conducting its review of the remuneration, the NRC takes into account the performance of FCT and individual performance. The performance of FCT is measured based on pre-set financial and non-financial indicators. Individual performance is measured via the employee's annual performance review based on indicators such as core values, competencies and key performance indicators.

# Corporate Governance Report

# Fixed Component

The fixed component in the Manager's remuneration framework is structured to remunerate employees for the roles they perform, and is benchmarked against relevant industry market data. It comprises base salary, fixed allowances and applicable statutory contribution. The base salary and fixed allowances for Key Management Personnel are reviewed annually by the NRC and approved by the Board.

Variable Component

A significant and appropriate proportion of the remuneration of key executives of the Manager comprises a variable component which is structured to link rewards to corporate and individual performance and incentivise sustained performance in both the short and long term. The variable incentives are based on quantitative and qualitative targets, and overall performance will be determined at the end of the year and approved by the NRC. The performance targets are measurable, appropriate and meaningful so that they incentivise the right behaviour in a manner consistent with the Group's core values. For individuals in control functions, performance targets are principally based on the achievement of the objectives of their functions.

# 1. Short-Term Incentive Plans

The short-term incentive plans ("STI Plans") aim to incentivise short term performance excellence. All Key Management Personnel's performance are assessed through either a balanced scorecard or annual performance review with pre-agreed key performance indicators ("KPIs"). The KPIs consist of:

(a) financial KPIs based on the performance of FCT;  
(b) non-financial KPIs which may include measures on People & Culture, Business Growth, Digitalisation, Data & Innovation and Sustainability or specified projects. The sustainability performance indicator includes areas such as asset and entity level ESG benchmarking, green finance and skills and leadership.

At the end of the financial year, the achievements are measured against the pre-agreed targets and the short-term incentives of each Key Management Personnel are determined.

The NRC recommends the final short-term incentives that are awarded to Key Management Personnel for the Board's approval, taking into consideration any other relevant circumstances.

# 2. Long-Term Incentive Plans

The NRC administers the Manager's long-term incentive plan, namely, the RUP. The RUP was approved by the Board and subsequently adopted by Unitholders on 8 December 2017. Through the RUP, the Manager seeks to foster a greater ownership culture within the Manager by aligning more directly the interests of senior employees (including the CEO) with the interests of Unitholders and other stakeholders, and for such employees to participate and share in FCT's growth and success, thereby ensuring alignment with sustainable value creation for Unitholders over the long term.

The RUP is available to selected senior employees of the Manager. Its objectives are to increase the Manager's flexibility and effectiveness in attracting, motivating and retaining talented senior employees and in rewarding these employees for the future performance of FCT and the Manager.

Under the RUP, the Manager grants Unit-based awards ("Initial Awards") with pre-determined performance targets being set at the beginning of the performance period. The NRC recommends the Initial Awards granted to Key Management Personnel to the Board for approval, taking into consideration the Key Management Personnel's individual performance. The performance period for the RUP is one year. The pre-set targets are net property income and distribution per Unit. Such performance conditions are generally performance indicators that are key drivers of business performance, Unitholder value creation and aligned to FCT's business objectives.

The RUP awards represent the right to receive fully paid Units, their equivalent cash value or a combination thereof, free of charge, provided certain prescribed performance conditions are met. The final number of Units to be released ("Final Awards") will depend on the achievement of the pre-determined targets at the end of the performance period. If such targets are exceeded, more Units than the Initial Awards may be delivered, subject to a maximum multiplier of the Initial Awards. The Final Awards will vest to the participants in three tranches, after the one-year performance period, at or around the 1st, 2nd and 3rd anniversary of the grant date of the Initial Awards. The obligation to deliver the Units is expected to be satisfied out of the Units held by the Manager.

# Corporate Governance Report

The NRC has discretion to decide on the Final Awards, taking into consideration any other relevant circumstances.

Approach to Remuneration of Key Management Personnel

The Manager advocates a performance-based remuneration system that is highly flexible and responsive to the market, and that is structured so as to link a significant and appropriate proportion of remuneration to FCT's performance and that of the individual.

In designing the compensation structure, the NRC seeks to ensure that the level and mix of remuneration is competitive, relevant and appropriate in finding a balance between current versus long-term compensation and between cash versus equity incentive compensation.

Executives who have a greater ability to influence outcomes within the Manager have a greater proportion of overall reward at risk. The NRC exercises broad discretion and independent judgement in ensuring that the amount and mix of compensation are aligned with interests of Unitholders and other stakeholders and promote the long-term success of FCT, and appropriate to attract, retain and motivate Key Management Personnel to successfully manage FCT for the long term.

Performance Indicators for Key Management Personnel

As set out above, the Manager's variable remuneration comprises short-term and long-term incentives, taking into account both FCT's and individual performance. This is to ensure employee remuneration is linked to performance. In determining the short-term incentives, both FCT's financial and non-financial performance as per the balanced scorecard are taken into consideration. The performance targets align the interests of the Key Management Personnel with the long-term growth and performance of FCT and the Manager. The financial performance indicators on which the Key Management Personnel are evaluated comprise (a) FCT's net property income, (b) distribution per Unit, (c) FCT's price-to-book value (against a peer group), (d) Manager's profit before interest and tax, and (e) divestment of non-core assets. These performance indicators are quantitative and are objective measures of FCT's performance. The non-financial performance indicators on which the Key Management Personnel are evaluated include (i) Culture & People, (ii) Business Growth, (iii) Digitalisation, Data & Innovation and (iv) Sustainability. The sustainability performance indicator includes areas such as asset and entity level ESG benchmarking, green finance and skills and leadership. These qualitative performance indicators will align the Key Management Personnel's performance with FCT's strategic objectives.

In relation to long-term incentives, the Manager has implemented the RUP with effect from the financial year ended 30 September 2018 as set out above. The release of long-term incentive awards to Key Management Personnel are conditional upon the performance targets being met. The performance targets of the KPIs align the interests of the Key Management Personnel with the long-term growth and performance of FCT. In FY2023, the pre-determined target performance levels for the RUP grant were met.

Currently, the Manager does not have claw-back provisions which allow it to reclaim incentive components of remuneration from its Key Management Personnel in exceptional circumstances of misstatement of financial results or misconduct resulting in financial loss. The Manager is reviewing the terms of the incentive plans, which includes a review of any claw-back provisions.

Remuneration Packages of Key Management Personnel

The NRC reviews and makes recommendations on the specific remuneration packages and service terms for the Key Management Personnel for endorsement by the Board, which is ultimately accountable for all remuneration decisions relating to the Key Management Personnel. The NRC will review the short-term and long-term incentives in the Key Management Personnel's remuneration package to ensure its compliance with the substance and spirit of the directions and guidelines from the MAS.

No Director or Key Management Personnel is involved in deciding his or her remuneration.

The NRC aligns the CEO's leadership, through appropriate remuneration and benefit policies, with FCT's and the Manager's strategic objectives and key challenges. Performance targets are also set for the CEO and his performance is evaluated yearly.

# Corporate Governance Report

# Remuneration Policy in respect of Non-Executive Directors

The remuneration of non-executive Directors has been designed to be appropriate to the level of contribution, taking into account factors such as effort, time spent, and responsibilities, on the Board and Board Committees, and to attract, retain and motivate the Directors to provide good stewardship of FCT to successfully manage FCT for the long term.

Non-executive Directors do not receive bonuses, options or Unit-based incentives and awards. Directors' fees are paid in cash and not in the form of Units.

The Manager engages consultants to review Directors' fees by benchmarking such fees against the amounts paid by listed industry peers. Each non-executive Director's remuneration comprises a basic fee and attendance fees for attending Board and Board Committee meetings. In addition, non-executive Directors who perform additional services in Board Committees are paid an additional fee for such services. The chairman or chairperson of each Board Committee is also paid a higher fee compared with the members of the respective Board Committees in view of the greater responsibility carried by that office.

The Manager's Board fee structure during FY2023 is set out below.

There are no existing or proposed service agreements entered into or to be entered into by the Manager or any of its subsidiaries with Directors or Key Management Personnel which provide for compensation in the form of stock options, or pension, retirement or other similar benefits, or other benefits, upon termination of employment.

Pursuant to the MAS Notice to All Holders of a Capital Markets Services Licence for Real Estate Investment Trust Management (Notice No: SFA4-N14), REIT managers are required to disclose the remuneration of the CEO and each individual Director on a named basis, and the remuneration of at least the top five executive officers (which shall not include the CEO and executive officers who are Directors), on a named basis, in bands of $250,000. The REIT manager may provide an explanation if it does not wish to or is unable to comply with such requirement. The Manager is (a) disclosing the CEO's remuneration in bands of $250,000 (instead of on a quantum basis), (b) not disclosing exact details of the remuneration of the other Key Executives of the Manager in bands of $250,000 and (c) disclosing the aggregate remuneration of all key executives of the Manager (excluding the CEO), for the following reasons:

(i) given the competitive business environment which FCT operates in, the Manager faces significant competition for talent in the REIT management sector and the Manager has not disclosed the exact remuneration of the Key Executives (including the CEO) so as to minimise potential staff movement and undue disruption to its management team which would be prejudicial to the interests of Unitholders;  
(ii) the composition of the current management team has been stable and to ensure the continuity of business and operations of FCT, it is important that the Manager continues to retain its team of competent and committed staff;  
(iii) it is important for the Manager to ensure stability and continuity of its business by retaining a competent and experienced management team and being able to attract talented staff and disclosure of the remuneration of the CEO and the other Key Executives could make it difficult to retain and attract talented staff on a long-term basis;  
(iv) due to the confidentiality and sensitivity of staff remuneration matters, the Manager is of the view that such disclosure could be prejudicial to the interests of Unitholders; and  
(v) the remuneration of the CEO and the other Key Executives of the Manager are paid by the Manager and there is full disclosure of the total amount of fees paid to the Manager as set out at pages 187, 231 and 259 to 260 of this Annual Report.

# Corporate Governance Report

While the disclosure of the exact quantum of the remuneration of the CEO and the requisite remuneration band for each of the other Key Executives (who are not also Directors or the CEO) would be in full compliance with Provision 8.1 of the CG Code, taking into account the reasons why such disclosure would be prejudicial to the interests of Unitholders and that the Manager has disclosed the remuneration policies, composition of remuneration, appraisal process and performance metrics which go towards determination of the performance bonus of the CEO and other key executives, the Board has determined that despite the partial deviation from Provision 8.1 of the CG Code, there is sufficient transparency on the Manager's remuneration policies, level and mix of remuneration, the procedure for setting remuneration and the relationships between remuneration, performance and value creation which are consistent with the intent of Principle 8 of the CG Code.

As at 30 September 2023, there are no employees within the Manager who is a substantial Unitholder or who is an immediate family member of a Director, the CEO or a substantial Unitholder.

# FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, REPORTING AND AUDIT

The Board, with the support of Management, is responsible for providing a balanced and understandable assessment of FCT's performance, position and prospects. Financial reports are provided to the Board on a quarterly basis and monthly accounts are made available to the Directors on request.

The Manager prepares the financial statements of FCT in accordance with the recommendations of the Statement of Recommended Accounting Practice 7 "Reporting Framework for Investment Funds" issued by the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants, the applicable requirements of the CIS Code issued by the MAS, SGX-ST Listing Manual, Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International), and the provisions of the Trust Deed.

The Board releases FCT's half-yearly and full year financial results. The Manager also provides business updates to Unitholders for the first and third quarter performance of FCT. The Board also provides Unitholders with relevant business updates, other price or trade sensitive information and material corporate developments through announcements to the SGX-ST and FCT's website.

# External Audit

The ARCC conducts an assessment of the external auditors, and recommends its appointment, re-appointment or removal to the Board. The assessment is based on factors such as the performance and quality of its audit, the cost effectiveness and the independence and objectivity of the external auditors. The ARCC also makes recommendations to the Board on the remuneration and terms of engagement of the external auditors.

At the annual general meeting ("AGM") held on 17 January 2023, KPMG LLP was re-appointed by Unitholders as the external auditors of FCT until the conclusion of the next AGM. Pursuant to the requirements of the SGX-ST, an audit partner may only be in charge of a maximum of five consecutive annual audits and may then return after two years. The KPMG LLP audit partner in charge of the annual audit for the Group for FY2023 is in charge of the annual audit for the third time.

During FY2023, the ARCC conducted a review of the scope, quality, results and performance of audit by the external auditors and its cost effectiveness, as well as the independence and objectivity of the external auditors. It also reviewed all non-audit services provided by the external auditors during the financial year, and the aggregate amount of fees paid to them for such services. Details of fees paid or payable to the external auditors in respect of audit and non-audit services for FY2023 are set out in the table below:

<table><tr><td>Fees relating to external auditors for FY2023</td><td>$&#x27;000</td></tr><tr><td>For audit and audit-related services</td><td>311.7</td></tr><tr><td>For non-audit services</td><td>147.8</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>459.5</td></tr></table>

# Corporate Governance Report

The ARCC has conducted a review of all non-audit services provided by KPMG LLP during the financial year. The ARCC is satisfied that given the nature and extent of non-audit services provided and the fees for such services, neither the independence nor the objectivity of KPMG LLP is put at risk. KPMG LLP attended the ARCC meetings held every quarter for FY2023, and where appropriate, has met with the ARCC without the presence of Management to discuss their findings, if any.

The Manager, on behalf of FCT, confirms that FCT has complied with Rule 712 of the SGX-ST Listing Manual which requires, amongst others, that a suitable auditing firm should be appointed by FCT having regard to certain factors. FCT has also complied with Rule 715 of the SGX-ST Listing Manual which requires that the same auditing firm of FCT based in Singapore audits its Singapore-incorporated subsidiaries and significant associated companies, and that a suitable auditing firm be engaged for its significant foreign-incorporated subsidiaries and associated companies.

In the review of the financial statements for FY2023, the ARCC discussed the following key audit matters identified by the external auditors with Management:

<table><tr><td>Key Audit Matters</td><td>How this issue was addressed by the ARCC</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">Valuation of investment properties</td><td>The ARCC considered the methodologies and key assumptions applied by the valuers in arriving at the valuation of the properties.</td></tr><tr><td>The ARCC reviewed the outputs from the financial year-end valuation process of the Group&#x27;s investment properties and discussed the details of the valuation with Management, focusing on significant changes in fair value measurements and key drivers of the changes.</td></tr><tr><td>The ARCC was satisfied with the valuation process, the methodologies used and the valuation for investment properties as adopted as at 30 September 2023.</td></tr></table>

# GOVERNANCE OF RISK AND INTERNAL CONTROLS

The Board is responsible for the governance of risk and ensures that Management maintains a sound system of risk management and internal controls.

# Enterprise Risk Management and Risk Tolerance

The Manager has established a sound system of risk management and internal controls comprising procedures and processes to safeguard FCT's assets and the interests of FCT and its Unitholders. The ARCC reviews and reports to the Board on the adequacy and effectiveness of such controls, including financial, operational, compliance and information technology controls, and risk management procedures and systems, taking into consideration the recommendations of both internal and external auditors.

# Internal Controls

The ARCC, through the assistance of internal and external auditors, reviews and reports to the Board on the adequacy and effectiveness of the Manager's system of controls, including financial, operational, compliance and information technology controls. In assessing the effectiveness of internal controls, the ARCC ensures primarily that key objectives are met, material assets are properly safeguarded, fraud or errors (if any) in the accounting records are prevented or detected, accounting records are accurate and complete, and reliable financial information is prepared in compliance with applicable internal policies, laws and regulations.

The ARCC and the Board have been monitoring the rising interest rates, cost inflation pressures and global geopolitical tensions, which have an impact on FCT's financials and are working closely with Management on an ongoing basis. The ARCC and the Board are updated by Management regularly on the results of various scenario planning and stress testing to assess and track the possible impact on FCT's financials. Capital and liquidity management remain priorities for the Manager and FCT.

# Corporate Governance Report

# Risk Management

The Board, through the ARCC, reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of the Manager's risk management framework to ensure that robust risk management and mitigating controls are in place. The Manager has adopted an enterprise-wide risk management ("ERM") framework to enhance its risk management capabilities. Key risks, control measures and management actions are continually identified, reviewed and monitored as part of the ERM process. Financial and operational key risk indicators are in place to track key risk exposures. Apart from the ERM process, key business risks are thoroughly assessed by Management and each significant transaction is comprehensively analysed so that Management understands the risks involved before it is embarked upon. An outline of the Manager's ERM framework and progress report is set out on pages 91 to 94.

Periodic updates are provided to the ARCC on FCT's and the Manager's risk profiles. These updates would involve an assessment of FCT's and the Manager's key risks by risk categories, current status, the effectiveness of any mitigating measures taken, and the action plans undertaken by Management to manage such risks.

In addition to the ERM framework a comfort matrix of key risks, by which relevant material financial, compliance and operational (including information technology) risks of FCT and the Manager have been documented to assist the Board to assess the adequacy and effectiveness of the existing internal controls. The comfort matrix is prepared with reference to the strategies, policies, processes, systems and reporting processes connected with the management of such key risks and presented to the Board and the ARCC. Risk tolerance statements setting out the nature and extent of significant risks which the Manager is willing to take in achieving its strategic objectives and value creation have been formalised and adopted.

The Board has received assurance from the CEO and the CFO that as at 30 September 2023:

(a) the financial records of FCT have been properly maintained and the financial statements for FY2023 give a true and fair view of FCT's operations and finances;  
(b) the system of internal controls in place for FCT is adequate and effective to address financial, operational, compliance and information technology risks which the Manager considers relevant and material to FCT's operations; and  
(c) the risk management system in place for FCT is adequate and effective to address risks which the Manager considers relevant and material to FCT's operations.

# Board's Comment on Internal Controls and Risk Management Framework

Based on the internal controls established and maintained by the Manager, work performed by internal and external auditors, reviews performed by Management and the ARCC and assurance from the CEO and the CFO, the Board is of the view that the internal controls in place for FCT were adequate and effective as at 30 September 2023 to address financial, operational, compliance and information technology risks, which the Manager considers relevant and material to FCT's operations.

Based on the risk management framework established and adopted by the Manager, review performed by Management and assurance from the CEO and the CFO, the Board is of the view that the risk management system in place for FCT was adequate and effective as at 30 September 2023 to address risks which the Manager considers relevant and material to FCT's operations.

The Board notes that the system of internal controls and risk management provides reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that FCT will not be adversely affected by any event that could be reasonably foreseen as the Manager works to achieve its business objectives for FCT.

In this regard, the Board also notes that no system of internal controls and risk management can provide absolute assurance against the occurrence of material errors, poor judgement in decision-making, human error, losses, fraud or other irregularities.

The ARCC concurs with the Board's view that as at 30 September 2023, the internal controls of FCT (including financial, operational, compliance and information technology controls) and risk management systems in place for FCT were adequate and effective to address risks which the Manager considers relevant and material to FCT's operations.

# Corporate Governance Report

# Internal Audit

The internal audit function of the Manager is performed by FPL Group's internal audit department ("FPL Group IA"). FPL Group IA is responsible for conducting objective and independent assessments on the adequacy and effectiveness of the Manager's system of internal controls, risk management and governance practices. The Head of FPL Group IA reports directly to the ARCC and administratively, to FPL's Group Chief Corporate Officer. The appointment and removal of FPL Group IA as the service provider of the Manager's internal audit function requires the approval of the ARCC.

The ARCC ensures that FPL Group IA complies with the standards set by nationally or internationally recognised professional bodies. In this regard, in performing internal audit services, FPL Group IA has adopted and complies with the Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing set by The Institute of Internal Auditors, Inc.

The ARCC is also responsible for ensuring that the internal audit function is adequately resourced and staffed with persons with the relevant qualifications and experience. As at 30 September 2023, FPL Group IA comprised 25 professional staff. The Head of FPL Group IA and the Singapore-based FPL Group IA staff are members of The Institute of Internal Auditors, Singapore. To ensure that the internal audit activities are effectively performed, FPL Group IA recruits suitably qualified audit professionals with the requisite skills and experience. FPL Group IA staff are given relevant training and development opportunities to update their technical knowledge and auditing skills. This includes attending relevant technical workshops and seminars organised by The Institute of Internal Auditors, Singapore and other professional bodies.

FPL Group IA operates within the framework of a set of terms of reference as contained in the Internal Audit Charter approved by the ARCC. It adopts a risk-based audit methodology to develop its audit plan, and its activities are aligned with the key strategies of FCT. Risk assessments are carried out on all key business processes, which are used to determine the extent and the frequencies of the reviews to be performed. Higher risk areas are subject to more extensive and frequent reviews. FPL Group IA conducts its reviews based on the internal audit plan approved by the ARCC. FPL Group IA has unfettered access to FCT's and the Manager's documents, records, properties and personnel, including the ARCC members, and has appropriate standing with FCT and the Manager. All audit reports detailing audit findings and recommendations are provided to Management, who would respond with the actions to be taken.

Each quarter, FPL Group IA submits reports to the ARCC on the status of completion of the audit plan, audit findings noted from reviews performed, and status of Management's action plans to address such findings, including implementation of the audit recommendations. The ARCC is satisfied that for FY2023, the internal audit function is independent, effective, adequately resourced, and has appropriate standing within FCT and the Manager to perform its functions effectively. Quality assurance reviews on FPL Group's internal audit function are periodically carried out by qualified professionals from an external organisation. The last review was performed in FY2022. Where required, the ARCC will make recommendations to the Board to ensure that FPL Group IA remains an adequate, effective and independent internal audit function.

# Related/Interested Person Transactions

The Manager has established internal processes such that the Board, with the assistance of the ARCC, is required to be satisfied that all Related/Interested Person Transactions are undertaken on normal commercial terms, and are not prejudicial to the interests of FCT and the Unitholders. This may entail obtaining (where practicable) quotations from parties unrelated to the Manager, or obtaining one or more valuations from independent professional valuers (in accordance with the Property Funds Appendix). Directors who are interested in any proposed Related/Interested Person Transaction to be entered into by FCT are required to abstain from any deliberations or decisions in relation to that Related/Interested Person Transaction.

All Related/Interested Person Transactions are entered in a register maintained by the Manager. The Manager incorporates into its internal audit plan a review of the Related/Interested Person Transactions recorded in the register to ascertain that internal procedures and requirements of the SGX-ST Listing Manual and Property Funds Appendix have been complied with. The ARCC reviews the internal audit reports at least twice a year to ascertain that the guidelines and procedures established to monitor Related/Interested Person Transactions have been complied with. The review includes the examination of the nature of the Related/Interested Person Transactions and its supporting documents or such other data deemed necessary by the ARCC. In addition, the Trustee also has the right to review any such relevant internal audit reports to ascertain that the Property Funds Appendix has been complied with.

Any Related/Interested Person Transaction proposed to be entered into between FCT and an interested person, would require the Trustee to satisfy itself that such Related/Interested Person Transaction is conducted on normal commercial terms, is not prejudicial to the interests of FCT and its Unitholders, and is in accordance with all applicable requirements of the CIS Code and the SGX-ST Listing Manual.

# Corporate Governance Report

# Whistle-Blowing Policy

The Manager has put in place a whistle-blowing policy (the "Whistle-Blowing Policy"). The Whistle-Blowing Policy provides an independent feedback channel through which matters of concern about possible improprieties, misconduct or wrongdoing relating to FCT, the Manager and its officers in matters of financial reporting, suspected fraud and corruption or other matters may be raised by employees and any other persons in confidence and in good faith, without fear of reprisal. Whistle-Blowers may report any matters of concern by mail, email or calling a hotline, details of which are provided in the Whistle-Blowing Policy, which is available on FCT's website. Any report submitted through this channel would be received by the Head of the internal audit function and the Manager has designated FPL Group IA, an independent function, to investigate all whistle-blowing reports made in good faith. The Manager is committed to ensuring that whistle-blowers will be treated fairly, and protected from reprisals, victimisation or any otherwise detrimental or unfair treatment for whistle-blowing in good faith. The Manager will treat all information received confidentially and protect the identity of all whistle-blowers.

The improprieties, misconduct or wrongdoing that are reportable under the Whistle-Blowing Policy include: (a) financial or professional misconduct, including concerns about accounting, internal controls or auditing matters; (b) improper conduct, dishonest, fraudulent or unethical behaviour; (c) any criminal or regulatory offence, breach, irregularity or noncompliance with laws/regulations or the Manager's policies and procedures, and/or internal controls; (d) violence at the workplace, or any workplace hazards/violations which may threaten health and safety; (e) corruption or bribery; (f) conflicts of interest without proper disclosure; (g) any deliberate attempt to cover up and/or conceal misconduct and (h) any other improprieties or matters that may adversely affect Unitholders'/shareholders' interests in, and the assets of, FCT/the Manager as well as FCT's/the Manager's reputation. The Whistle-Blowing Policy is covered and explained in detail during staff training, including the procedures for raising concerns. All whistle-blowing complaints raised are independently investigated and if appropriate, an investigation committee will be constituted. The outcome of each investigation and any action taken is reported to the ARCC. The ARCC, which is responsible for oversight and monitoring of whistle-blowing, reviews and ensures that independent investigations and any appropriate follow-up actions are carried out (including reporting to the Board of any significant matters raised through the whistle-blowing channel).

# UNITHOLDER MATTERS

The Manager treats all Unitholders fairly and equitably in order to enable them to exercise their Unitholders' rights and have the opportunity to communicate their views on matters affecting FCT. Unitholders are also given accurate, objective, timely, balanced and understandable assessment of FCT's performance, financial position and prospects. The Manager provides regular updates via SGXNET announcements and on its websites and via participation in outreach retail investors events hosted by the Securities Investors Association (Singapore), securities brokers or the SGX-ST. Unitholders and investors can also contact the investor relations contact person at FCT to provide their feedback or submit enquiries. The AGMs provide a platform for Unitholders to communicate their views to FCT Board and Management on various matters affecting FCT.

# Investor Relations

The Manager prides itself on its high standards of disclosure and corporate transparency. The Manager aims to provide accurate, objective and timely information regarding FCT's performance and progress and matters concerning FCT and its business which are likely to materially affect the price or value of the Units or are likely to influence persons who commonly invest in securities in deciding whether or not to subscribe for, or buy or sell the Units, to Unitholders and the investment community, to enable them to make informed investment decisions.

The Manager's dedicated Investor Relations ("IR") manager is tasked with, and focuses on, facilitating communications between FCT and its Unitholders, as well as with the investment community, analysts and media. Contact details of the IR manager ("IR Contact") are available on FCT's website at https://www.frasersproperty.com/reits/fct for Unitholders, investors and other stakeholders to channel their comments and queries. The IR policy also sets out the mechanism through which Unitholders may contact the Manager with questions and through which the Manager may respond to such questions.

Continuous and informed dialogue between the Manager and Unitholders is a central tenet of good corporate governance. Regular engagement between these parties will promote greater transparency. Material and other pertinent information such as press releases and presentation slides are released to the SGX-ST via SGXNET and FCT's website. Announcements through SGXNET and FCT's website are the principal media of communication with Unitholders. In the interim business updates for the first and third quarters of each financial year, the Manager provides, inter alia, a discussion of the significant factors that affected FCT's interim performance as well as relevant market trends, including the risks and opportunities that may have a material impact on FCT's prospects. Such information provides Unitholders a better understanding of FCT's performance in the context of the current business environment.

# Corporate Governance Report

The Management (including the IR manager), participates in investor conferences, roadshows, and one-on-one meetings (including virtual meetings) to keep the investment community informed of FCT's corporate developments, financial and operational performance and strategies and in order to solicit and understand the views of Unitholders and investors. Analysts' briefings, conference calls and/or investors' post-results calls were conducted after the announcements of FY2023 financial results/business updates for each quarter. Audio casts of the Manager's presentations of FCT's half year and full year results are available on FCT's website on the day of release of the respective results.

Details of the IR activities during the year can be found in the Investor Relations section of this Annual Report on pages 22 to 24.

An electronic copy of this Annual Report is available on FCT's website at https://fct.frasersproperty.com/publications.html. Unitholders can also request for printed copies of this Annual Report via IR Contact.

The Trust Deed is also available for inspection upon request at the Manager's office<sup>4</sup>.

# Conduct of general meetings

The forthcoming  $15^{\text{th}}$  Annual General Meeting ("AGM 2024") will be held in a wholly physical format on 22 January 2024 and Unitholders (themselves or through duly appointed proxies) will be able to vote and ask questions in person at AGM 2024.

The Board supports and encourages active Unitholder participation at AGMs as it believes that general meetings serve as an opportune forum for Unitholders to meet the Board and senior Management, and to interact with them. As and when an extraordinary general meeting is convened, a circular is sent to Unitholders, containing details of the matters proposed for Unitholders' consideration and approval. To encourage participation, FCT's general meetings are held at convenient locations. Unitholders are given the opportunity to participate effectively and vote at FCT's general meetings, where relevant rules and procedures governing such meetings (for instance, how to vote) are clearly communicated prior to the start of the meeting. Unitholders such as nominee companies which provide custodial services for securities are not constrained by the two proxy limitation, and are able to appoint more than two proxies to attend, speak and vote at general meetings of FCT. At FCT's general meetings, Unitholders are also given opportunities to ask questions or give feedback to the Manager.

The Manager generally provides Unitholders with longer than the minimum notice period required for general meetings. The Manager tries its best not to schedule AGMs during peak periods when these might coincide with the AGMs of other listed companies. The Manager gives Unitholders the necessary information on each resolution so as to enable them to exercise their votes on an informed basis.

To safeguard the Unitholders' interests and rights, the Manager tables separate resolutions at general meetings of Unitholders on each substantially separate issue unless the issues are interdependent and linked so as to form one significant proposal. In the event where resolutions are bundled, the Manager will explain the reasons and material implications in the relevant notice of meeting. Unitholders are given the opportunity to raise questions and clarify any issues that they may have relating to the resolutions sought to be passed.

For greater transparency, the Manager has implemented electronic poll voting at general meetings. This entails Unitholders being invited to vote on each of the resolutions by poll, using an electronic voting system (instead of voting by hands), thereby allowing all Unitholders present or represented at the meeting to vote on a one Unit, one vote basis. The voting results of all votes cast for, against, or abstaining from each resolution is then screened at the meeting and announced via SGXNET after the meeting. An independent external party is appointed as scrutineer for the electronic voting process to count and validate the votes at general meetings. Provision 11.4 of the CG Code provides for an issuer's constitution to allow for absentia voting at general meetings of unitholders. The Trust Deed currently does not, however, permit Unitholders to vote at general meetings in absentia (such as via mail, email or fax). In line with Principle 11 of the CG Code, Unitholders nevertheless have the opportunity to appoint proxies to vote on his behalf at the meeting through proxy forms sent in advance. As the authentication of Unitholder identity and other related security and integrity issues remain a concern, for FY2023, the REIT Manager did not implement absentia voting methods such as voting via mail, email or fax.

# Corporate Governance Report

At the AGM, the Manager will make a presentation to update Unitholders on FCT's financial and operational performance for the financial year. The presentation materials are made available on SGXNET and FCT's website before the commencement of the AGM for the benefit of Unitholders.

Board members and senior Management are present at, and for the entire duration of, each Unitholders' meeting to respond to any questions from Unitholders, unless they are unable to attend due to exigencies. Certain external consultants including FCT's external auditors are also present to address queries about the conduct of audit and the preparation and content of the auditors' report.

The Chairman of the meeting is tasked with facilitating constructive dialogue between the Unitholders and the Board, Management and the external auditors. Where appropriate, the Chairman allows specific Directors, such as the respective Board Committee chairpersons, to answer queries on matters related to their roles. Unitholders are also given an opportunity to interact with the Directors before and/or after general meetings.

The minutes of Unitholders' meetings which include the attendance of Board members at the meetings, matters approved by Unitholders, voting results and substantial and relevant comments or queries from Unitholders relating to the agenda of the general meeting together with responses from the Board and Management, are prepared by the Manager. The minutes will be published on FCT's website within one month from the date of the meeting.

# Distributions

FCT's distribution policy is to distribute at least  $90.0\%$  of its taxable income, comprising substantially its income from the letting of its properties and related property maintenance services income after deduction of allowable expenses and such distributions are typically paid on a half-yearly basis. For FY2023, the distribution for the first half-year (for the period from 1 October 2022 to 31 March 2023) was made on 30 May 2023. The distribution for the second half-year (for the period from 1 April 2023 to 30 September 2023) was made on 29 November 2023.

# STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

The Board adopts an inclusive approach by considering and balancing the needs and interests of material stakeholders, as part of its overall responsibility to ensure that the best interests of FCT are served. Stakeholders are parties who may be affected by FCT's or the Manager's activities or whose actions can affect the ability of FCT or the Manager to conduct its activities.

# Sustainability

In order to review and assess the material factors relevant to FCT's business activities, the Manager from time to time proactively engages with various stakeholders, including employees, vendors and tenants, and the investment community, to gather feedback on the sustainability matters which have significant impact to the business and operations of FCT and its stakeholders. Please refer to the Sustainability Report on pages 93 to 136 of this Annual Report, which sets out information on the Manager's arrangements to identify and engage with its material stakeholder groups and to manage its relationships with such groups, and the Manager's strategy and key areas of focus in relation to the management of stakeholder relationships during FY2023.

# Responsible sourcing

The Manager has put in place a Responsible Sourcing Policy which sets out expectations of contractors and suppliers across four areas of sustainable procurement, namely environmental management; human rights and labour management; health, safety, and well-being; and business ethics and integrity. The policy is informed by the UN Global Compact Principles and the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

# Code of Business Conduct

The conduct of employees of the Manager is governed by the FPL Code of Business Conduct. The FPL Group's business practices are governed by integrity, honesty, fair dealing and compliance with applicable laws. To guide FPL Group's employees across its multi-national network to uphold these values, FPL has established the FPL Code of Business Conduct to provide clear guidelines on ethics and relationships to safeguard the interests and reputation of the FPL Group, including the Manager, as well as its stakeholders.

# Corporate Governance Report

The FPL Code of Business Conduct covers key aspects such as avoiding conflicts of interest, working with external stakeholders (including customers, suppliers, business partners, governments and regulatory officials), protecting company's assets, social media engagement, data privacy and upholding laws in countries where the FPL Group has geographical presence in. The FPL Code of Business Conduct also emphasises the importance of upholding FPL's core values to build a respectful culture. Employees are encouraged to be respectful to the elements that make people similar or different from one another, including background, views, experiences, capabilities, values, beliefs, physical differences, ethnicity and culture, gender, age, thinking styles, preferences and behaviours.

The FPL Code of Business Conduct sets out the policies and procedures dealing with various issues such as conflicts of interests, the maintenance of records and reports, equal employment opportunities and sexual harassment. It includes requirements relating to the keeping of accurate and sufficiently detailed accounting records for financial transactions, internal financial reporting and financial reporting to stakeholders, sets out the standards to which employees must adhere in their business relationships with third parties and personal business undertakings and their obligations to the FPL Group, and provides for the need to obtain approval in certain situations where a conflict of interest may arise. It also covers an employee's obligations in protecting the FPL Group's confidential information and intellectual property and reiterates the FPL Group's zero tolerance approach to bribery and corruption.

Where applicable/appropriate, the FPL Code of Business Conduct is also made available to other stakeholders such as the Manager's agents, suppliers, business associates and customers.

# Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism Measures

The Manager has a policy and procedures in place to comply with applicable anti-money laundering, counter-terrorism financing laws and regulations, including the notice and guidelines issued by the MAS to capital intermediaries on the prevention of money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism. The Manager's policy and procedures include, but are not limited to, risk assessment and mitigation, customer due diligence, reporting of suspicious transactions, and record keeping. Training on anti-money laundering, counter-terrorism financing laws and regulations are also conducted for employees, officers and representatives periodically and as and when needed.

# Business Continuity Management

FCT has in place a Group Business Continuity Management ("BCM") Policy which references the requirements of ISO 22301 management system. The policy sets the directives and guides the Manager in implementing and maintaining a BCM programme to protect against, reduce the likelihood of the occurrence of, prepare for, respond to and recover from disruptions when they arise.

The Manager has in FY2023, enhanced its BCM programme which has boosted its resilience and capability in responding, managing, and recovering from adverse business disruptions and unforeseen catastrophic events. Under the programme, critical business functions, key processes, resource requirements, service recovery time objectives and business recovery strategies are identified. Management has identified and mapped end-to-end dependencies covering people, processes, technology and other resources (including third parties and intragroup) that support each critical business service. Management has put in place a robust and effective incident management programme to manage incidents to recover the critical business services and functions to prepare itself within the stipulated recovery time objectives. A Crisis Management Team has been established to oversee the Manager's crisis management activities. Group Internal Audit (as an independent and qualified party) has been engaged to establish a comprehensive BCM audit plan and conduct an audit of the BCM framework and the BCM of each critical business service at least once every three years.

Annual tests, exercises (tabletop or simulated) and drills, simulating different scenarios, will be carried out to assess the effectiveness of the abovementioned plans. The Manager's Crisis Management Team and staff are trained periodically, and the plans under the BCM are updated regularly. The BCM programme ensures FCT stays resilient in the face of a crisis. It is a holistic approach to minimise adverse business impact and to safeguard FCT's reputation and business operations.

The FPL Code of Business Conduct, the BCM Policy and the other policies mentioned above, are accessible to all employees on the FPL Group intranet.

# Corporate Governance Report

# POLICY ON DEALINGS IN SECURITIES

The Manager has established a dealing policy on securities trading ("Dealing Policy") setting out the procedure for dealings in FCT's securities by its Directors, officers and employees. In compliance with Rule 1207(19) of the SGX-ST Listing Manual on best practices on dealing in securities, the Group issues reminders to its Directors, officers and employees on the restrictions in dealings in listed securities of the Group during the period commencing (a) two weeks prior to the announcement of the interim business updates of the first and third quarters of the financial year, and (b) one month before the announcement of the half-year and full year results, and ending on the date of such announcements (the "Prohibition Period"). Directors, officers and employees are also reminded not to trade in listed securities of FCT at any time while in possession of unpublished price sensitive information and to refrain from dealing in FCT's securities on short-term considerations. Pursuant to the SFA, Directors and the CEO are also required to report their dealings in FCT's securities within two business days.

Every quarter, each Director, officer and employee is required to complete and submit a declaration form to the designated compliance officer to report any trades he/she made in Units in the previous quarter and confirm that no trades were made during the Prohibition Period. A quarterly report will be provided to the ARCC. Any non-compliance with the Dealing Policy will be reported to the ARCC for its review and instructions.

In compliance with the Dealing Policy in relation to the Manager, prior approval from the Board is required before the Manager deals or trades in Units. The Manager has undertaken that it will not deal in Units:

(i) during the Prohibition Period; or  
(ii) whenever it is in possession of unpublished price sensitive information/material in relation to those securities.

# ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE ON FEES PAYABLE TO THE MANAGER

Pursuant to the Trust Deed, the Manager is entitled to receive the following fees:

<table><tr><td>Type of Fee</td><td>Computation and Form of Payment</td><td>Rationale and Purpose</td></tr><tr><td>Base Fee</td><td>Pursuant to Clause 15.1.1 of the Trust Deed, the Manager is entitled to receive a Base Fee not exceeding the rate of 0.3% per annum of the Value of FCT&#x27;s Deposited Property.
The Base Fee is payable quarterly in the form of cash and/or Units as the Manager may elect.</td><td>The Base Fee compensates the Manager for the costs incurred in managing FCT, which includes overheads, day-to-day operational costs, compliance, monitoring and reporting costs as well as administrative expenses.
The Base Fee is calculated at a fixed percentage of asset value as the scope of the Manager&#x27;s duties is commensurate with the size of FCT&#x27;s asset portfolio.</td></tr><tr><td>Performance Fee</td><td>Pursuant to Clause 15.1.2 of the Trust Deed, the Manager is entitled to receive a Performance Fee equal to a rate of 5.0% per annum of the Net Property Income of FCT (calculated before accounting for the Performance Fee in that financial year) or (as the case may be) Special Purpose Vehicles for each Financial Year accrued to the Manager and remaining unpaid.
The Performance Fee is payable in the form of cash and/or Units as the Manager may elect.
With effect from 1 October 2016, the Performance Fee shall be paid annually, in compliance with the Property Funds Appendix.</td><td>The Performance Fee, which is based on Net Property Income, aligns the interests of the Manager with Unitholders as the Manager is incentivised to proactively focus on improving rentals and optimising the operating costs and expenses of FCT&#x27;s properties. Linking the Performance Fee to Net Property Income will also motivate the Manager to ensure the long-term sustainability of the assets instead of taking on excessive short-term risks to the detriment of Unitholders.</td></tr></table>

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Frasers Centrepoint Trust (the "Trust") and its subsidiaries (the "Group"), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position and consolidated portfolio statement of the Group and the statement of financial position of the Trust as at 30 September 2023, the consolidated statement of total return, consolidated distribution statement, consolidated statement of movements in unitholders' funds and consolidated statement of cash flows of the Group and the statement of movements in unitholders' funds of the Trust for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies as set out on pages 186 to 255.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Group and the statement of financial position and statement of movements in unitholders' funds of the Trust present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position and the consolidated portfolio holdings of the Group and the financial position of the Trust as at 30 September 2023 and the consolidated total return, consolidated distributable income, consolidated movements in unitholders' funds and consolidated cash flows of the Group and the movements in unitholders' funds of the Trust for the year ended on that date in accordance with the recommendations of Statement of Recommended Accounting Practice 7 ("RAP 7") Reporting Framework for Investment Funds issued by the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants (the "ISCA").

# Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing ("SSAs"). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the 'Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements' section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority ("ACRA") Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities ("ACRA Code") together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Singapore, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ACRA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

# Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

(Constituted under a Trust Deed (as amended, restated and supplemented) in the Republic of Singapore)

Valuation of investment properties

(Refer to Portfolio Statement and Note 4 to the financial statements)

Risk

The Group owns retail malls and an office building located in Singapore that are leased to third parties under operating leases. As at 30 September 2023, the investment properties with carrying amount of $5.22 billion represent the single largest asset category on the consolidated statement of financial position of the Group.

The investment properties are stated at their fair values based on independent external valuations. The valuation process is considered a key audit matter because it involves significant judgement in determining the appropriate valuation methodology to be used, and in estimating the underlying assumptions to be applied. The valuations are sensitive to key assumptions applied and a change in the assumptions may have a significant impact on the valuations.

Our response

We evaluated the qualifications and competence of the external valuers. We considered the valuation methodologies used against those applied by other valuers for similar property types. We evaluated the appropriateness of the key assumptions used in the valuations by comparing them against available industry data, taking into consideration comparability and market factors. Where the assumptions were outside the expected range, we undertook further procedures to understand the effect of additional factors taken into account in the valuations.

Our findings

The external valuers are members of generally-recognised professional bodies for valuers and have considered their own independence in carrying out their work. The valuation methodologies used were in line with generally accepted market practices and the key assumptions used were generally comparable to available market data. Where the assumptions were outside the expected range, the additional factors considered by the external valuers were consistent with other corroborative evidence.

Other information

Frasers Centrepoint Asset Management Ltd., the Manager of the Trust (the "Manager"), is responsible for the other information contained in the annual report. Other information is defined as all information in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditors' report thereon.

We have obtained all other information prior to the date of this auditors' report except for the Sustainability Report and the Statistics of Unitholdings which are expected to be made available to us after that date.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditors' report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

When we read the Sustainability Report and the Statistics of Unitholdings, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to the Manager and take appropriate actions in accordance with SSAs.

# Independent Auditors' Report

To the Unitholders

Frasers Centrepoint Trust

(Constituted under a Trust Deed (as amended, restated and supplemented) in the Republic of Singapore)

Responsibilities of the Manager for the financial statements

The Manager is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with the recommendations of RAP 7 issued by the ISCA, and for such internal control as the Manager determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Manager is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Manager either intends to terminate the Group or to cease operations of the Group, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The Manager's responsibilities include overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.

Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.  
- Obtain an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal controls.  
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Manager.  
- Conclude on the appropriateness of the Manager's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.  
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.  
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

# Independent Auditors' Report

To the Unitholders

Frasers Centrepoint Trust

(Constituted under a Trust Deed (as amended, restated and supplemented) in the Republic of Singapore)

We communicate with the Manager regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the Manager with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Manager, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditors' report is Sarina Lee.

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the recommendations of Statement of Recommended Accounting Practice ("RAP") 7 Reporting Framework for Investment Funds issued by the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants ("ISCA"), the applicable requirements of the Code on Collective Investment Schemes (the "CIS Code") issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore ("MAS") and the provisions of the Trust Deed. RAP 7 requires the accounting policies to generally comply with the principles relating to recognition and measurement under the Financial Reporting Standards in Singapore ("FRSs").

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except as otherwise described in the notes below.

These financial statements are presented in Singapore dollars, which is the Trust's functional currency. All financial information presented in Singapore dollars have been rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise stated.

# Notes to the Financial Statements

For the year ended 30 September 2023

# 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONT'D)

# 2.1 Basis of preparation (cont'd)

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with RAP 7 requires the Manager to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are revised on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised prospectively.

Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment within the next financial year are included in Note 4 - Valuation of investment properties.

# Measurement of fair values

A number of the Group's accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses observable market data as far as possible. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:

Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group can access at the measurement date;

Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices); and

Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement (with Level 3 being the lowest).

The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as at the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.

# 2.2 Changes in accounting policies

# New and amended standards adopted by the Group

The Group has applied the following FRSs and amendments to FRSs for the first time for the annual period beginning on 1 October 2022:

- Amendments to FRS 103: Reference to the Conceptual Framework  
Amendments to FRS 16: Property, Plant and Equipment - Proceeds before Intended Use  
Amendments to FRS 37: Onerous Contracts - Cost of fulfilling a Contract  
Annual Improvements to FRSs 2018-2020  
- Amendments to FRS 12: International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules

Based on Amendments to FRS 12: International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules, the Group has applied the exception to recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes.

The Group's adoption of the new standards and amendments to FRSs does not have a material impact on the financial statements.

# Notes to the Financial Statements

# 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accounting policies set out below have been applied by the Group entities consistently to all the periods presented in these financial statements, except as explained in Note 2.2, which addresses changes in accounting policies arising from the adoption of new standards.

# 3.1 Basis of consolidation

# (i) Business combinations

The Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when the acquired set of activities and assets meets the definition of a business and control is transferred to the Group. In determining whether a particular set of activities and assets is a business, the Group assesses whether the set of assets and activities acquired includes, at a minimum, an input and substantive process and whether the acquired set has the ability to produce outputs.

The Group has an option to apply a 'concentration test' that permits a simplified assessment of whether an acquired set of activities and assets is not a business. The optional concentration test is met if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets.

The Group measures goodwill at the date of acquisition as:

the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus  
the recognised amount of any non-controlling interest ("NCI") in the acquiree; plus  
- if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the pre-existing equity interest in the acquiree,

over the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment.

When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in the statement of total return.

The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in the statement of total return.

Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the date of acquisition and included in the consideration transferred. If the contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within unitholders' funds. Otherwise, other contingent consideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in the statement of total return.

NCI (if any) that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of the acquiree's net assets in the event of liquidation are measured either at fair value or at the NCI's proportionate share of the recognised amounts of the acquiree's identifiable net assets, at the date of acquisition. The measurement basis taken is elected on a transaction-by-transaction basis. All other NCI are measured at acquisition-date fair value, unless another measurement basis is required by FRSs.

Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity investments, that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.

Changes in the Group's interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.

# 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)

# 3.1 Basis of consolidation (cont'd)

# (ii) Subsidiaries

A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of a subsidiary are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.

The accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed when necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Group. Losses applicable to the NCI in a subsidiary are allocated to the NCI even if doing so causes the NCI to have a deficit balance.

In the Trust's statement of financial position, investment in subsidiary is accounted for at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.

When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any related NCI and other components of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in the statement of total return. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost.

# (iii) Investments in associate and joint ventures (equity-accounted investees)

An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence over the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but does not have control or joint control of those policies. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group has  $20\%$  or more of the voting power of another entity.

A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities.

Investments in associate and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. They are recognised initially at cost, which includes transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income ("OCI") of equity-accounted investees, after adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the Group, from the date that significant influence or joint control commences until the date that significant influence or joint control ceases.

When the Group's share of losses exceeds its investment in equity-accounted investee, the carrying amount of the investment, together with any long-term interests that form part thereof, is reduced to zero, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an obligation to fund the investee's operations or has made payments on behalf of the investee.

The financial statements of the associate and joint ventures are prepared as the same reporting date as the Trust. Where necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group.

In the Trust's separate financial statements, interests in joint ventures and associate are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

A list of the associate and joint ventures is shown in Notes 7 and 8, respectively.

# (iv) Transactions eliminated on consolidation

Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group's interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.

# 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)

# 3.1 Basis of consolidation (cont'd)

# (v) Property acquisitions and business combinations

Where property is acquired, via corporate acquisitions or otherwise, management considers the substance of the assets and activities of the acquired entity in determining whether the acquisition represents the acquisition of a business or the acquisition of an asset. The Group accounts for an acquisition as a business combination where an integrated set of activities is acquired in addition to the property. More specifically, consideration is made of the extent to which significant processes are acquired and, in particular, the extent of services provided by the subsidiary.

When the acquisition does not represent a business, it is accounted for as an acquisition of a group of assets and liabilities. The cost of the acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based upon their relative fair values, and no goodwill or deferred tax is recognised.

# 3.2 Earnings per Unit

The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per Unit data for its Units. Basic earnings per Unit is calculated by dividing the total return attributable to Unitholders of the Group by the weighted-average number of units outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per Unit is determined by adjusting the total return attributable to Unitholders and the weighted-average number of units outstanding, for the effects of all dilutive potential Units.

# 3.3 Expenses

# (i) Property expenses

Property expenses are recognised on an accrual basis. Included in property expenses are property management fees which are based on the applicable formula stipulated in Note 1.1.

# (ii) Asset management fees

Asset management fees are recognised on an accrual basis based on the applicable formula stipulated in Note 1.2.

# (iii) Trustee's fees

Trustee's fees are recognised on an accrual basis based on the applicable formula stipulated in Note 1.3.

# 3.4 Financial instruments

# (i) Recognition and initial measurement

# Non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities

Trade receivables are initially recognised when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

A financial asset (unless it is a trade receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss ("FVTPL"), transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price.

# 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)

# 3.4 Financial instruments (cont'd)

# (ii) Classification and subsequent measurement

# Non-derivative financial assets

On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at amortised cost.

The classification depends on the Group's business model for managing the financial assets as well as the contractual terms of the cash flows of the financial asset.

Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest.

The Group reclassifies financial assets when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes.

# Financial assets at amortised cost

A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:

it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and  
- its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

# Financial assets: Business model assessment

The Group makes an assessment of the objective of the business model in which a financial asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to management. The information considered includes:

- the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. These include whether management's strategy focuses on earning contractual interest income, maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of any related liabilities or expected cash outflows or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets;  
- how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Group's management;  
- the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and how those risks are managed; and  
the frequency, volume and timing of sales of financial assets in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and expectations about future sales activity.

Transfers of financial assets to third parties in transactions that do not qualify for derecognition are not considered sales for this purpose, consistent with the Group's continuing recognition of the assets.

# 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)

# 3.4 Financial instruments (cont'd)

# (ii) Classification and subsequent measurement (cont'd)

# Non-derivative financial assets: Assessment whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest

For the purposes of this assessment, 'principal' is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. 'Interest' is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g. liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as a profit margin.

In assessing whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the Group considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making this assessment, the Group considers:

contingent events that would change the amount or timing of cash flows;  
- terms that may adjust the contractual coupon rate, including variable rate features;  
- prepayment and extension features; and  
- terms that limit the Group's claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse features).

A prepayment feature is consistent with the solely payments of principal and interest criterion if the prepayment amount substantially represents unpaid amounts of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, which may include reasonable additional compensation for early termination of the contract. Additionally, for a financial asset acquired at a significant discount or premium to its contractual par amount, a feature that permits or requires prepayment at an amount that substantially represents the contractual par amount plus accrued (but unpaid) contractual interest (which may also include reasonable additional compensation for early termination) is treated as consistent with this criterion if the fair value of the prepayment feature is insignificant at initial recognition.

# Non-derivative financial assets: Subsequent measurement and gains and losses

# Financial assets at amortised cost

These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in the statement of total return. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in the statement of total return.

# Non-derivative financial liabilities: Classification, subsequent measurement and gains and losses

Financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost. Directly attributable transaction costs are recognised in the statement of total return as incurred.

Other financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in the statement of total return.

# 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)

# 3.4 Financial instruments (cont'd)

# (ii) Classification and subsequent measurement (cont'd)

# Interest rate benchmark reform

When the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of a financial asset or financial liability measured at amortised cost changed as a result of interest rate benchmark reform, the Group updated the effective interest rate of the financial asset or financial liability to reflect the change that is required by the reform. No immediate gain or loss is recognised. A change in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows is required by interest rate benchmark reform if the following conditions are met:

the change is necessary as a direct consequence of the reform; and  
- the new basis for determining the contractual cash flows is economically equivalent to the previous basis - i.e. the basis immediately before the change.

When changes were made to a financial asset or financial liability in addition to changes to the basis for determining the contractual cash flows required by interest rate benchmark reform, the Group first updated the effective interest rate of the financial asset or financial liability to reflect the change that is required by interest rate benchmark reform. After that, the Group applied the policies on accounting for modifications to the additional changes.

# (iii) Derecognition

# Financial assets

The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.

The Group enters into transactions whereby it transfers assets recognised in its statements of financial position but retains either all or substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets. In these cases, the transferred assets are not derecognised.

# Financial liabilities

The Group derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire. The Group also derecognises a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value.

On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in the statement of total return.

# (iv) Offsetting

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statements of financial position when, and only when, the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

For the year ended 30 September 2023

# 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)

# 3.4 Financial instruments (cont'd)

# (v) Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short-term deposits with maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in their fair value, and are used by the Group in the management of its short-term commitments.

# (vi) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting

The Group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency and interest rate risk exposures. Embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if the host contract is not a financial asset and certain criteria are met.

Derivatives are initially measured at fair value and any directly attributable transaction costs are recognised in the statement of total return as incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are generally recognised in the statement of total return.

The Group designates certain derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments as hedging instruments in qualifying hedging relationships. At inception of designated hedging relationships, the Group documents the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The Group also documents the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, including whether the changes in cash flows of the hedged item and hedging instrument are expected to offset each other.

# Cash flow hedges

The Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments to hedge the variability in cash flows associated with highly probable forecast transactions arising from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.

When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised in unitholders' funds and accumulated in the hedging reserve. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative that is recognised in unitholders' funds is limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item, determined on a present value basis, from inception of the hedge. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised immediately in the statement of total return.

If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the hedging instrument is sold, expires, is terminated or is exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. When hedge accounting for cash flow hedges is discontinued, the amount that has been accumulated in the hedging reserve and the cost of hedging reserve remains in unitholders' funds until it is reclassified to the statement of total return in the same period or periods as the hedged expected future cash flows affect the statement of total return.

If the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur, then the amounts that have been accumulated in the hedging reserve and the cost of hedging reserve are immediately reclassified to the statement of total return.

# Hedges directly affected by interest rate benchmark reform

When the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of the hedged item or hedging instrument changes as a result of interest rate benchmark reform and therefore there is no longer uncertainty arising about the cash flows of the hedged item or the hedging instrument, the Group amends the hedge documentation of that hedging relationship to reflect the change(s) required by interest rate benchmark reform. A change in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows is required by interest rate benchmark reform if the following conditions are met:

- the change is necessary as a direct consequence of the reform; and  
- the new basis for determining the contractual cash flows is economically equivalent to the previous basis - i.e. the basis immediately before the change.

For this purpose, the hedge designation is amended only to make one or more of the following changes:

- designating an alternative benchmark rate as the hedged risk;  
- updating the description of the hedged item, including the description of the designated portion of the cash flows or fair value being hedged; or  
- updating the description of the hedging instrument.

The Group amends the description of the hedging instrument only if the following conditions are met:

- it makes a change required by interest rate benchmark reform by changing the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of the hedging instrument or using another approach that is economically equivalent to changing the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of the original hedging instrument; and  
the original hedging instrument is not derecognised.

The Group amends the formal hedge documentation by the end of the reporting period during which a change required by interest rate benchmark reform is made to the hedged risk, hedged item or hedging instrument. These amendments in the formal hedge documentation do not constitute the discontinuation of the hedging relationship or the designation of a new hedging relationship.

If changes are made in addition to those changes required by interest rate benchmark reform described above, then the Group first considers whether those additional changes result in the discontinuation of the hedge accounting relationship. If the additional changes do not result in the discontinuation of the hedge accounting relationship, then the Group amends the formal hedge documentation for changes required by interest rate benchmark reform as mentioned above.

When the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged future cash flows had been based is changed as required by interest rate benchmark reform, for the purpose of determining whether the hedged future cash flows are expected to occur, the Group deems that the hedging reserve recognised in unitholders' funds for that hedging relationship is based on the alternative benchmark rate on which the hedged future cash flows will be based.

# 3.5 Fixed assets

# (i) Recognition and measurement

Items of fixed assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset.

If significant parts of an item of fixed asset have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of fixed asset.

The gain or loss on disposal of an item of fixed asset is recognised in the statement of total return.

# (ii) Subsequent costs

The cost of replacing a component of an item of fixed asset is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the component will flow to the Group, and its cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced component is derecognised. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of fixed asset are recognised in the statement of total return as incurred.

# (iii) Depreciation

Depreciation is based on the cost of an asset less its residual value. Significant components of individual assets are assessed and if a component has a useful life that is different from the remainder of that asset, that component is depreciated separately.

Depreciation is recognised as an expense in the statement of total return on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each component of an item of fixed asset, unless it is included in the carrying amount of another asset.

Depreciation is recognised from the date that the fixed assets are installed and are ready for use. The estimated useful lives are 2 years to 10 years.

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted if appropriate.

# 3.6 Foreign currency

# (i) Foreign currency transactions

Transactions in foreign currencies are measured and recorded on initial recognition in Singapore dollars, the functional currency of the Group entities, at exchange rates at the dates of transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated at the exchange rate at that date.

Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are translated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items in a foreign currency that are measured in terms of historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Foreign currency differences arising on translation are generally recognised in statement of total return. However, foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the following items are recognised in unitholders' fund:

an equity investment designated as at fair value through other comprehensive income ("FVOCI");  
- a financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation to the extent that the hedge is effective; and  
- qualifying cash flow hedges to the extent that the hedges are effective.

# 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)

# 3.6 Foreign currency (cont'd)

# (ii) Foreign operations

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated to Singapore dollars at exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated to Singapore dollars at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.

Foreign currency differences are recognised in unitholders' funds. However, if the foreign operation is a non wholly-owned subsidiary, then the relevant proportionate share of the translation difference is allocated to the NCI. When a foreign operation is disposed of such control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount in the translation reserve related to that foreign operation is reclassified to statement of total return as part of the gain or loss on disposal. When the Group disposes of only part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation while retaining control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reattributed to NCI. When the Group disposes of only part of its investment in an associate or joint venture that includes a foreign operation while retaining significant influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to statement of total return.

When the settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from such a monetary item that are considered to form part of a net investment in a foreign operation are recognised in the translation reserve in unitholders' funds.

# 3.7 Leases

At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

# As a lessor

At inception or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices.

When the Group acts as a lessor, it determines at lease inception whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating lease.

To classify each lease, the Group makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease; if not, then it is an operating lease. As part of this assessment, the Group considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset.

If an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, then the Group applies FRS 115 to allocate the consideration in the contract.

The Group recognises lease payments received from investment property under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term as part of 'revenue'.

# Notes to the Financial Statements

# 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)

# 3.8 Impairment

# (i) Non-derivative financial assets

The Group recognises loss allowances for expected credit losses ("ECLs") on financial assets measured at amortised cost and lease receivables.

Loss allowances of the Group are measured on either of the following bases:

12-month ECLs: these are ECLs that result from default events that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date (or for a shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less than 12 months); or  
Lifetime ECLs: these are ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument.

# Simplified approach

The Group applies the simplified approach to provide for ECLs for all trade receivables (including lease receivables). The simplified approach requires the loss allowance to be measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs.

# General approach

The Group applies the general approach to provide for ECLs on all other financial instruments. Under the general approach, the loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to 12-month ECLs at initial recognition.

At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether the credit risk of a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition. When credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs.

When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECLs, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group's historical experience and informed credit assessment and includes forward-looking information.

If credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition or if the credit quality of the financial instruments improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to 12-month ECLs.

The Group considers a financial asset to be in default when the debtor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Group in full, without recourse by the Group to actions such as realising security (if any is held), or when the financial asset is more than 90 days past due.

The maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the Group is exposed to credit risk.

# Measurement of ECLs

ECLs are probability-weighted estimates of credit losses. Credit losses are measured at the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive). ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset.

# 3.8 Impairment (cont'd)

# (i) Non-derivative financial assets (cont'd)

# Credit-impaired financial assets

At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost are credit-impaired. A financial asset is 'credit-impaired' when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.

Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:

significant financial difficulty of the debtor;  
a breach of contract such as a default or being more than 90 days past due;  
the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise;  
it is probable that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or  
the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.

# Presentation of allowance for ECLs in the statements of financial position

Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of these assets.

The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or in full) to the extent that there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when the Group determines that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group's procedures for recovery of amounts due.

# (ii) Non-financial assets

The carrying amounts of the Group's non-financial assets, other than investment properties, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the assets' recoverable amounts are estimated. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit ("CGU") exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the statement of total return.

The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGU.

Impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

# 3.8 Impairment (cont'd)

# (ii) Non-financial assets (cont'd)

An impairment loss in respect of an associate or joint venture is measured by comparing the recoverable amount of the investment with its carrying amount in accordance with the requirements for non-financial assets. An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of total return. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a favourable change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount and only to the extent that the recoverable amount increases.

Goodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of an investment in associate or joint venture is not recognised separately, and therefore is not tested for impairment separately. Instead, the entire amount of the investment in associate or joint venture is tested for impairment as a single asset when there is objective evidence that the investment in associate or joint venture may be impaired.

# 3.9 Finance income and finance costs

The Group's finance income and finance costs include:

interest income;  
interest expense;  
- hedge ineffectiveness in statement of total return; and  
amortisation of transaction costs.

Interest income or expense is recognised using the effective interest method.

The 'effective interest rate' is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to:

the gross carrying amount of the financial asset; or  
the amortised cost of the financial liability.

In calculating interest income and expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset (when the asset is not credit-impaired) or to the amortised cost of the liability. However, for financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset. If the asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis.

Finance costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are recognised in statement of total return using the effective interest method.

# 3.10 Investment properties

Investment properties are properties held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or for both, but not for sale in the ordinary course of business, use in production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes. Investment properties are measured at cost on initial recognition and subsequently at fair value thereafter. Valuation is determined in accordance with the Trust Deed, which requires the investment properties to be valued by independent registered valuers.

In such manner and frequency required under the CIS Code issued by the MAS; and  
At least in each period of 12 months following the acquisition of each parcel of real estate property.

Any increase or decrease on revaluation is credited or charged to the statement of total return as a net change in fair value of the investment properties.

Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the investment property. Any gain or loss on disposal of an investment property (calculated as the difference between the net proceeds from disposal and the carrying amount of the item) is recognised in the statement of total return.

Investment properties are not depreciated. Investment properties are subject to continual maintenance and regularly revalued on the basis set out above. For taxation purposes, the Group entities may claim capital allowances on assets that qualify as plant and machinery under the Singapore Income Tax Act.

# 3.11 Provisions

A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance costs.

# 3.12 Revenue recognition

# Gross rental income

Gross rental income, which include lease incentives, is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term commencing on the date from which the lessee is entitled to exercise its right to use the leased asset.

# Gross turnover rental income

Contingent rentals, which include gross turnover rental income, are recognised as income in the accounting period in which it is earned and the amount can be reliably measured.

# Car park income

Car park income consists of season and hourly parking income. Season parking income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable lease term. Hourly parking income is recognised at a point of time upon the utilisation of car parking facilities.

# 3.13 Security deposits

Security deposits mainly comprise of rental deposits and utility deposits received from tenants at the Group's investment properties. The accounting policy for security deposits as financial liabilities is set out in Note 3.4.

# 3.14 Segment reporting

An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group's other components. All operating segments' operating results are reviewed regularly by the Board of Directors of the Manager to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.

Segment results that are reported to the Board of Directors of the Manager include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly finance costs and asset management fees.

Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred to acquire investment properties and fixed assets.

# 3.15 Taxation

Tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax expense are recognised in the statement of total return except to the extent that it relates to an item recognised directly in unitholders' funds.

The Group has determined that interest and penalties related to income taxes, including uncertain tax treatments, do not meet the definition of income taxes, and therefore accounted for them under FRS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.

Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax payable or receivable is the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received that reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any.

Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met.

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.

Deferred tax is not recognised for temporary differences that:

- temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;  
- temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and  
- taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.

The measurement of deferred taxes reflects the tax consequences that would follow the manner in which the Group expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. For investment property that is measured at fair value, the presumption that the carrying amount of the investment property will be recovered through sale has not been rebutted. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date, and reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

# 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)

# 3.15 Taxation (cont'd)

Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Future taxable profits are determined based on the reversal of relevant taxable temporary differences. If the amount of taxable temporary differences is insufficient to recognise a deferred tax asset in full, then future taxable profits, adjusted for reversals of existing temporary differences, are considered, based on the business plans for individual subsidiaries in the Group. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised; such reductions are reversed when the probability of future taxable profits improves.

Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used.

# Tax transparency

The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore ("IRAS") has issued a tax ruling on the income tax treatment of the Trust. Subject to meeting the terms and conditions of the tax ruling which includes a distribution of at least  $90\%$  of the taxable income of the Trust, the Trustee will not be assessed to tax on the taxable income of the Trust. Instead, the distributions made by the Trust out of such taxable income are subject to tax in the hands of Unitholders, unless they are exempt from tax on the Trust's distributions (the "tax transparency ruling"). Accordingly, the Trustee and the Manager will deduct income tax at the prevailing corporate tax rate from the distributions made to Unitholders that are made out of the taxable income of the Trust, except:

- where the beneficial owners are individuals and the Units are not held through a partnership in Singapore or Qualifying Unitholders, who are not acting in the capacity of a trustee, the Trustee and the Manager will make the distributions to such Unitholders without deducting any income tax; and  
- where the beneficial owners are Qualifying foreign non-individual investors or qualifying Non-resident Fund or where the Units are held by nominee Unitholders who can demonstrate that the Units are held for beneficial owners who are Qualifying foreign non-individual investors or qualifying Non-resident Fund, the Trustee and the Manager will deduct/withhold tax at a reduced rate of  $10\%$  from the distributions.

A Qualifying foreign non-individual investor refers to a non-resident non-individual unitholder or foreign fund who:

(i) does not have any permanent establishment in Singapore (other than a fund manager in Singapore); or  
(ii) carries on any operation through a permanent establishment in Singapore (other than a fund manager in Singapore), where the funds used by that person to acquire the units in the Trust are not obtained from that operation.

A Qualifying Unitholder is a unitholder who is:

(i) an individual (including those who purchased units in the Trust through agent banks or Supplementary Retirement Scheme ("SRS") operators which act as a nominee under the CPF Investment Scheme or the SRS respectively);  
(ii) a company incorporated and resident in Singapore;  
(iii) a Singapore branch of a foreign company;  
(iv) a body of persons (excluding companies or partnerships) incorporated or registered in Singapore, including charities registered under Charities Act 1994 or established by any written law, town councils, statutory boards, co-operative societies registered under the Co-operatives Societies Act 1979 or trade unions registered under the Trade Unions Act 1940;

# 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)

# 3.15 Taxation (cont'd)

# Tax transparency (cont'd)

(v) an international organisation that is exempt from tax on such distributions by reason of an order made under the International Organisations (Immunities and Privileges) Act 1948; or  
(vi) real estate investment trust exchange-traded funds ("REIT ETFs") which have been accorded the tax transparency treatment.

A qualifying Non-resident Fund is a non-resident fund that qualifies for tax exemption under Section 13D, 13U or 13V of the Income Tax Act 1947 and who:

(i) does not have a permanent establishment in Singapore (other than a fund manager in Singapore); or  
(ii) carries on an operation through a permanent establishment in Singapore (other than a fund manager in Singapore), where the funds used by that qualifying fund to acquire units of the Trust are not obtained from that operation.

The above tax transparency ruling does not apply to gains from the sale of real properties. Such gains, when determined by the IRAS to be trading gains, are assessable to tax on the Trustee. Where the gains are capital gains, the Trustee will not be assessed to tax and may distribute the capital gains without tax being deducted at source.

# 3.16 Unitholders' funds

Unitholders' funds represent the Unitholders' residual interest in the Group's net assets upon termination and are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of Units are deducted against unitholders' funds.

# 3.17 Government grants

Government grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and the Group will comply with the conditions associated with the grant. Government grants related to income are recognised in the statement of total return as 'other income' on a systematic basis over the periods in which the entity recognises as expenses the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate.

# 3.18 Non-Current Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale

Non-current assets and liabilities, that are highly probable to be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use, are classified as held for sale. Immediately before classification as held for sale, the assets are remeasured in accordance with the applicable FRS. Thereafter, the assets are generally measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Impairment losses on initial classification as held for sale and subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised in the statement of total return. Gains are not recognised in excess of any cumulative impairment loss.

Property, plant and equipment once classified as held for sale are not depreciated. In addition, equity accounting of associate and joint ventures ceases once the investments are classified as held for sale.

# Valuation processes

Investment properties, including investment property reclassified as assets held for sale, are stated at fair value based on valuations performed by external independent valuers who possess appropriate recognised professional qualifications and relevant experience in the location and category of the investment properties being valued. In accordance with the CIS code, the Group rotates the independent valuers every two years.

In determining the fair value, the valuers have used valuation methods which involve certain estimates. The key assumptions used to determine the fair value of investment properties, including investment property reclassified as assets held for sale, include market-corroborated capitalisation yields, discount rates and terminal yields. The Manager reviews the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies, assumptions and estimates adopted and is of the view that they are reflective of the market conditions as at 30 September 2023.

The fair value measurement for investment properties, including investment property reclassified as assets held for sale, for the Group and Trust have been categorised as Level 3 fair values based on the inputs to the valuation techniques used.

Valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs

The following table shows the valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used in measuring level 3 fair values of investment properties, including investment property reclassified as assets held for sale:

<table><tr><td>Valuation techniques</td><td>Significant unobservable inputs</td><td>Range of unobservable inputs</td><td>Relationship of unobservable inputs to fair value</td></tr><tr><td>Capitalisation approach</td><td>Capitalisation rate</td><td>3.75% – 5.00% 
(2022: 3.75% – 5.00%)</td><td>The higher the rates, the lower the fair value.</td></tr><tr><td>Discounted cash flow analysis</td><td>Discount rate</td><td>6.75% – 7.50% 
(2022: 6.75% – 7.50%)</td><td>The higher the rates, the lower the fair value.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Terminal yield</td><td>4.00% – 5.25% 
(2022: 4.00% – 5.25%)</td><td>The higher the rates, the lower the fair value.</td></tr><tr><td>Direct comparison method (1)</td><td>Transacted prices</td><td>$2,762 – $5,751 psf 
(2022: $2,329 – $4,362 psf)</td><td>The higher the comparable values, the higher the fair value.</td></tr></table>

(1) The direct comparison method was used in the valuation of Yishun 10 Retail Podium.

The significant unobservable inputs correspond to:

discount rate, based on the risk-free rate for 10-year bonds issued by the Government of Singapore, adjusted for a risk premium to reflect the risk of investing in the asset class;  
terminal yield reflects the uncertainty, functional/economic obsolescence and the risk associated with the investment properties; and  
- capitalisation rate which corresponds to a rate of return on investment properties based on the expected income that the property will generate.

H-REIT is a real estate investment trust constituted in Malaysia by a trust deed dated 5 October 2006. H-REIT units are listed on the Main Board of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad. The principal investment objective of H-REIT is to invest in income-producing real estate in Malaysia used primarily for retail purposes.

On 24 December 2021 and 29 December 2021, H-REIT conducted a private placement exercise. Following the private placement, the Group's interest in H-REIT decreased from  $31.15\%$  to  $30.53\%$ . Arising from the dilution of interest in H-REIT, the Group recognised a loss of  $\$1,143,000$  in 2022, of which a loss of  $\$399,000$  arose from the realisation of translation reserve.

On 3 January 2023, H-REIT declared a distribution of RM6,864,000 (net of  $10\%$  withholding tax) to the Group for the fourth quarter ended 31 December 2022, based on 5.3 sen per unit. The Group had elected to reinvest the entire distribution under the IDRP based on the issue price of RM0.65 per unit. Following the IDRP, the Group received 10,559,928 new H-REIT units and the Group's interest in H-REIT increased from  $30.53\%$  to  $30.97\%$ .

On 22 September 2023, the Trust entered into a sale and purchase agreement with an unrelated third party in relation to the divestment of  $28.85\%$  interest in H-REIT, comprising of 143,898,398 units in H-REIT for a purchase consideration of approximately RM128,070,000 (equivalent to approximately $37,319,000). The purchase consideration was negotiated on a willing-buyer and willing-seller basis at RM0.89 per unit.

On 4 October 2023, the Trust entered into a sale and purchase agreement with an unrelated third party in relation to the divestment of the remaining  $2.12\%$  interest in H-REIT, comprising 10,559,928 units in H-REIT for a purchase consideration of approximately RM6,864,000 (equivalent to approximately $2,000,000). The purchase consideration was negotiated on a willing-buyer and willing-seller basis at RM0.65 per unit.

The Group and the Trust provided for an impairment loss of  $3,982,000 (2022:$ NIL) and $7,330,000 (2022: $1,929,000) respectively to write down the carrying amount of the investment in H-REIT to the estimated recoverable amount. The entire interest in H-REIT was reclassified to assets held for sale (Note 12) as at 30 September 2023 and the divestments are expected to be completed in the quarter ending 31 December 2023.

As the results of H-REIT were not expected to be announced in sufficient time to be included in the Group's results for the quarter ended 30 September 2022, the Group had estimated the results of H-REIT for the quarter ended 30 September 2022 based on its results for the preceding quarter, adjusted for significant transactions and events occurring up to the reporting date of the Group, if any.

The results for H-REIT are equity accounted for at the Group level, net of  $10\%$  (2022:  $10\%$ ) withholding tax in Malaysia.

The fair value of H-REIT based on published price quotations was \(23,620,000 as at 30 September 2022.

With effect from 14 August 2013, the maximum aggregate principal amount of notes that may be issued under the FCT MTN Programme was increased from $500 million to $1 billion. Under the FCT MTN Programme, FCT MTN may, subject to compliance with all relevant laws, regulations and directives, from time to time issue notes (the "Notes") in Singapore dollars or any other currency. The Notes may be issued in various amounts and tenors, and may bear interest at fixed, floating, hybrid or variable rates of interest. Hybrid notes or zero-coupon notes may also be issued under the FCT MTN Programme.

The Notes shall constitute direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of FCT MTN ranking pari passu, without any preference or priority among themselves, and pari passu with all other present and future unsecured obligations (other than subordinated obligations and priorities created by law) of FCT MTN. All sums payable in respect of the Notes are unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by the Trustee.

As at 30 September 2023,  $70 million (2022:$ 70 million) of Fixed Rate Notes issued by the Group under the FCT MTN Programme mature in November 2024 and bear a fixed interest rate of  $2.770\%$  per annum payable semi-annually in arrears.

# Multicurrency Debt (unsecured) Issuance Programme

On 8 February 2017, the Group established a $3 billion Multicurrency Debt Issuance Programme ("Debt Issuance Programme").

Each series or tranche of Notes may be issued in various amounts and tenors, and may bear interest at fixed, floating, hybrid or variable rates as may be agreed between the relevant dealers of the Debt Issuance Programme and the relevant Issuer or may not bear interest. The Notes and the coupons of all series shall constitute direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the relevant Issuer and shall at all times rank pari passu, without any preference or priority among themselves, and pari passu with all other present and future unsecured obligations (other than subordinated obligations and priorities created by law) of the relevant Issuer.

# 26. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

# (a) Capital risk management

The primary objective of the Group's capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong and healthy capital structure in order to support its business and maximise Unitholder value.

The Group is subject to the aggregate leverage limit as defined in the Property Fund Guidelines of the CIS Code. The CIS Code stipulates that borrowings and deferred payments (together the "Aggregate Leverage") of a property fund should not exceed  $45.0\%$  of the fund's deposited property. The aggregate leverage of a property fund may exceed  $45.0\%$  of the fund's deposited property (up to a maximum of  $50.0\%$ ) only if the property fund has a minimum adjusted interest coverage ratio of 2.5 times after taking into account the interest payment obligations arising from the new borrowings.

As at 30 September 2023, the Group's Aggregate Leverage stood at  $39.3\%$  (2022:  $33.0\%$ ) of its deposited property, which is within the limit set by the Property Fund Guidelines and externally imposed capital requirements. The Trust has affirmed its corporate ratings of "BBB" from S&P Global Ratings and "Baa2" from Moody's Investors Service.

# (b) Financial risk management objectives and policies

Exposure to credit, foreign currency, interest rate and liquidity risks arises in the normal course of the Group's business. The Manager continually monitors the Group's exposure to the above risks. There has been no change to the Group's exposure to these financial risks or the manner in which it manages and measures risks.

# (i) Credit risk

Credit risk is the potential financial loss resulting from the failure of a customer or counterparty to settle its financial and contractual obligations to the Group as and when they fall due.

The Group's objective is to seek continual revenue growth while minimising losses incurred due to increased credit risk exposure. The Manager has established credit limits for tenants and monitors their balances on an ongoing basis. Credit evaluations are performed by the Manager before lease agreements are entered into with tenants. Credit risk is also mitigated by the security deposits held for each of the tenants. In addition, receivables are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group's exposure to bad debts is not significant.

# Trade receivables

The Manager has established an allowance account for doubtful receivables that represents its estimate of losses in respect of trade receivables due from specific customers. Subsequently when the Group is satisfied that no recovery of such losses is possible, the financial asset is considered irrecoverable and the amount charged to the allowance account is written off against the carrying amount of the impaired financial asset.

The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of each financial asset on the statements of financial position. At the reporting date, approximately  $14.9\%$  (2022:  $26.2\%$ ) of the Group's trade receivables were due from 5 tenants which are reputable companies located in Singapore.

(i) Credit risk (cont'd)

# Expected credit loss assessment for individual tenants

The Group uses an allowance matrix to measure the ECLs of trade receivables from individual tenants, which comprise a very large number of tenants.

Loss rates are calculated using a 'roll rate' method based on the probability of a receivable progressing through successive stages of delinquency to write-off based on actual credit loss experience over the last three years.

The following table provides information about the exposure to credit risk and ECLs for trade receivables at the reporting date:

The movement in the allowance for doubtful receivables during the financial year was as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">Group</td><td colspan="2">Trust</td></tr><tr><td>2023$&#x27;000</td><td>2022$&#x27;000</td><td>2023$&#x27;000</td><td>2022$&#x27;000</td></tr><tr><td>At beginning</td><td>154</td><td>942</td><td>111</td><td>751</td></tr><tr><td>Net allowance/(written back) for doubtful receivables</td><td>51</td><td>(656)</td><td>(17)</td><td>(640)</td></tr><tr><td>Write-off of trade receivables against allowance</td><td>(62)</td><td>(132)</td><td>(15)</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>At end</td><td>143</td><td>154</td><td>79</td><td>111</td></tr></table>

Trade receivables that are individually determined to be impaired at the reporting date relate to debtors that are in significant difficulties and have defaulted on payments. The allowance for doubtful receivables recorded in relation to these receivables represents the amount in excess of the security deposits held as collateral.

Based on the Group's historical experience of the collection of trade receivables, the Manager believes that there is no additional credit risk beyond those which have been provided for.

# (b) Financial risk management objectives and policies (cont'd)

(i) Credit risk (cont'd)

# Deposits and other receivables

Impairment on these balances has been measured on the 12-month expected loss basis which reflects the short maturity and low credit risks of the exposure. The amount of the allowance on these balances is insignificant.

# Amounts due from related parties and subsidiaries

Outstanding balances with related parties are unsecured and repayable on demand. ECL is assessed from estimated cash flows recoverable from the related parties and subsidiaries based on the review of their financial strength at the reporting date. There is no allowance for doubtful receivables arising from these outstanding balances as the ECL is not material.

# Cash and cash equivalents

Cash is placed with financial institutions which are regulated. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value on the statements of financial position. Impairment on cash and cash equivalents has been measured on the 12-month expected loss basis and reflects the short maturities of the exposure. The Group considers that its cash and cash equivalents have low credit risk based on the external credit ratings of the counterparties. The amount of the allowance on cash and cash equivalents was negligible.

(ii) Currency risk

The Group's foreign currency risk relates mainly to the borrowings, that are denominated in Australian dollars ("A$").

The Manager monitors the Group's foreign currency exposure on an ongoing basis and limits its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by using derivative financial instruments or other suitable financial products, where appropriate.

The Group uses cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge its currency risk. The Group determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based on the currency and amount of their respective cash flows.

The Group assesses whether the derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be and has been effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item using the critical terms match method and hypothetical derivative method.

During the financial year, the Group has drawn down borrowings of A$238.1 million (equivalent to $209.2 million) (2022: Nil) and entered into cross-currency interest rate swaps to fully hedge against the foreign currency risk, and accordingly, there is no net currency exposure arising from these borrowings.

# (b) Financial risk management objectives and policies (cont'd)

(iii) Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of the Group's financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group's exposure to interest rate risk is in respect of debt obligations with financial institutions.

The Group manages its interest rate exposure by maintaining a mix of fixed and floating rate debts with varying tenors. The Group actively reviews its debt portfolio, taking into account the investment holding period and nature of its assets. To manage this mix in a cost-efficient manner, the Group uses hedging instruments such as interest rate swaps and and cross-currency interest rate swaps to minimise its exposure to interest rate volatility.

The Group determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based on the reference interest rates, tenors, repricing dates and maturities and the notional or par amounts.

The Group assesses whether the derivative designated in each hedge relationship is expected to be effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item using the critical terms method, dollar offset method or regression method.

Hedge ineffectiveness may occur due to changes in the critical terms of either the interest rate swaps or borrowings.

# Managing interest rate benchmark reform and associated risks

A fundamental reform of major interest rate benchmarks is being undertaken globally, including the replacement of some interbank offered rates ("IBORs") with alternative nearly risk-free rates (referred to as "interest rate benchmark reform"). The Group had exposures to IBORs (i.e. SOR) on its financial instruments that will be replaced or reformed as part of these market-wide initiatives.

The Group monitors and manages the transition to alternative rates. The Group evaluates the extent to which contracts reference SOR cash flows, whether such contracts will need to be amended as a result of interest rate benchmark reform and how to manage communication about interest rate benchmark reform with counterparties.

The Group monitors the progress of transition from SOR to SORA by reviewing the total amounts of contracts that have yet to transition to SORA and the amounts of such contracts that include an appropriate fallback clause. The Group considers that a contract is not yet transitioned to SORA when interest under the contract is indexed to SOR, even if it includes a fallback clause that deals with the cessation of the existing SOR (referred to as an "unreformed contract").

# Non-derivative financial liabilities

Historically, the Group's IBOR exposures to non-derivative financial liabilities included secured and unsecured bank loans indexed to SOR. As at 30 September 2023, the Group is no longer exposed to any interest rate risk arising from the IBOR reform.

As at 30 September 2022, the carrying amounts of unreformed non-derivative financial liabilities of the Group and Trust were  $372,364,000 and$ 118,782,000, respectively.

(iii) Interest rate risk (cont'd)

# Derivatives

The Group holds interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps for risk management purposes that are designated in cash flow hedging relationships. The Group's derivative instruments are governed by contracts based on the International Swaps and Derivatives Association ("ISDA")'s master agreements.

As at 30 September 2023, the Group has completed the transition with respective counterparties of the contracts for all derivative financial instruments and is no longer exposed to any interest rate risk arising from the IBOR reform. As at 30 September 2022, the notional amounts of unreformed derivative financial instruments that included appropriate fallback language of the Group and Trust were  $310,000,000 and$ 119,000,000 respectively.

# Hedge accounting

The Group's hedged items and hedging instruments at the reporting date are indexed to SORA.

Hedging relationships impacted by interest rate benchmark reform may experience ineffectiveness attributable to market participants' expectations of when the shift from the existing IBOR benchmark rate to an alternative benchmark interest rate will occur for the relevant hedged items and hedging instruments.

During the financial year, the Group has fully completed the IBOR reform transition for the remaining IBOR linked instruments. The Group has applied the Phase 2 amendments relief when the relief criterions are met:

(i) The Group updates the effective interest rate of the financial liability carried at amortised cost with no immediate gain or loss to be recognised.  
(ii) The Group amends the formal hedge documentation by the end of reporting period for changes which are required by IBOR reform to the hedged risk, hedged items and hedging instrument. Amendments to the formal hedge documentation do not constitute discontinuation of the hedging relationship.

For the year ended 30 September 2023, the IBOR reform transition of the affected financial liabilities at amortised cost and interest rate swaps had no material ineffectiveness on the consolidated financial statements of the Group. Given that most of the critical terms were matched, the changes in fair value of the hedged risk approximates the change in fair value of the hedging instruments. Therefore, no material ineffectiveness was recognised.

Sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk

It is estimated that every 100 basis points increase in interest rate at the reporting date, with all other variables held constant, would increase the Group's Unitholders' funds by approximately  $22,237,000 (2022:$ 12,924,000) and every 100 basis points decrease in interest rate, with all other variables held constant, would decrease the Group's Unitholders' funds by approximately $22,796,000 (2022: $13,341,000), arising mainly as a result of change in the fair value of interest rate swap instruments.

On outstanding borrowings not covered by derivative financial instruments at the reporting date, it is estimated that every 100 basis points increase in interest rate, with all other variables held constant, would decrease the Group's total return for the year by approximately  $8,181,000 (2022:$ 5,300,000) and every 100 basis points decrease in interest rate, with all other variables held constant, would increase the Group's total return for the year by approximately  $8,181,000 (2022:$ 5,300,000), arising mainly as a result of higher/ lower interest expense on floating rate loans and borrowings. The assumed movement in basis points for interest rate sensitivity analysis is based on current observable market environment.
