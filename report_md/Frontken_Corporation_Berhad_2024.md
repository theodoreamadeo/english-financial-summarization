# Dear Shareholders,

Welcome to our Annual Report 2024.

On behalf of the Board of Directors, I am pleased to present to you the Annual Report and Audited Financial Statements of the Frontken's group (the "Group") for the financial year 2024 ("FY2024"). As part of this Annual Report, we have also included the Management Discussion and Analysis to provide our shareholders with a more insightful and informative details of the Group's operation and performance.

I am pleased to report that for FY2024 Frontken managed to deliver a strong set of numbers despite a dynamic and challenging global landscape. Our commitment to excellence has enabled us to achieve robust financial results and at the same time further strengthened our position in the industry.

# MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

# A YEAR OF GROWTH

# Financial performance

In FY2024, we achieved a record revenue of RM569.2 million, marking a  $14\%$  increase from the previous year. Our net income rose by  $22\%$  to RM136.8 million, resulting in an improved profit margin of  $24\%$ , up from  $22\%$  in FY2023. The improved bottom line was attributable to the Group's higher revenue, prudent cost management and continual enhancement of processes leading to better production efficiency.

In recognition of our strong performance and commitment to delivering shareholders value, the Board declared a second single tier dividend of 2.0 sen per share for FY2024. The entitlement and payment dates were set for 27 March 2025 and 21 April 2025 respectively. This brings the total dividend payment of 3.7 sen per share for the whole year and total payout amounting to approximately RM58.6 million, representing  $43\%$  of the Group's total net earnings. The Board is committed to maintaining a sustainable dividend payment after taking into account its other business obligations.

During the year, the Group continued to generate a positive cash flow of RM166.6 million from its business operations. The Group's capital expenditure ("CAPEX") for the year for property, plant and equipment was at RM24.8 million. Despite the additional cash outflows from dividend and CAPEX, the Group's total cash balance as at 31 December 2024 remained strong at RM514.9 million.

# CHAIRMAN'SMESSAGE (CONT'D)

# OVERALL 2024

2024 has been a year of significant achievements for Frontken, marked by record financial performance and growth across both our business segments. Our unwavering focus on operational excellence, strategic investments and responsiveness to market demands has allowed us to strengthen our position as a leading service provider in the industries we serve.

Our subsidiary in Taiwan, which serves the semiconductor industry, played a crucial role in driving our growth. The increasing complexity of semiconductor manufacturing and the rising need for electronics have led to higher demand for our services. We successfully expanded our capacity and optimised our operations to support our customers' growing requirements, reinforcing our position as a trusted partner in the industry. Similarly, our operations in Singapore and Malaysia continued to contribute positively, benefiting from continued demand in the semiconductor sector.

Innovation and R&D remained a core focus throughout the year. We continued to invest in automation, process improvements and new technologies to enhance our service offerings and improve operational efficiency. Our ongoing efforts in sustainability and environmental responsibility also continued, aligning with our customers' increasing emphasis on green production and cleaner processes.

In addition to our semiconductor business, our engineering division continued to deliver steady performance. The recovery of the oil and gas ("O&G") sector and increased repair and maintenance activities in key markets had provided us with opportunities for growth. We leveraged our expertise in the precision engineering space and specialty proprietary coatings to serve our customers across the O&G, energy and other general industries.

That said, 2024 was not without its challenges. Global economic uncertainties, inflationary pressures and geopolitical tensions created a volatile business environment. Additionally, supply chain disruptions and rising costs posed hurdles, requiring us to take proactive measures to maintain operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Despite these challenges, our ability to adapt and our commitment to innovation enabled us to navigate the challenges effectively.

# OUR WORKFORCE

During the year, we continued to invest in training and development to empower our workforce, equipping them with the skills and knowledge to excel in an ever-evolving industry. Through various learning programmes, workshops and leadership development initiatives, we continued to foster a culture of growth, innovation and excellence. We have always believed that when our people are well trained, they not only produce higher quality results the first-time round, but also the process of self-improvement keeps them motivated and better able to take on their daily challenges. Apart from providing development and growth opportunities, we believe that it is vital to ensure that all our employees are compensated fairly for their skills and commitment. We continued to monitor and make the necessary adjustments to our employees' compensation so that they are at least in line with the industry standards. This includes having a compensation package that reflect their achievements based on meeting key performance indicators in both qualitative and quantitative measures.

# ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCE ("ESG") AND SUSTAINABILITY

We recognise that good ESG practices are essential for sustainable business growth and risk management. ESG is not just a compliance requirement but it is a fundamental part of our growth strategy. Over the years, we have been progressively incorporating ESG considerations into our operations, particularly in our environmental initiatives, employee welfare and corporate governance practices. We believe that this is important to us as it aligns with the Group's long-term sustainability strategy, operational resilience and corporate responsibility.

Environmental - We acknowledge the importance of reducing our carbon footprint. To that end, we have implemented various energy efficient processes and waste management strategies to minimise our environmental impact. During the year, we continue to measure and reduce greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions associated with our operation. We strive to minimise energy consumption in our workplace and at the same time improve on our operational performance in the areas of GHG emissions and energy, waste and water usage. In 2024, through our efforts and continued collaboration with our customers, since 2018, we have adopted the equivalent of 4.7 million KW of electricity using solar energy, an accumulative savings of 492.7 thousand tonnes of recycled DI-Water and accumulative savings of 462.5 thousand kg of recycled waste in our operations. Our goal is to implement energy-efficient processes and reducing carbon emissions across all facilities. The long-term target is to reduce our Emissions Intensity which is to stabilise emissions with the aim to achieve Net Zero Emissions by 2050.

# CHAIRMAN'SMESSAGE CONT'D)

Social – We believe that the social aspect of ESG begins within our own organisation. Our employees are at the heart of our operations and we are committed to treating them with fairness, respect, and dignity. Over the years, we have upheld a strong track record in both health and safety and enforced a zero-tolerance policy against all forms of forced labour; resulting in a workplace that values equal opportunities. We actively encourage continuous learning and development while implementing key policies such as diversity and inclusion, among others. To safeguard our workforce, we conduct risk assessments, implement protective measures and establish mitigation plans to manage potential hazards. We firmly believe that fostering a positive work environment and high employee morale will translate into enhanced productivity. In 2024, we achieved an employee retention rate of  $98.2\%$ , surpassing our internal target by  $3\%$ .

Through our Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives, we continued to make a positive impact on the communities we serve. We extended support to those in need, both financially and emotionally by offering meaningful opportunities that empower individuals. Our initiatives include providing internships to students from local/various universities and offering employment opportunities to individuals with health conditions and physical challenges. We believe that by addressing specific needs, we can help rebuild confidence and promote self-sufficiency, ultimately contributing to a more inclusive society.

Governance – The Board remains steadfast in upholding the principles outlined in the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance, ensuring that ethical business practices and transparency remain at the core of our operations. We are committed to fostering strong and effective relationships with stakeholders while safeguarding the rights and interests of our shareholders. In line with this commitment, we have established a robust governance framework that includes various policies and best practices aligned with our corporate values and long-term sustainability objectives.

Beyond our internal governance measures, we extended our commitment to ethical business practices by engaging proactively with suppliers, customers, and key stakeholders to uphold ESG principles. Our adherence to responsible selling practices and fair procurement policies ensures transparency, competitiveness and ethical decision-making throughout our supply chain. Separately, we also actively engaged with our institutional shareholders through regular dialogues and participation in investor briefings to ensure open communication and transparency. Additionally, we have established a dedicated shareholder platform on our corporate website, enabling investors to seek clarifications and stay informed about our governance and business developments.

For further insights into our governance framework, the Corporate Governance Overview Statement is available on page 33 of this Annual Report. Additional governance-related policies and reports can also be accessed on our website at www.frontken.com.

Commitment to Sustainability Goal - In driving our sustainability agenda, we benchmark our progress against internationally recognised frameworks, including the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Framework, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Framework and the Bursa Malaysia FTSE Russell ESG Model Framework. For example, our commitment to responsible business practices is reflected in our alignment with 12 out of the 17 UN SDGs, with a continued focus on expanding our contributions towards achieving the global objectives. We hope to further align with these frameworks and make meaningful progress toward a more sustainable and responsible future.

Further details on the Group's Sustainability initiatives and achievements for FY2024 are available at the Sustainability section of this Annual Report and the full report on our website at www.frontken.com.

# Semiconductor

The global semiconductor industry experienced a record-breaking year in 2024, with total sales reaching US\(627.6 billion, marking a \(19.1\%\) increase from US\)526.8 billion in 2023, as reported by the Semiconductor Industry Association ("SIA"). According to SIA President and CEO John Neuffer, this milestone represents the industry's highest-ever annual sales, surpassing the US\)600 billion mark for the first time, with double-digit growth projected for 2025. Semiconductors remain the foundation of modern technology, powering innovations in AI, generative AI, communications, medical devices, advanced transportation and defence applications<sup>1</sup>.

For the Group, we witnessed a similar trend with our semiconductor business achieving solid year-on-year growth. Throughout the year, our R&D team worked closely with customers to support their advancements in leading-edge semiconductor technology. As chip evolves to smaller technology nodes, demand for high-precision chamber process parts cleaning has become increasingly stringent, making near-zero particle contamination more critical than ever. Therefore, ensuring the highest quality standards is crucial. We continued to enhance quality control through advanced metrology systems and automated data analytics to maintain exceptional process reliability.

At the same time, we are continuously exploring new innovations and enhance existing processes, including in the area of ESG, where we integrate more environmentally friendly materials and automate some key steps of our operations. The advanced precision cleaning process is intricate, involving 50 - 60 meticulous steps for each component. As always, our processes continue to evolve to keep up with our customers' demand. To improve productivity and cost-effectiveness, we made incremental improvement in our workflows, leading to higher efficiency and optimised performance. Additionally, we collaborate with customers in their innovation journeys, applying new methodologies and developing customised solutions to support their technological roadmaps.

The Group has built a strong presence in major semiconductor markets including Taiwan, Singapore, and Malaysia. Moving forward, we will continue to strengthen our position in these markets by expanding capacity organically to meet the rising demand. Simultaneously, we remain committed to investing in R&D, particularly in automation and advanced cleaning technologies, to further enhance throughput and efficiency.

As we strive to become the global leading service provider in semiconductor surface treatment/precision cleaning, we have to explore new strategic markets. The United States, a key semiconductor innovation hub, presents a compelling opportunity as major semiconductor companies scale up their manufacturing capacities there. Similarly, Europe's semiconductor sector is also evolving rapidly under the European Chips Act, making it an attractive market for our services. Japan, home to some of the largest chip manufacturers, remains another key region for expansion. To that end, we are actively pursuing opportunities with strategic partners for potential collaboration in the markets where we do not yet have a physical presence. Should these discussions materialise, it will provide direct access to these new markets and thus strengthen our global footprint. We will continue to keep our shareholders updated on these developments through official company announcements.

# CHAIRMAN'SMESSAGE (CONT'D)

Taiwan – In FY2024, AGTC achieved a revenue of RM383.4 million, reflecting a strong  $17\%$  year-on-year growth. This performance was primarily driven by the recovery in demand and the production ramp-up of our key semiconductor customers. The semiconductor market experienced a resurgence in 2024, with investments in advanced node manufacturing and capacity expansions. AGTC played a crucial role in supporting this growth by providing high-precision cleaning services and specialty coating essential for semiconductor manufacturing equipment.

Throughout the year, we made significant operational advancements across both of our Taiwan facilities, focusing on process optimisation, automation, and quality enhancement. These improvements have reinforced AGTC's leadership in high-precision cleaning services, ensuring that we continue to meet the stringent cleanliness and performance requirements demanded by next-generation semiconductor technologies. To further support customer expansion plans and meet the growing demand, in March 2025 AGTC acquired a new 3,800 sqm plot of land (Plant 3), near its existing Plant 1, for approximately RM23.0 million. The management is in the planning stage for this proposed new state of the art facility. With this new facility, we will be able to better support our customer with its latest technology nodes.

In 2024, AGTC also achieved an important milestone by celebrating its 25th anniversary. We also took the opportunity to acknowledge and reward quite a number of our colleagues that have been with us for the last 25 years. Their unwavering commitment and contributions have been instrumental in our success and we look forward to building a stronger future together as we continue expanding AGTC's capabilities and reinforcing its position as a key player in the semiconductor ecosystem.

Frontken Singapore (Semicon) - In FY2024, our semiconductor division in Singapore recorded low double-digit growth, supported by a gradual recovery in customer demand and a price adjustment exercise implemented during the year. To counter rising operational costs, we successfully renegotiated contracts to realign pricing for specific parts, ensuring a more sustainable cost structure. This initiative, coupled with efficiency enhancements, contributed to an overall improvement in profitability.

Despite these positive developments, we continue to face challenges, particularly in managing rising labour and material costs, as well as a tightening talent pool. The competitive labour market in Singapore remains a key concern, as recruiting and retaining skilled professionals in the semiconductor sector is increasingly difficult. To mitigate these risks, we focused on workforce optimisation by streamlining our teams, implementing automation in key processes and continuously improving operational efficiency to enhance margins.

Looking ahead, preliminary feedback from our customers suggests optimism for 2025, with expectations of higher fab utilisation rates and increased order volumes. The anticipated ramp-up in customer production activity in Singapore is expected to support our business growth and in delivering a better performance.

Frontken Malaysia ("FMSB") – FMSB oversees precision cleaning operations across Kulim, Melaka, and Kuching. FY2024 was challenging, particularly for our Kulim facility, which experienced a fire incident in May 2024. Although the fire was swiftly contained and no employees were injured, operations were disrupted. However, thanks to our strategic emergency response plan, we promptly redirected orders to our backup facilities in Kuching and Singapore to ensure minimal disruption to our customers.

While this resulted in some operational inconvenience, our proactive measures enabled us to retain all customer accounts and fulfill orders without major delays, demonstrating our resilience and strong customer commitment. However, the additional costs associated with this incident, including shipping, handling, and operational adjustments, placed pressure on our profit margins, leading to a decline in overall profitability. While a net insurance claim of RM2.2 million during the year helped offset some repair costs and loss of profits, it did not fully cover the broader financial impact. Thankfully, the facility was fully operational by October.

We anticipate a steady recovery as our customers continue their expansion plans. The growth is expected to be driven by mass production of wide bandgap technology from our customer's third wafer fab. Additionally, our ongoing collaborations with contract and equipment manufacturers are expected to further bolster our business.

# SUSTAINABILITY REPORT (CONT'D)

In the fiscal year 2024 ("FY2024"), our journey was marked by considerable challenges. Firstly, the global economy is experiencing fluctuations, with concerns about inflation, potential recessions, and varying interest rates. Secondly, the ongoing disruptions in supply chains, exacerbated by geopolitical tensions and natural disasters, continue to impact businesses. Thirdly, the labour market remains tight, making it challenging for businesses to attract and retain top talent. Fourthly, navigating complex and evolving regulations regulatory compliance can be challenging, especially for businesses operating in multiple regions. In addition, businesses are increasingly expected to adopt sustainable practices and address climate change, which requires significant investment and innovation. The world collectively navigated through a global supply chain disruption, prolonged conflicts, diverse natural disasters, and heightened political tensions, alongside grappling with challenges such as high inflation and economic slowdown. While these challenges may seem daunting, they also present opportunities for innovation, growth, and positive change. Frontken Group has been adapting and responding proactively to these challenges to better position for success.

As we adapt to the new realities forged by these challenges, our concerns now encompass critical issues like responsible innovation, climate change, environmental conservation, and prosperity. It is evident that the global business community needs a profound industrial transformation, fostering collaboration, and making necessary adjustments to navigate these complexities. Therefore, responding with heightened innovation, embracing responsible technology, adopting sustainable business operations, mitigating carbon emissions, and transitioning to sustainable energy sources are imperative steps.

Our commitment is to contribute to this transformational journey, fostering responsible practices and making a positive impact on the world stage.

During the fiscal year 2024 meetings of the Sustainability Committee, members engaged in ongoing discussions to enhance our specific business materiality assessment, refine enterprise risk management processes, and strengthen internal control systems. These endeavours are part of our commitment to fine-tune sustainability development priorities and management strategies in response to the evolving risk landscape and challenges confronting our employees, customers and stakeholders.

A notable aspect of our deliberations involved exploring the incorporation of circular economy principles into our business models. This includes a comprehensive consideration of life cycle impacts in the markets we serve. The group recognises the importance of aligning our operations with sustainability principles and strives to implement circular economy concepts that promote resource efficiency, reduce waste, and contribute to a more sustainable future.

These accomplishments underscore our ongoing commitment to driving positive change and creating value for all stakeholders. By prioritising innovation, sustainability, and transparency, we are positioned to contribute meaningfully to addressing global challenges and building a more resilient and sustainable future.

The role and responsibilities of the Board, which are delineated in the Board Charter is available on the Company's website at www.frontken.com and are summarised as follows:

Oversee the conduct of the Company's business;

This process ensures that the Board membership accurately reflects the long-term strategic direction and needs of the Company and determines the skill matrix to support the strategic direction and needs of the Company.

The Board has, by engaging an independent professional company, PLC & C Sdn Bhd, conducted a Board effectiveness evaluation including questions on Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG") and test on Fit and Proper for Directors standing for re-election at the forthcoming 21st Annual General Meeting ("AGM"), in February 2025 to assess the effectiveness of the Board, Board Committees and Individual Directors. The carefully designed and independently conducted Board evaluation process identified the strengths of the Board as well as areas for improvements. A detailed self-assessment is undertaken to assess the effectiveness of the Board as a whole and the Board Committees as well as the contribution, performance and time commitment of each individual Director. The Board evaluation process was conducted via a set of questionnaires containing both quantitative and open-ended questions, based on self and peer-rating by the Chairman of the Board and respective Chairmen of the Board Committees, and the outcome of the evaluation was tabled in a summary report presented to the NC by a representative of the external expert to the NC for discussion and matters that required attention of the Board were escalated to the Board Meeting for further deliberations and actions.

Based on the evaluation conducted, the NC was satisfied with the existing Board composition and concluded that each Director has the requisite competence and capability to serve on the Board and had sufficiently demonstrated their commitment to the Group in terms of time and participation during the financial year under review and recommended to the Board for the re-election of the retiring Directors at the Company's AGM. All assessments and evaluations carried by the NC in discharge of its functions were duly documented.

The NC has assessed the independence of the three (3) Independent Non-Executive Directors, namely Mr Ng Chee Whye, Ms Koh Huey Min and YM Raja Jastina Adlina Binti Raja Arshad. Following the recommendation of the NC, the Board is of the opinion that the independence of the Independent Non-Executive Directors remained unimpaired and their judgement over business dealings of the Company were not influenced by the interest of the other Directors or substantial shareholders.

The Company has not established a policy for setting targets for gender, ethnic or age composition in the Board. However, the Board believes that more importantly, the suitability of candidates should be evaluated based on the candidates' competency, character, time availability, integrity, and experience in meeting the Company's needs. The Board constantly advocates fair and equal participation and opportunity for all individuals of the right calibre.

# PRINCIPLE B - EFFECTIVE AUDIT AND RISK MANAGEMENT

# I. AUDIT COMMITTEE

To assist in the discharge of its duties on financial reporting, the Board has established an Audit Committee, comprising three (3) Non-Executive Directors, with Mr Ng Chee Whye, an Independent Non-Executive Director, as the Committee Chairman. The Committee's composition, including its roles and responsibilities as well as a summary of its activities carried out during the financial year under review, are set out in the Audit Committee Report on pages 46 to 48 of this Annual Report. One of the key responsibilities of the Audit Committee is to ensure that the financial statements of the Group and Company comply with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and provisions of the Companies Act 2016. Such financial statements comprise the quarterly financial report announced to Bursa Securities and the annual statutory financial statements.

The Board understands its role in upholding the integrity of financial reporting by the Company. Accordingly, the Audit Committee, which assists the Board in this aspect, has adopted a policy for the types of non-audit services permitted to be provided by the external auditors and/or their affiliates, including the need for obtaining the Audit Committee's approval for such services.

To enhance transparency and governance, the Audit Committee has also formalised the Policies and Procedures To Assess The Suitability, Objectivity And Independence Of External Auditors that requires a former audit partner to observe a cooling-off period of at least three (3) years if this person is sought to be appointed as an Audit Committee member. This applies to all partners of the external audit firm and/or its affiliate firm. The cooling off period safeguards the independence of the audit by avoiding the potential threats which may arise when a former partner of the external audit firm is in position to exert significant influence over the audit and preparation of the Company's financial statements.

# STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL

# PURPOSE OF STATEMENT

Paragraph 15.26(b) of the Main Market Listing Requirements of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad ("Bursa Securities") states that a listed issuer must ensure that its Board of Directors issues a statement ("Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control" or "Statement") about the state of risk management and internal control of the listed issuer as a group. The Statement must include adequate and meaningful information to enable shareholders and other stakeholders to make an informed assessment of the main features and adequacy of the listed issuer's risk management and internal control system as a group.

Accordingly, the Board of Directors ("Board") of Frontken Corporation Berhad ("Company") furnishes this Statement, which outlines the nature and scope of the system of risk management and internal control of the Group (comprising the Company and its subsidiaries) for the financial year ended 31 December 2024 and up to the date of approval of this Statement for inclusion in the Company's Annual Report. For purpose of disclosure, this Statement has considered and, where pertinent, including the mandatory contents outlined in the "Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control - Guidelines for Directors of Listed Issuers", a publication of Bursa Securities, which sets out guidance to listed issuers in drafting the Statement.

# BOARD'S RESPONSIBILITY ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL

The Board affirms its overall responsibility for the Group's system of risk management and internal control to safeguard shareholders' investment and the Group's assets as well as review the adequacy, integrity and operating effectiveness of this system in meeting the Group's corporate objectives. The Board is mindful of the need to establish clear roles and responsibilities in discharging its fiduciary and leadership functions in line with the Principles, Practices and Guidance of the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance ("MCCG").

In view of the inherent limitations in any system of risk management and internal control ("System"), the System is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of not adhering to the Group's policies and achieving goals and objectives within the risk tolerance established by the Board and Management. The System can, therefore, only provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against any material misstatement, financial loss or fraud.

The Board has formalised an Enterprise Risk Management framework ("ERM Framework") that encompasses relevant policies and guidelines to streamline the Group's risk management imperatives in a structured and comprehensive manner to safeguard shareholders' investment and the Group's assets. This ERM Framework accords largely with the ISO31000:2018 Risk Management - Guidelines, which set out the key principles, framework and process of risk management. With this ERM Framework, the Board has established an on-going process to identify, evaluate, control, report and monitor significant business risks faced by the Group on an ongoing basis.

The Board, through its Audit Committee, reviews the outcome of this risk management process, including actions taken and mitigating measures implemented by Management to address the key risks as identified. This process has been in place for the financial year under review and up to the date of approval of this Statement for inclusion in the Annual Report of the Company.

# RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK -EXTENT OF COVERAGE

Risk management is embodied in the Group's key business processes through the ERM Framework, which sets out, among others, an easy-to-understand step-by-step approach to identify and evaluate risks faced by business units and, by extension, the Group. To harmonise risk management initiatives and activities, the Board has formalised in writing relevant risk management policies and guidelines for adherence by business units across the Group. The ERM Framework comprises a structured assessment process, culminating in the compilation of specific risk profiles of key business units and companies in the Group by Risk Management Units ("RMUs"), including the semi-annual update of risk profiles to consider the vagaries of evolving business environment as well as emerging risks.

The individual risks are scored for their likelihood of occurrence and the impact thereof based on a '5 by 5' risk matrix, deploying parameters established for each key business unit or company in the Group. The risk parameters comprise relevant financial and non-financial metrics for risks to be evaluated or quantified, as the case may be, in terms of the likelihood of their occurrence and the impact thereof. The use of such metrics essentially articulates the Board's risk appetite, i.e. the extent of risk the Group is prepared to take or seek in achieving its business objectives.

# STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL (CONT'D)

# RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK - EXTENT OF COVERAGE (CONT'D)

Details of specific risks are documented in individual risk registers, covering the risk description, root causes, risk consequences, internal controls implemented by Management to address the root causes, Management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls and the residual risk rating, i.e. the balance of risk after considering the effects of internal controls deployed to manage the exposure. The action plans that Management has taken and/or is taking to mitigate the risks to acceptable levels are reported by the RMUs to the Audit Committee and the outcome is documented in the Audit Committee meeting minutes, including any comments that the Audit Committee may have and such meeting minutes were also presented to the Board. The Audit Committee is tasked to brief the Board on the outcome of the risk update and mitigating measures deployed, including any significant issues therefrom. For each of the business risks identified, a risk owner is entrusted to ensure appropriate actions are taken to mitigate the risk to an acceptable level within specified timeline. The Risk Coordinator of the Group, when reviewing the risk update carried out by business units, enquires into the status of action plans undertaken by the Management of the business units concerned before reporting to the Audit Committee.

During the financial year under review, additional risks identified by the business units together with the actions taken or being taken by Management to mitigate or reduce these additional risks were reported by the Risk Coordinator to the Audit Committee and only those that warranted the attention of the Board were recommended by the Audit Committee to the Board for its deliberation and approval. Whereas matters or decisions made within the purview of the Audit Committee were only escalated to the Board for its information and notation.

# INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM - THE KEY FEATURES

Besides those internal controls implemented by Management to mitigate the risks as mentioned above, the Group's internal control system also covers the following salient elements:

- an organisation structure with clearly defined lines of responsibilities and appropriate levels of delegation and authority, including financial limits of authority in approving transactions and activities as well as mandate to operate bank accounts. This structure also sets out clear reporting lines and segregation of duties for key processes like strategic management, operations, sales and collections, procurement and payment, human resource management, capital expenditure, research and development, financial reporting, corporate affairs and investments;  
- a process of hierarchical reporting which provides a documented and auditable trail of accountability, with appropriate sign-off by personnel entrusted with the responsibilities;  
- an annual budgetary exercise that requires all business units and companies in the Group to formulate financial budgets which are then consolidated into a Group budget, presented to the Board for comments and ultimate approval. Quarterly reviews of the Group's performance against budget are carried out at Board meetings where explanations on significant variances or unusual fluctuations are furnished by Management. Management meetings at the operational level are conducted to review financial performance against business plans and monitor the respective business unit's performance against budget;  
- significant changes in business development are reported by Management to the Board at scheduled meetings. This oversight review enables the Board to evaluate and monitor the Group's business performance vis-à-vis its strategic objectives;  
- the Audit Committee, which is entrusted by the Board to oversee, among others, the Company's financial reporting process, in particular the quarterly and annual announcements of the Group's financial performance, meets at least quarterly to review the announcements, seeks clarification and explanations from Management before recommending the announcements to the Board for approval;  
- internal policies and procedures on key business processes are formalised in writing for application by personnel across the Group. These policies and procedures provide the necessary guidance to personnel on complying with internal control requirements and applicable laws and regulations;  
- structured whistle-blower policies and procedures are formalised in writing to enable employees of the Group to raise genuine concerns about suspected improprieties on matters of financial reporting, non-compliance with laws and regulations, malpractices or unethical business conduct within the Group at the earliest opportunity and in an appropriate way without fear of reprisal. Mr Ng Chee Whye, the Independent Non-Executive Director, with his contact details uploaded to the website of the Company is the person to contact on such concerns; and  
- where issues arise that affect the reliability and integrity of financial information of any business unit, special audits would be commissioned by the Audit Committee or Senior Management, as the case may be to assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities.

# STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL (CONT'D)

# INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION - ITS COMPOSITION AND SCOPE OF COVERAGE

The Group has two (2) groups of internal auditors, i.e. one covering the operations of the Group (save for Taiwan operations), and the other covering solely the Taiwan operations. The internal audit function of the Group (save for Taiwan operations) is outsourced to an independent professional firm, namely Sterling Business Alignment Consulting Sdn Bhd. The internal audit function for the Taiwan operations is an in-house function, i.e. the internal audit personnel are employees of the subsidiary in Taiwan, namely Ares Green Technology Corporation ("AGTC").

The appointment of the outsourced internal audit service provider followed an assessment of its suitability and capability by the Audit Committee of the Company whilst the performance of the in-house internal audit function is under the oversight of AGTC's Board.

# Outsourced internal audit coverage - Group (save for Taiwan operations)

The outsourced internal audit team is helmed by an average of four (4) professionals from the firm, a corporate member of the Institute of Internal Auditor Malaysia. The team, led by Dr So Hsien Ying, a Certified Internal Control Professional, was to conduct an assessment of the Group's system of internal control during the financial year under review, focusing on selected significant business units and reporting its observations, including Management's response and action plans thereto, directly to the Audit Committee. The internal auditor also conducted follow-up reviews on the status of implementation of action plans by Management on the recommendations highlighted, as deemed relevant. The Audit Committee took note of the recommended improvement actions and questions were posed to Management on the timeliness of measures to implement the recommendations as reported.

The internal audit plan for the financial year was prepared based largely on the Group's financial information and the relative risks of the business units to the achievement of the Group's business objectives. This approach deployed aligns with the International Professional Practices Framework of the Institute of Internal Auditors Inc. ("IIA"), which encompasses, inter-alia, the Definition of Internal Auditing, Code of Ethics, Core Principles and International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing, and the IIA Risk Based Internal Auditing Guidance.

For the financial year ended 31 December 2024, Sterling has carried out internal audit reviews of two (2) business units, namely, Frontken (East Malaysia) Sdn Bhd ("FEM") and Frontken (Johor) Sdn Bhd ("FJSB") covering the following areas:-

Procurement and Sourcing;  
Engineering Services and Project Management;  
Billings Process; and  
Safety, Health and Environment.

Sterling also carried out two (2) follow-up status reviews for the financial year to update the Audit Committee on the status of management actions for previously reported audit findings.

At the Audit Committee Meeting in February 2025, Sterling reported that FEM had closed all 12 audit findings and 2 observations during the year under review. For FJSB, 7 out of 17 audit findings remained open and are to be completed by the extended deadline. Sterling will monitor the status in their follow-up reviews throughout the year.

Internal audit tests were carried out by the internal audit function to assess the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the business units' system of internal controls in achieving corporate objectives. Transactions and activities were selected for testing on a sample basis.

Observations on systems weakness and areas for improvement, including recommended mitigating measures to address the concerns raised, were highlighted in the internal audit reports presented to the Audit Committee during the financial year under review.

# STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL (CONT'D)

INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION - ITS COMPOSITION AND SCOPE OF COVERAGE (CONT'D)

In-house internal audit coverage (only Taiwan operations)

The in-house internal auditor, Miss Kelly Huang, who is an accounting graduate, has a working experience of not less than 20 years covering internal audit, external audit and finance function. Independent of the activities she audits, the in-house internal auditor is tasked to assess the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the system of internal control of AGTC, the Company's subsidiary helming the Taiwan operation. In carrying out her work, she adopted the internal audit guidelines from the Regulations Governing Establishment of Internal Control Systems by Public Companies issued by Taiwan Financial Supervisory Commission. The in-house internal auditor has conducted an assessment of AGTC's system of internal control during the financial year under review, focusing on selected significant areas as approved by the Board of AGTC and reported her observations, including Management's response and action plans thereto, directly to the Board of AGTC. The in-house internal auditor also conducted a follow-up on the status of implementation of action plans by Management on the recommendations highlighted in previous reports. The Board of AGTC took note of the issues raised and questions were posed to Management on the timeliness of measures to address the concerns as reported.

The in-house internal audit plan for the financial year under review was prepared based largely on AGTC's financial information and the relative risks to the achievement of AGTC's business objectives. The in-house internal auditor adopted a process life cycle approach in identifying the auditable areas in AGTC. For the financial year ended 31 December 2024, as per the audit plan for year 2024, a review of internal controls on the following key business processes and related controls was carried out:

- Sale and receipt cycle;  
Investment cycle;  
Purchase and payment cycle;  
Finance cycle;  
Labour and wage cycle;  
Management of assets;  
- Functional substitute system;  
Property, plant and equipment cycle;  
Production cycle; and  
Computerised information processing system.

The internal audit plan and a summary of the findings of the in-house internal auditor were shared with the Audit Committee of the Company for information and comments, if any.

For the financial year ended 31 December 2024, the Audit Committee of the Company as well as Board of AGTC reviewed the work of the internal audit functions, outsourced and in-house, as the case may be, their observations and recommendations in order to obtain assurance on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control system. The total cost incurred by the Group for the internal audit functions (both in-house and outsourced) for the financial year under review amounted to approximately RM233,000 (2023: RM244,000).

# External Auditors

The external auditors, in the course of their statutory audit of the Group's financial statements, reviewed the Group's system of internal control to the extent of their planned reliance as laid out in their audit planning memorandum. Any significant deficiencies in internal controls identified during the audit, together with the improvement measures to strengthen internal controls, were reported in writing to the Audit Committee by the external auditors vide their presentation deck.

In assisting the Board to assess the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control system, the Audit Committee reviewed the observations raised by the internal and external auditors, as well as actions taken by Management to address the areas of concern for the financial year ended 31 December 2024. The Audit Committee reported to the Board the outcome of its engagement with the internal and external auditors concerning the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the Group's system of risk management and internal control.

# STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL (CONT'D)

# BOARD'S COMMENTS ON THE ADEQUACY AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF THE GROUP'S RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM

The Board, assisted by its Audit Committee, has reviewed the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control system, and that relevant actions have been or were being taken, as the case may be, to remedy the internal control weaknesses identified from the review.

The Board is of the view that the system of risk management and internal control, in place for the financial year under review and up to the date of approval of this Statement for inclusion in the Annual Report of the Company, is sound and sufficient to safeguard the interest of shareholders, customers, employees and the Group's assets. Whilst the Board is of the view that there was no material losses incurred during the financial year as a result of weaknesses in the risk management and internal control system, the Board believes that this system must continuously evolve to meet the changing business landscape and environment the Group operates in. Therefore, the Board continues to put in place action plans, as deemed appropriate, to strengthen the system of risk management and internal control from time to time towards achieving the Group's corporate objectives.

# ASSURANCE BY THE GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND THE GROUP CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER ON THE ADEQUACY AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM

The Board has received assurance in writing from the Group Chief Executive Officer and the Group Chief Financial Officer stating that the Group's risk management and internal control system operated adequately and effectively, in all material aspects, for the financial year under review and up to the date of this Statement.

Pursuant to Paragraph 15.23 of Bursa Securities' Main Market Listing Requirements, the external auditors have reviewed this Statement for inclusion in the Company's Annual Report for the financial year ended 31 December 2024.

(Incorporated in Malaysia)

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Frontken Corporation Berhad, which comprise the statements of financial position as at 31 December 2024 of the Group and of the Company, and the statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows of the Group and of the Company for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including material accounting policy information, as set out on pages 61 to 133.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and of the Company as at 31 December 2024, and of their financial performance and their cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.

# Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Independence and Other Ethical Responsibilities

We are independent of the Group and of the Company in accordance with the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, Conduct and Practice) of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants ("By-Laws") and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) ("IESBA Code"), as applicable to audits of financial statements of public interest entities and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the By-Laws and the IESBA Code.

# Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.

<table><tr><td>Impairment of Goodwill on ConsolidationRefer to Note 15 to the financial statements.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Key Audit Matter</td><td>How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter</td></tr><tr><td>The Group has goodwill of approximately RM33.8 million comprised within the 3 cash-generating units (&quot;CGU&quot;).For the CGUs which comprised goodwill, the determination of recoverable amount, being the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use, requires judgement on the part of management in identifying and then valuing the relevant CGUs.The value-in-use models used to assess the risk of impairment are based on assumptions including revenue forecasts, gross and operating margins and discount rates, all of which are country-specific.We focused on this area because of the inherent judgement involved in determining key assumptions such as future sales growth, profit margins, discount rates and terminal value.</td><td>Our procedures included, among others:a) Making enquiries of and challenging the management on the key assumptions made, including:i. the achievement of the business plan; andii. sales growth, operating margin, discount rates and long-term growth rates;b) Performing sensitivity analysis on key assumptions and agreeing with management&#x27;s conclusion to ascertain the extent of change that individually, or in combination, would be required for the goodwill to be impaired; andc) Assessing the adequacy of disclosure of goodwill in the financial statements.</td></tr></table>

The total outstanding balances which exceeded the credit term amounted to approximately RM19 million is considered to be of a higher credit risk.The assessment of recoverability of these outstanding receivables involved judgement and estimation of uncertainty by Management.</td><td>Our procedures included, among others:a) Testing the adequacy of the Group&#x27;s allowance for impairment losses on trade receivables by assessing the Group&#x27;s policy and historical data from the Group&#x27;s previous collection experience;b) Reviewing the Group&#x27;s subsequent collection after the financial year for major receivables;c) Reviewing the expected credit loss assessment by challenging whether the historic experience is representative of the current circumstances and of recent losses incurred in the receivables and assessing the reasonableness of forward-looking adjustments; andd) Assessing the adequacy of disclosure in the financial statements.</td></tr></table>

# Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditors' Report Thereon

The directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but does not include the financial statements of the Group and of the Company and our auditors' report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Statements

The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that give a true and fair view in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The directors are also responsible for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

(Incorporated in Malaysia)

# Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.  
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's and the Company's internal control.  
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.  
- Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's or the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.  
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.  
- Plan and perform the group audit to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business units within the group as a basis for forming an opinion on the group financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and review of the audit work performed for purposes of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

The adoption of the above accounting standards and/or interpretations (including the consequential amendments, if any) is expected to have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company upon their initial application except as follows:

MFRS 18 'Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements' will replace MFRS 101 'Presentation of Financial Statements' upon its adoption. This new standard aims to enhance the transparency and comparability of financial information by introducing new disclosure requirements. Specifically, it requires that income and expenses be classified into 3 defined categories: "operating", "investing" and "financing" and introduces 2 new subtotals: "operating profit or loss" and "profit or loss before financing and income tax". In addition, MFRS 18 requires the disclosure of management-defined performance measures and sets out principles for the aggregation and disaggregation of information, which will apply to all primary financial statements and the accompanying notes. The statements of financial position and the statements of cash flows will also be affected. The potential impact of the new standard on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company has yet to be assessed.

# 3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION

# Critical Accounting Estimates And Judgements

Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty

Management believes that there are no key assumptions made concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year other than as disclosed below:

(i) Impairment of Goodwill on Consolidation

The assessment of whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill is allocated. Estimating a value-in-use amount requires management to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. The carrying amount of goodwill on consolidation as at the reporting date and the key assumptions are disclosed in Note 15 to the financial statements.

(ii) Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment and Right-Of-Use Assets

The Group and the Company determine whether an item of its property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets is impaired by evaluating the extent to which the recoverable amount of the asset is less than its carrying amount. This evaluation is subject to changes such as market performance, economic and political situation of the country. A variety of methods is used to determine the recoverable amount, such as valuation reports and discounted cash flows. The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets as at the reporting date are disclosed in Notes 11 and 12 to the financial statements respectively.

# Critical Accounting Estimates And Judgements (Cont'd)

Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty (Cont'd)

(iii) Depreciation of Property, Plant and Equipment

The estimates for the residual values, useful lives and related depreciation charges for the property, plant and equipment are based on commercial factors which could change significantly as a result of technical innovations and competitors' actions in response to the market conditions. The Group and the Company anticipate that the residual values of its property, plant and equipment will be insignificant. As a result, residual values are not being taken into consideration for the computation of the depreciable amount. Changes in the expected level of usage and technological development could impact the economic useful lives and the residual values of these assets, therefore future depreciation charges could be revised. The carrying amount of property, plant and equipment as at the reporting date is disclosed in Note 11 to the financial statements.

(iv) Income Taxes

There are certain transactions and computations for which the ultimate tax determination may be different from the initial estimate. The Group and the Company recognise tax liabilities based on its understanding of the prevailing tax laws and estimates of whether such taxes will be due in the ordinary course of business. Where the final outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recognised, such difference will impact the income tax expense and deferred tax balances in the period in which such determination is made. The carrying amounts of current tax assets and current tax liabilities of the Group and of the Company as at the reporting date are:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">The Group</td><td colspan="2">The Company</td></tr><tr><td>2024 RM</td><td>2023 RM</td><td>2024 RM</td><td>2023 RM</td></tr><tr><td>Current tax assets</td><td>19,617</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Current tax liabilities</td><td>(25,303,110)</td><td>(20,810,377)</td><td>(1,380)</td><td>(17,084)</td></tr></table>

(v) Deferred Tax Assets

Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and unabsorbed capital allowances to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits would be available against which the deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and unabsorbed capital allowances could be utilised. Management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based on the assessment of the probability of the future taxable profits. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets as at the reporting date is disclosed in Note 16 to the financial statements.

(vi) Impairment of Trade Receivables

The Group uses the simplified approach to estimate a lifetime expected credit loss allowance for all trade receivables. The Group develops the expected loss rates based on the payment profiles of past sales and the corresponding historical credit losses, and adjusts for qualitative and quantitative reasonable and supportable forward-looking information. If the expectation is different from the estimation, such difference will impact the carrying value of trade receivables. The carrying amount of trade receivables as at the reporting date is disclosed in Note 14 to the financial statements.

(vii) Write-down of Inventories

Reviews are made periodically by management on damaged, obsolete and slow-moving inventories. These reviews require judgement and estimates. Possible changes in these estimates could result in revisions to the valuation of inventories. The carrying amount of inventories as at the reporting date is disclosed in Note 17 to the financial statements.

(viii) Impairment of Non-Trade Receivables

The loss allowances for non-trade financial assets are based on assumptions about risk of default (probability of default) and expected loss if a default happens (loss given default). It also requires the Group to assess whether there is a significant increase in credit risk of the non-trade financial asset at the reporting date. The Group uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting appropriate inputs to the impairment calculation, based on the past payment trends, existing market conditions and forward-looking information. The carrying amounts of other receivables and amount owing by subsidiaries as at the reporting date are disclosed in Notes 14 and 18 to the financial statements respectively.

Critical Judgements Made in Applying Accounting Policies

Management believes that there are no instances of application of critical judgement in applying the accounting policies of the Group and of the Company which will have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements other than as disclosed below:

Lease Terms

Some leases contain extension options exercisable by the Group before the end of the non-cancellable contract period. In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances including the past practice and any cost that will be incurred to change the asset if an option to extend is not taken. An extension option is only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated).

# Government Grants

The Group presents government grants related to an asset by setting up the grants as deferred income and are amortised to profit or loss on a systematic basis over the expected useful life of the relevant asset.

# Goodwill

Goodwill is initially measured at cost. Subsequent to the initial recognition, the goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. A bargain purchase gain is recognised in profit or loss immediately.

# Financial Instruments

(i) Financial Assets

Financial Assets Through Profit or Loss

The financial assets are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to the initial recognition, the financial assets are remeasured to their fair values at the reporting date with fair value changes recognised in profit or loss. The fair value changes do not include interest and dividend income.

# Financial Instruments (Cont'd)

(i) Financial Assets (Cont'd)

Financial Assets at Amortised Cost

The financial assets are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs except for trade receivables without significant financing component which are measured at transaction price only. Subsequent to the initial recognition, all financial assets are measured at amortised cost less any impairment losses.

Financial Assets Through Other Comprehensive Income

The financial assets are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs. Subsequent to the initial recognition, the financial assets are remeasured to their fair values at the reporting date with fair value changes taken up in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the fair value reserve, except for the recognition of impairment, interest income and foreign exchange difference of a debt instrument which are recognised directly in profit or loss. The fair value changes do not include interest and dividend income.

(ii) Financial Liabilities

Financial Liabilities Through Profit or Loss

The financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to the initial recognition, the financial liabilities are remeasured to their fair values at the reporting date with fair value changes recognised in profit or loss. The fair value changes do not include interest expense.

Financial Liabilities at Amortised Cost

The financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value less transaction costs. Subsequent to the initial recognition, the financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost.

(iii) Equity

Ordinary Shares

Ordinary shares are recorded on initial recognition at the proceeds received less directly attributable transaction costs incurred. The ordinary shares are not remeasured subsequently.

Treasury Shares

Treasury shares are recorded on initial recognition at the consideration paid less directly attributable transaction costs incurred. The treasury shares are not remeasured subsequently.

No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the treasury shares. If such shares are issued by resale, any difference between the sales consideration received and the carrying amount of the treasury shares is recognised in equity. Where treasury shares are cancelled, their carrying amounts are shown as a movement in retained profits.

# Property, Plant and Equipment

All items of property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost.

Subsequent to initial recognition, all property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.

Freehold land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their depreciable amounts over the estimated useful lives. The principal annual depreciation rates are:

<table><tr><td>Freehold buildings</td><td>25 - 50 years</td></tr><tr><td>Long-term leasehold buildings</td><td>60 years</td></tr><tr><td>Land improvement</td><td>14%</td></tr><tr><td>Factory and office renovation</td><td>5% - 10%</td></tr><tr><td>Plant and machinery</td><td>10% - 20%</td></tr><tr><td>Workshop tools</td><td>10% - 20%</td></tr><tr><td>Office equipment</td><td>10% - 33.3%</td></tr><tr><td>Furniture and fittings</td><td>10% - 33.3%</td></tr><tr><td>Motor vehicles</td><td>10% - 20%</td></tr><tr><td>Computers</td><td>33.3%</td></tr></table>

# Investments in Subsidiaries

Investments in subsidiaries, which are eliminated on consolidation, are stated in the separate financial statements of the Company at cost less impairment losses, if any.

# Right-of-use Assets and Lease Liabilities

(i) Short-term Leases and Leases of Low-value Assets

The Group and the Company apply the "short-term lease" and "lease of low-value assets" recognition exemption. For these leases, the Group and the Company recognise the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line method over the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is more appropriate.

(ii) Right-of-use Assets

Right-of-use assets are initially measured at cost. Subsequent to the initial recognition, the right-of-use assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities.

The right-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the estimated useful lives of the right-of-use assets or the end of the lease term.

# Right-of-use Assets and Lease Liabilities (Cont'd)

# (iii) Lease Liabilities

Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the entities' incremental borrowing rate. Subsequent to the initial recognition, the lease liabilities are measured at amortised cost and adjusted for any lease reassessment or modifications.

# Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on the first-in, first-out method and comprises all costs of purchase plus other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.

# 4. OPERATING SEGMENTS

Malaysia  
Singapore  
- Philippines  
Taiwan

# 15. GOODWILL ON CONSOLIDATION (CONT'D)

The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined using the value in use approach, and this is derived from the present value of the future cash flows from each CGU computed based on the projections of financial forecast covering a period of 5 years. The key assumptions used in the determination of the recoverable amounts are as follows:

<table><tr><td></td><td>2024
%</td><td>2023
%</td></tr><tr><td>Budgeted gross margin</td><td>18 to 62</td><td>16 to 59</td></tr><tr><td>Growth rates</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>- Year 1</td><td>3 to 5</td><td>3 to 5</td></tr><tr><td>- Year 2 to 5</td><td>3 to 5</td><td>3 to 8</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-tax discount rates</td><td>14 to 19</td><td>17 to 18</td></tr></table>

# (i) Budgeted gross margin

Management determines budgeted gross margin based on past performance and its expectations of market development.

# (ii) Growth rates

The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts. Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market. These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management and extrapolated cash flows for a five-year period based on growth rates consistent with the long-term average growth rate for the industry.

# (iii) Discount rates

Management estimates discount rate using pre-tax rate that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risk specific to the CGU. The rate used to discount the forecasted cash flows reflects specific risks and expected returns relating to the industry.

# (iv) Terminal value

Terminal value is based on zero growth of projected present value of particular subsidiaries from year 2029 until infinity.

The values assigned to the key assumptions represent management's assessment of future trends in the CGUs and are based on both external sources and internal historical data.

The management believes that there is no reasonable change in the above key assumptions which would cause the carrying amount of the goodwill to exceed its recoverable amounts.

Market Risk (Cont'd)

(ii) Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The exposure to interest rate risk arises mainly from investments in fixed rate debt securities and long-term borrowing with variable rate. The Group adopts a policy of obtaining the most favourable interest rates available and by maintaining a balanced portfolio mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings.

The fixed rate debt instruments of the Group are not subject to interest rate risk since neither carrying amounts nor the future cash flows will fluctuate because of a change in market interest rates.

Interest Rate Risk Sensitivity Analysis

The Group does not have any floating rate borrowings and hence, no sensitivity analysis is presented.

(iii) Equity price risk

The exposure to equity price risk arises mainly from changes in quoted investment prices of the Group. The Group manages its exposure to equity price risk by maintaining a portfolio of equities with different risk profiles.

Equity Price Risk Sensitivity Analysis

If prices for quoted investments at the end of the reporting period strengthened by  $10\%$  (2023:  $10\%$ ) with all other variables being held constant, the Group's and the Company's profit after taxation would have increased by RM4,214,365 and RM3,005,986 (2023: RM3,264,766 and RM1,736,961) respectively. A  $10\%$  (2023:  $10\%$ ) weakening in the quoted prices would have had an equal but opposite effect on the Group's and the Company's profit after taxation.

# Credit Risk

The exposure to credit risk, or the risk of counterparties defaulting, arises mainly from trade and other receivables. The Group and the Company manage their exposures to credit risk by the application of credit approvals, credit limits and monitoring procedures on an ongoing basis. For other financial assets (including quoted investments, cash and bank balances), the Group and the Company minimise credit risk by dealing exclusively with high credit rating counterparties.

Also, the Company's exposure to credit risk includes loans and advances to subsidiaries, and corporate guarantee given to financial institutions for credit facilities granted to certain subsidiaries. The Company monitors the ability of the subsidiaries to serve their loans on an individual basis.

(i) Credit risk concentration profile

At the end of the reporting period, the Group's major concentration of credit risk relates to the amounts owing by 2 (2023: 2) customers which constituted approximately  $39\%$  (2023:  $34\%$ ) of its total trade receivables (including related parties), net of loss allowance.

(ii) Maximum exposure to credit risk

At the end of the reporting period, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each class of financial assets recognised in the statement of financial position of the Group and of the Company after deducting any allowance for impairment losses (where applicable).

(iii) Assessment of impairment losses

The Group has an informal credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis through periodic review of the ageing of the receivables. The Group closely monitors the receivables' financial strength to reduce the risk of loss.

At each reporting date, the Group evaluate whether any of the financial assets at amortised cost are credit impaired.

The gross carrying amount of financial asset is written off against the associated impairment, if any, when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery despite the fact that they are still subject to enforcement activities.

A financial asset is credit impaired when any of following events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred:

Significant financial difficulty of the receivable;  
- A breach of contract, such as a default or past due event;  
- Restructuring of a debt in relation to the receivable's financial difficulty; and  
It is becoming probable that the receivable will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation.

The Group considers a receivable to be in default when the receivable is unlikely to repay its debt to the Group in full or is more than 365 days past due unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a more a lagging default criterion is more appropriate. The Group uses a more lagging past due criterion for certain trade receivables when it is more appropriate to reflect their loss patterns.

Trade receivables

The Group applies the simplified approach to measure expected credit losses using a lifetime expected credit loss allowance for all trade receivables.

Inputs, Assumptions and Techniques used for Estimating Impairment Losses

To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables (including related parties) have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due.

The Group measures the expected credit losses of certain major customers, trade receivables that are credit impaired and trade receivables with a high risk of default on an individual basis.

The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over 60 months (2023: 60 months) before the reporting date and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the trade receivables to settle their debts using the linear regressive analysis. The Group has identified the Gross Domestic Product as the key macroeconomic factor of the forward-looking information.

There are no significant changes in the estimation techniques and assumptions as compared to the previous financial year.

The movements in the loss allowances in respect of trade receivables is disclosed in Note 14 to the financial statements.

Other receivables

The Group and the Company apply the 3-stage general approach to measuring expected credit losses for its other receivables.

Inputs, Assumptions and Techniques used for Estimating Impairment Losses

Under this approach, the Group and the Company assess whether there is a significant increase in credit risk for receivables by comparing the risk of a default as at the reporting date with the risk of default as at the date of initial recognition. The Group and the Company consider there has been a significant increase in credit risk when there are changes in contractual terms or delay in payment. Regardless of the assessment, a significant increase in credit risk is presumed if a receivable is more than 30 days past due in making a contractual payment.

Inputs, Assumptions and Techniques used for Estimating Impairment Losses (Cont'd)

The Group and the Company use 3 categories to reflect their credit risk and how the loss allowance is determined for each category:

<table><tr><td>Category</td><td>Definition of Category</td><td>Loss Allowance</td></tr><tr><td>Performing:</td><td>Receivables have a low risk of default and a strong capacity to meet contractual cash flows</td><td>12-months expected credit losses</td></tr><tr><td>Underperforming:</td><td>Receivables for which there is a significant increase in credit risk</td><td>Lifetime expected credit losses</td></tr><tr><td>Not performing:</td><td>There is evidence indicating the receivable is credit impaired or more than 90 days past due</td><td>Lifetime expected credit losses</td></tr></table>

The Group and the Company measure the expected credit losses of receivables having significant balances, receivables that are credit impaired and receivables with a high risk of default on an individual basis. The remaining receivables are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and assessed on a collective basis.

Loss allowance is measured on either 12-month expected credit losses or lifetime expected credit losses, by considering the likelihood that the receivable would not be able to repay during the contractual period (probability of default, PD), the percentage of contractual cash flows that will not be collected if default happens (loss given default, LGD) and the outstanding amount that is exposed to default risk (exposure at default).

In deriving the PD and LGD, the Group and the Company consider the receivable's past payment status and its financial condition as at the reporting date. The PD is adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the receivable to settle its debts using the linear regressive analysis. The Group and the Company have identified the Gross Domestic Product as the key macroeconomic factor of the forward-looking information.

There are no significant changes in the estimation techniques and assumptions as compared to the previous financial year.

Allowance for Impairment Losses

Based on the assessment performed, the identified impairment loss was immaterial and hence, it is not provided for.

- Fixed deposits with licensed banks, cash and bank balances

The Group and the Company consider the licensed banks have low credit risks. In addition, some of the bank balances are insured by Government agencies. Therefore, the Group and the Company are of the view that the loss allowance is immaterial and hence, it is not provided for.

Amount owing by subsidiaries

The Company applies the 3-stage general approach to measuring expected credit losses for amount owing by subsidiaries.

Inputs, Assumptions and Techniques used for Estimating Impairment Losses

The Company measures the expected credit losses on an individual basis, which is aligned with its credit risk management practices on the inter-company balances.

The Company considers loans and advances to subsidiaries have low credit risks. The Company assumes that there is a significant increase in credit risk when a subsidiary's financial position deteriorates significantly. As the Company is able to determine the timing of payments of the loans and advances when they are payable, the Company considers the loans and advances to be in default when the subsidiaries are not able to pay when demanded.

For loans and advances that are repayable on demand, impairment loss is assessed based on the assumption that repayment of the outstanding balances is demanded at the reporting date. If the subsidiary does not have sufficient highly liquid resources when the loans and advances are demanded, the Company will consider the expected manner of recovery to measure the impairment loss; the recovery manner could be either through 'repayable over time' or a fire sale of less liquid assets by the subsidiary.

For loans and advances that are not repayable on demand, impairment loss is measured using techniques that are similar for estimating the impairment losses of other receivables as disclosed above.

There are no significant changes in the estimation techniques and assumptions as compared to the previous financial year.

(b) Capital Risk Management

The Group and the Company manage their capital to ensure that entities within the Group will be able to maintain an optimal capital structure so as to support their businesses and maximise shareholders value. To achieve this objective, the Group and the Company may make adjustments to the capital structure in view of changes in economic conditions, such as adjusting the amount of dividend payment, returning of capital to shareholders or issuing new shares.

The Group and the Company manage their capital based on debt-to-equity ratio. The Group's strategies were unchanged from the previous financial year. The debt-to-equity ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total equity. Net debt is calculated as external borrowings less cash and bank balances and fixed deposits with licensed banks.

There were no changes in the approach to capital management during the financial year.

The debt-to-equity ratio is not disclosed in the financial statements as the external borrowing is insignificant.

# NOTICE OF TWENTY-FIRST ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING (CONT'D)

# Explanatory Notes on Ordinary Business:

# 1. Item 1 of the Agenda

This Agenda item is meant for discussion only as the provision of Section 340(1)(a) of the Act does not require a formal approval of the shareholders for the Audited Financial Statements. Hence, this item is not put forward to shareholders for voting.

# 2. Item 2 of the Agenda

The Nomination Committee has evaluated Mr Ng Chee Whye and Ms Koh Huey Min based on the Board Effectiveness Evaluation carried out by an external expert including the "Fit and Proper Test" to assess them and they were found to have met the Board's expectation in discharging their duties and responsibilities and recommended to the Board for their re-election. In turn, the Board recommends to the shareholders to re-elect Mr Ng Chee Whye and Ms Koh Huey Min at the 21st AGM or any adjournment thereof.

# 3. Item 3 of the Agenda

Section 230(1) of the Act requires that the fees of the directors and any benefits payable to the directors be approved at a general meeting.

# Explanatory Notes on Special Business:

# 4. Item 5 of the Agenda

The proposed Ordinary Resolution 5, if passed, will empower the Directors from the conclusion of this AGM, to allot and issue up to a maximum of  $10\%$  of the total number of issued shares of the Company (excluding treasury shares) at the time of issue (other than bonus or rights issue) until the conclusion of the next AGM of the Company without the need to convene a general meeting and for such purposes as they consider would be in the best interest of the Company. This authority, unless revoked or varied at a general meeting, will expire at the conclusion of next AGM of the Company. The Board is of the view that the  $10\%$  general mandate is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders as it would provide the flexibility to the Company for any possible fundraising activities that the Company may undertake for working capital and/or any investment or acquisition purposes in an expeditious and efficient manner. At this juncture, there is no decision to issue any additional share. If there should be a decision to issue any new share after the general mandate is sought, the Company will make an announcement in respect thereof.

The proposed Ordinary Resolution 5 is a renewal of the general mandate for issuance of shares pursuant to Sections 75 and 76 of the Act obtained at the 20th AGM held on 14 June 2024 which will lapse at the conclusion of this 21st AGM. As at the date of this notice, the Company did not issue any share pursuant to the said general mandate.

# 5. Item 6 of the Agenda

The proposed Ordinary Resolution 6, if passed, will give the Directors of the Company the authority to take all such steps as are necessary or expedient to implement, finalise, complete and/or effect the purchase(s) of Shares by the Company as the Directors may deem fit and expedient in the best interest of the Company. This authority will, unless renewed or revoked or varied by the Company at a general meeting, continue to be in force until the conclusion of the next AGM or any adjournment thereof of the Company or the expiry of the period within which the next AGM of the Company following the 21st AGM is required by the law to be held. Please refer to the Share Buy-Back Statement dated 29 April 2025 which is circulated together with this Notice for more information.
