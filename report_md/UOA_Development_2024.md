# MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

# OVERVIEW OF GROUP'S BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS

In financial year ("FY") 2024, the nation's economy grew at a faster pace compared to the previous year. The gradual improvement in the property market continued in FY2024 where UOA Development Bhd and its subsidiaries (the "Group") experienced an improved buyer confidence. The Group is optimistic about the property market sentiment while remaining cautious of potential headwinds.

Capitalising on the positive market sentiments, the Group launched two notable projects in FY2024, namely, Bamboo Hills Residences and Duo Tower, with a combined Gross Development Value ("GDV") of RM2.7 billion. The

sales from new projects as well as existing projects contributed to a total property sales for the Group, which amounted to approximately RM1.0 billion, with residential properties accounting for  $93\%$  of sales and commercial properties making up the remaining  $7\%$ .

Revenue for the financial year was largely derived from the progressive recognition of ongoing development projects and inventory sales. Meanwhile, the continued improvement in rental income and stronger performance in our hospitality segment further supported the Group's financial results during this period.

Summary of the Group's financial and share price performance for the past five (5) years:

# REVIEW OF FINANCIAL RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

The financial year 2024 saw some improvement compared to the previous year. The Group's property development segment generated a total revenue of RM545.7 million, translating to a profit after tax and minority interests ("PATAMI") of RM287.3 million.

Benchmarked against the previous financial year, the Group's revenue for FY2024 of RM545.7 million showed an improvement compared to RM399.4 million in FY2023. This recovery was primarily driven by higher progressive recognition from both our existing projects as well as projects launched during FY2024, namely, Laurel Residence, Aster Hill, as well as the medical centre in Bangsar South. The Group recorded unbilled sales of RM831.8 million at year-end as a result of improvement in our property sales.

The Group recorded a PATAMI of RM287.3 million in FY2024, an increase from the RM279.6 million achieved in

the previous year. While higher revenue was the main contributor to this improvement, it was partly offset by higher cost of sale and an increase in other expenses. There was fair value gain on investment properties of RM44.2 million recorded in FY2024.

Other income also experienced healthy growth, rising to RM383.1 million in FY2024 from RM354.3 million in the preceding year. This increase is primarily attributed to higher rental income, predominantly from commercial properties, and income from our hospitality division, mainly from our hotels in Bangsar South and Komune Living and Wellness in Cheras.

As of 31 December 2024, the Group maintained a robust financial position with cash and cash equivalents anchored at RM1.8 billion. Our balance sheet remains healthy, with a net cash position enabling us to explore potential attractive land acquisition and development opportunities.

The Group's total property sale in FY2024 grew  $21\%$  year-on-year to approximately RM1 billion from RM827.3 million, backed by our new launches and existing projects including Bamboo Hills Residences, Aster Hill, Duo Tower

and Laurel Residence. During FY2024, Bamboo Hills Residences and Duo Tower were launched and are poised to contribute positively to the Group's financial performance.

Located in the heart of Bangsar South, the development is supported by ample amenities. This project has a GDV of RM550 million.

# Anticipated / Known Risks and Moving Forward

While there was improvement in market sentiments in FY2024, the Group maintains its cautious position amid a global trade tension, inflationary environment and uncertain real estate market. Notwithstanding that, the Group will continue to exercise caution in these volatile market conditions and build a sustainable long-term growth.

Moving forward, the Group remains focused on its geographical emphasis in Klang Valley while explores other potential growth opportunities and locations.

Aside from maintaining operating stability, the Group's key priorities are to fostering positive stakeholder engagement and building long-term value for the shareholders. In FY2024, the Group maintained its dividend policy of paying  $30\%$  to  $50\%$  of realised PATAMI.

# MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT

In the year under review, our SCWG continuously monitors the business environment and engages with various stakeholders on an on-going basis to ensure we have appropriately recognised the risks and opportunities presented by our operating environment, the needs of our stakeholders, as well as manage our sustainability areas. We considered the following:

i. Issues that matter to UOA's business performance;  
ii. Issues that matter to UOA's stakeholders; and  
iii. Issues that presently have or could potentially have an impact on UOA.

# MATERIALITY MATRIX

The materiality matrix below illustrates thirteen (13) material topics aligned along the x-axis to indicate their significance of the economic, environmental, and social impacts. Simultaneously, these topics are positioned along the y-axis to reflect their influence on stakeholder assessments and decisions concerning our business engagements.

# Our Indirect Economic Impact

Indirect economic impacts refer to the broader, often long-term effects of our business activities on the economy and surrounding communities. The Group recognises the significance of these impacts, extending beyond our direct financial performance, influencing areas such as infrastructure improvement, local development, and overall community well-being. Hence, UOA continues to improve the quality of

life of local communities through constructing or upgrading surrounding amenities and infrastructure where necessary.

At UOA, we focus on investing in local amenities, particularly public transport development, to improve accessibility to our properties and provide car alternatives, reducing carbon emissions.

# Product and Service Quality and Satisfaction

Product and service quality is integral to Our Group's success, driving customer satisfaction, our reputation, and the value we create. We uphold this through adherence to the following standards:

<table><tr><td>Entity</td><td>Certification</td><td>Scope</td><td>Description</td><td>Original Issued Date</td><td>Expired Date</td></tr><tr><td>AECSB</td><td>ISO 9001: 2015</td><td>Quality Management Systems</td><td>Provision of construction services for building and civil engineering works</td><td>8 December 2017</td><td>30 March 2026</td></tr><tr><td>AECSB</td><td>ISO 45001: 2018</td><td>Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems</td><td>Provision of construction services for building and civil engineering works</td><td>31 March 2017</td><td>30 March 2026</td></tr><tr><td>URCSB</td><td>ISO 9001: 2015</td><td>Quality Management Systems</td><td>Provision of construction services for building and civil engineering works</td><td>20 October 2024</td><td>19 October 2027</td></tr></table>

AECSB - Allied Engineering Construction Sdn Bhd  
URCSB - URC Engineering Sdn Bhd

These standards are embedded within our Quality Manual, ensuring our processes and practices align with internationally recognised benchmarks. Our Quality Manual ensures the delivery of high-quality products to customers where we place importance on risk and impact analysis using Monitoring, Measurement, Analysis and Evaluation methodology. The manual defines our Group's Quality Management System ("QMS"), offering a structured framework to achieve and sustain high-quality standards. It serves as a comprehensive guide to promote consistent and continuous improvement in the quality of our processes, products, and services.

At UOA, we are committed to continuously enhancing the effectiveness of our QMS by:

- Delivering products and services that meet the highest standards of quality, safety, reliability, and customer satisfaction, addressing the needs and expectations of both our customers and stakeholders.  
- Achieving our quality objectives through the establishment, implementation, and ongoing improvement of our QMS.

Through these efforts, UOA identifies and pursues opportunities for improvement, taking decisive actions to meet customer requirements and improve satisfaction. We analyse the results of project improvements and the outcomes of our Management Review to inform and guide necessary corrective actions.

Furthermore, for product quality of our construction and project sites, we benchmark our completed projects against the Quality Assessment System in Construction ("QLASSIC") by the Construction Industry Development Board ("CIDB"). This system measures workmanship quality upon completion of projects, according to Construction Industry Standards (CIS 7:2014), ensuring adherence to high standards.

We completed our residential project, i.e. Laurel Residence in FYE 2024 and registered a QLASSIC score of  $79\%$ , meeting our target score of  $70\%$  set for FYE 2024.

# SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT

We recognise that effective procurement practices are essential for maintaining a reliable supply of operational resources whilst upholding high-quality standards. Here at UOA, we are committed to securing the best value for the company without compromising on quality or ethical standards. To achieve this, we conduct due diligence, including on-site visits, to ensure proper authorisation for work in Malaysia.

Our supply chain strategy is also aligned with core principles such as compliance, equality, the prohibition of forced and child labour, and minimising environmental

impact. These principles guide our supply chain practices, which include a Quality Manual, Purchasing Control Policy, and New Vendor Selection and Registration process.

Our Purchasing Control Policy also ensures that all procured goods meet the highest quality standards. Supplier selection is based on criteria such as track record, financial stability, and commitment to quality. We adhere to established standards, including ISO 9001 and the Quality Manual, and conduct annual assessments of our suppliers and vendors. Additionally, we carry out re-evaluations (Vendor Performance Reviews) before renewing contracts, considering factors such as product quality, frequency of end-user complaints, pricing consistency, and overall service performance.

Overall, we also expect our vendors to comply with all relevant social and labour laws. Ensuring compliance throughout our supply chain is crucial, particularly given the vicarious corporate liability. As such, we utilise our Purchasing Control Policy to conduct our due diligence.

To mitigate risks from unforeseen disruptions in our supply chain, we adopt a proactive approach by working with multiple sources and service providers. This strategy strengthens our supply chain's resilience and reduces vulnerabilities associated with the availability of critical materials.

# LOCAL Procurement

We recognise the importance of local procurement in supporting the local economies and job creation where we operate. Therefore, our approach looks to engaging with local suppliers whenever feasible, provided they meet our price, quality, performance, and ethical standards.

This approach enables us to support the local markets without compromising our interests and needs, but also reduces our ecological footprint, nurturing growth in local communities. Every year, we aim for a minimum of  $90\%$  local procurement and the following table reflects the percentage of spending on local suppliers for three (3) consecutive years, on a Group level:

# TECHNOLOGY, DIGITAL INNOVATION AND CYBERSECURITY

In Malaysia's evolving property development landscape, technology and digital innovation play a pivotal role in transforming the industry. At UOA, we continue to work on enhancing our product offerings and customer service, staying informed of industry trends to better serve our customers.

# BUILDING ON A COLLECTIVE DIGITAL MOMENTUM

Today's businesses thrive together with technology. Staying relevant means keeping pace with a technology landscape that evolves more rapidly than ever. As part of our on-going The Tech Collective initiatives, UOA continues to share technology news with the community through our social media platform. At the same time, we endeavour to nurture the community by connecting them with industry experts on today's technology.

The events and workshops initiated by UOA in FYE 2024 for The Tech Collective community are summarised as follows.

<table><tr><td>Topics</td><td>Contents</td></tr><tr><td>Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI)</td><td>GradientX Academy shares insights on the Power of AI Monetisation with real case studies on how AI could help companies generate new revenue streams.</td></tr><tr><td>AI Technology</td><td>Discussions with experts on how companies could use AI Technology to help them in meeting their EESG metric.</td></tr><tr><td>Games for Brand</td><td>Game developers and technologists together to discuss how immersive content and new technology can revolutionise brand engagement.</td></tr><tr><td>From Hype to Reality: AI Applications in Transforming Healthcare</td><td>Panellists exchange views on how AI transformed the healthcare industry.</td></tr><tr><td>Democratising Creativity: GenAl and Human Ingenuity</td><td>The impact of GenAl on creativity and how it balances with the importance of human intuition and emotion.</td></tr><tr><td>AI and Machine Learning: Driving Innovation in Malaysia</td><td>Industry experts shared their views on the future of chatbots that align with AI principles, and building responsible AI systems for organisations, as well as how to build trustworthy GenAl that meets cybersecurity guidelines.</td></tr></table>

# CYBERSECURITY

As technology continues to evolve, the risk of cybersecurity threats also increases. Consequently, as we incorporate more technological and digital innovations into our projects, protecting data and securing systems remains a priority.

To mitigate these risks, we have implemented our Cybersecurity Policy that complies with Malaysia's Personal Data Protection Act 2010, ensuring the protection of customer data. This policy applies to all stakeholders and serves as an incident response plan. As part of our employee onboarding process, we also ensure that all staff are thoroughly informed about the Cybersecurity Policy and their responsibilities.

# CYBERSECURITY (CONTINUED)

The table below outlines the key initiatives covered in our Cybersecurity Policy.

<table><tr><td>Initiative</td><td>Protective measures</td></tr><tr><td>Hardware</td><td>Security measures for our physical assets, including server rooms and office computers, to prevent unauthorized access. These include access controls, Closed-Circuit Television (“CCTV”) surveillance, and alarms. Each of our business units also has its respective server rooms to ensure secure, localised data storage and efficient management of critical systems.</td></tr><tr><td>Networking</td><td>Security protocols for firewalls, our internal network, and web-based applications to protect against online threats. These include firewall rules, and regular vulnerability assessments.A Point-to-Point (P2P) connection is implemented as a contingency plan due to its reliability, low latency, and secure direct link between systems, ensuring seamless communication and data transfer in the event of network disruptions.Additional cybersecurity measures include the Implementation of:· Microsoft 365 Defender.• Windows Server Update Service (“WSUS”).· Firewall, and antivirus solutions.• Stringent Wi-Fi access control, disabling off-site access to the company network.</td></tr><tr><td>Integration</td><td>Ensuring secure integration between our internal network and web-based applications. This involves implementing secure Application Programming Interfaces (“APIs”) for data exchange, encrypting data in transit, periodic audits, and monitoring.</td></tr><tr><td>Operation of System</td><td>Policies and practices related to system operations, including user access control. This includes user authentication with a strong password and multi-factor authentication (“MFA”), Role-Based Access Controls (“RBAC”), Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (“IDPS”), and Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”)/ Transport Layer Security (“TLS”) encryption for secure data transmission, security training and awareness programmes, and an incident response plan.</td></tr><tr><td>Backup and Disaster Recovery</td><td>Procedures and strategies for data backup and recovery. This includes on-site backups for crucial UOA Group systems such as financial servers.</td></tr></table>

For Hospitality, we have established a dedicated Wide Area Network (WAN) for guests, which includes an annual restoration test and automated fail-safe redundancy to ensure uninterrupted network service.

In FYE 2024, we also leveraged VMware by installing a virtual machine on our server. VMware, the new software we installed for our e-invoicing and Property Management System (PMS), allows us to optimise performance without the need for purchasing new physical servers. We also upgraded the processor, RAM, and storage to support the

new virtual machine. This upgrade not only reduces waste and e-waste but also helps minimise server costs, electricity consumption, and the need for additional hardware space.

To further strengthen our security, we have an ongoing Anti-Phishing Awareness programme for our employees. This initiative helps raise awareness about fraudulent emails and communications, empowering staff to identify and respond to potential phishing threats effectively.

# CYBERSECURITY (CONTINUED)

Overall, we are also pleased to report that, during the reporting periods, we received no complaints regarding breaches of customer privacy or losses of customer data in FYE 2024.

# ANTI-CORRUPTION

We are aware of the significant risks posed by potential occurrences of bribery and corruption that we are exposed to within our business operations. These risks are particularly pronounced due to our operations in the property development sector, especially regarding land acquisition and the potential for illicit incentives, which presents heightened risks.

Here at UOA, we are guided by our Code of Conduct, Anti-Bribery and Corruption ("ABC") Policy, and Whistleblowing Policy to manage and mitigate these risks, ensuring compliance with the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act Section 17A ("MACCS17A").

To ensure awareness and ongoing compliance with our ABC Policy and procedures, we conduct training for our employees. The following table illustrates the extent of participation in our formal anti-corruption training.

# PROTECT OUR ENVIRONMENT

# CLIMATE CHANGE

With no signs of abatement in global warming, the impacts of climate change are an imperative consideration in our business operations. Given that our business revolves around real estate and in greater Kuala Lumpur, we are exposed to various climate change risks, including those related to flooding, energy security and urban heat island effect. To address these risks, UOA undertakes a process of evaluating sustainability risks within the Group and aligning them with climate-related risks in property development and construction.

We acknowledge the need to manage energy consumption and reduce GHG emissions, and promote sustainable development in response to climate change. We maintain a continuous commitment to enhancing our approach, oversight, and transparency regarding climate change risks.

UOA's approaches to managing the climate change risks associated with our business operations include but are not limited to:

# Sustainable Building Design

Use of energy-efficient lighting, lifts and escalators.  
Installation of solar panels for renewable energy generation.  
Installation of EV charging bays.  
Use of centralised air conditioning system to reduce the overall energy consumption in buildings.

# Ecosystem Preservation/Biodiversity

Integration of green spaces as featured amenities.  
- Tree transplantation to maintain or create natural habitats for wildlife, provide shade and help cool the surroundings.

# Land Conservation

- Soil excavated during construction is stored on site in a designated area for re-use after the completion of the foundation and basement structure or sent to another sites for re-use.

# Water Management

Use of water-efficient fittings.  
- Rainwater harvesting for use as landscape irrigation, toilets and cleaning of common areas.  
Use of native or adaptive plants to reduce potable water consumption.  
Installation of flood sensors at designated buildings to monitor potential flooding and early detection so that actions can be taken promptly to safeguard against water damage and prevent water wastage.

# Pollution Controls

- Slope protections are used during construction for both erosion and dust control.

# ENERGY AND EMISSION MANAGEMENT

# ENERGY

We are acutely aware of the potential impacts of climate change on the reliability of electricity supply for our operations. This includes disruptions to power plants, transmission grids and coal and natural gas mining regions which are crucial to Malaysia's power generation that still relies on non-renewable sources. With the on-going rise of energy costs for the foreseeable future as well, we recognise the challenges this poses to our business. In recognising these risks, we continually monitor and improve on the energy consumption levels of our operations.

Our energy consumption is mainly from purchased electricity  $(86\%)$ , which is utilised in our construction sites, corporate offices, office buildings and retail spaces, as well as hotels and convention centres. In FYE 2024, we recorded a total energy consumption of 134,467 Gigajoule ("GJ").

ELECTRICITY

DIESEL AND PETROL

Energy conversion factors used for vehicles is based on fuel or diesel litre consumption derived from UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2024, 2023 and 2022.

Energy consumption for the Group has been increased by  $15.9\%$  compared to FYE 2023. This is due to the increase in business activities of the Group.

# RENEWABLE ENERGY

In addition to energy-saving and energy-efficient initiatives, we continued our efforts in the production of sustainable energy with the installation of solar panels. We are actively exploring other renewable energy solutions, other than solar panels, across our properties.

Currently, we have a rooftop solar system for selfconsumption in Bamboo Hills Retail and The Sphere @ Bangsar South. This reduces our reliance on grid power, lowers electricity bills, and decreases the carbon footprint of our development. These solar panels generated 551.2 MWh of solar power in FYE 2024, equivalent to a carbon emissions reduction of 322.4 tCO2.

# EMISSIONS

Emissions monitoring and control are crucial for UOA, given the potential for substantial greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions stemming from our energy-intensive industry. Our carbon emissions primarily result from energy consumption, which includes the direct combustion of fossil fuels (Scope 1) and purchased electricity (Scope 2), a common scenario in industries such as construction and property development. While we recognise the importance of addressing and reducing these emissions, we also acknowledge that we have not yet established a formal emissions management framework, indicating an area where we aim to make improvements. Despite the absence of specific targets or roadmaps, our commitment to monitoring and addressing Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions remains unwavering, underscoring our dedication to responsible emissions management.

# WASTE MANAGEMENT

We are acutely aware of the risks to the environment and the regulatory guidelines on proper waste disposal and management. Effective waste management remains one of the environmental challenges we face. Our commitment to effective waste management and disposal includes waste reduction and responsible disposal methods, such as recycling, reusing, and proper handling of hazardous waste.

We acknowledge that more can be done to recycle waste and we will continue to expand these efforts.

We have implemented various initiatives in our business segments to address these concerns. These include the following:

# Property Development and Construction Initiatives

Use of Durable Aluminium Formwork System instead of plywood to reduce concrete waste.  
We identify and segregate construction waste at project sites so that waste can be managed and disposed accordingly. We set up different bins for general waste, debris and steel scrap. Additionally, we resell steel scrap to recycling companies, diverting them from landfills.

# Property Investment Initiatives

Recycle festive decoration materials to reduce wastage.  
Identify and segregate waste initiated at Bamboo Hills Retail. In FYE 2024, we have implemented segregation of waste at 2 additional locations, i.e. UOA Southlink Retail and Nexus.  
Cashless and ticketless visitor parking system.  
- Implementation of e-billing system initiated with Tenants of Retail.

# Hospitality (Hotels and Convention Centres) Initiatives

Identify and segregate waste initiated at Komune Living Hotel @ Bangsar South and Komune Living Hotel @ Komune Living Wellness Centre, Cheras in FYE 2024.  
Komune Living Hotel @ Bangsar South and Komune Living Hotel @ Komune Living Wellness Centre, Cheras replaced PET bottled water with glass jugs, reducing plastic waste. Filter water dispensers are also located on every floor for guests.  
- Eliminate single-use plastic.  
Any unused assets or materials will be transferred to other business units in need to prevent the waste of resources (such as linen, towels, furniture and fittings, AV equipment, etc).  
We disposed our used cooking oil from kitchen operations to operators that can repurpose them sustainably, hence minimising waste.

# Offices and Sales Galleries Initiatives

- Minimise paper consumption by encouraging:

(a) Printing and photocopying on a need basis only;  
(b) The practice of double-sided printing and photocopying;  
(c) The use of electronic devices and soft copies for work; and  
(d) The use of recycled paper and envelopes for internal circulation.

In line with our target-setting for FYE2024, we focused on implementing a system to identify and segregate our waste, tracking it by location, with a minimum target of one location. For FYE 2024, the implementation of waste segregation and tracking was successfully carried out at multiple locations as stated below, exceeding our initial target.

# GREEN SPACE AND BIODIVERSITY

We value green spaces and biodiversity in our projects to support the conservation of the environment and enhance the well-being of our occupants. We recognise the significance of incorporating green spaces and fostering biodiversity in our developments to create a harmonious coexistence with nature.

In adhering to stringent environmental and social assessment, as well as landscape planning requirements, our dedication goes beyond mere compliance. It benefits us in multiple ways. Because our projects are predominantly centralised in the Federal Territory, landscape planning helps to reduce the urban heat island effect and provide natural buffers against extreme weather events.

Our 60-acre flagship Bangsar South City development is further complemented by a 6-acre Central Park with  $40 \%$ green space and landscape areas. This 6- acre Central Park comprises landscaped boulevards, water features, and pedestrian streets. It is a green oasis and a welcoming recreational space for the community residential, commercial and retail. Recognition by the Institute of Landscape Architects Malaysia, in the category of Professional Landscape Design and Planning (Malaysia Landscape Architecture Awards 2012) is a testament to our environmental sensitivity and sustainability. Bangsar South’s lifestyle hub, The Sphere was also accorded a Landscape Design Honour Award in the Professional Category of the 11th Malaysia Landscape Architecture Awards (MLAA). The Sphere intertwines green landscaping and flowing water features for a fresh, vibrant environment. Modern steel and glass architecture creates a spacious layout that integrates both the indoor and outdoor sections of the hub. The MLAA has recognised The Sphere as exemplary in landscape

design and has deemed it an inspiration to future design trends alongside several other selected projects.

Our Komune Living Wellness Centre, located in Bandar Tun Razak, offers a holistic living environment concept to our occupants. This concept is exemplified by the property's location, which is situated within an expansive 2.06-acre site next to Taman Tasik Permaisuri, Cheras' largest public park. UOA adopted a section of the park and contributed to the preservation and maintenance. Sustaining the biodiversity, this has brought much benefits to the occupants. The development of the property next to the lake, was carefully carried out without disrupting its natural state, preserving these habitats and the local ecosystem. Additionally, it involves the creation of green buffer zones or setbacks for the residents.

The 16-acre site of our Bamboo Hills is another example of the incorporation of green space at our property. Lush bamboo landscapes, water features, and pockets of greenery at every corner, not only offer a serene space for city dwellers but also contributes to the environment.

Green spaces can also be promoted as featured amenities, as seen in our projects, such as The Goodwood Residence and Laurel Residence, in Bangsar South. Featured amenities such as discovery ponds, a fragrance garden, and a garden pool, all of which also enhance the overall experience for our occupants.

Based on our efforts to enhance green spaces and biodiversity in our properties, for the past three (3) years, we have planted more than 12,000 trees across our developments.

<table><tr><td></td><td>FYE 2022</td><td>FYE 2023</td><td>FYE 2024</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>Number of trees planted</td><td>6,144</td><td>1,665</td><td>4,658</td><td>12,467</td></tr></table>

The ERTs are well-prepared to respond promptly to various emergencies, including fire outbreaks, natural disasters, medical emergencies, accidents, robberies, civil disturbances, discovering deceased individuals, and suicide attempts. Each ERT member is assigned a specific and critical role, ensuring the safety and security of all individuals within the buildings and venues.

This multi-tiered approach ensures a comprehensive and diligent focus on health and safety across our various operations.

# CONCLUSION

As a responsible developer, UOA Group continues to drive sustainable growth and embed sustainability throughout all facets of our business. We remain focused on adapting and refining our practices to meet evolving regulatory requirements, ensuring continuous progress on

# CLIMATE REPORT:TCFD REALIGNMENT

As a company focused on physical assets, our key climate risks, such as extreme weather events, energy disruptions, and the urban heat island effect, impact business continuity. Therefore, it is important that our business decisions consider how climate-related risks and opportunities affect our operations.

In line with this, since the end of FYE 2024, we have adopted the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Our approach to managing these climate risks is structured around the four (4) key TCFD pillars, outlined below:

# a) Governance

The BOD is responsible for overseeing the management of climate-related risks, ensuring that sustainability best practices are embedded in key decision-making processes, and approving the sustainability and risk management framework. The Board also regularly reviews and discusses sustainability and risk governance matters.

Our SC, which reports to the BOD, plays a key role in reviewing and recommending group-wide climate risk strategies and performance targets for UOA. Additionally, the Committee oversees the implementation of sustainability initiatives across the organisation.

Further discussion can be found in the "Sustainability Governance" section of our Sustainability Statement.

# b) Risk management

We conduct a climate risk impact assessment to evaluate the significance of climate change risks and opportunities. Where applicable, these risks are further assessed within the Enterprise Risk Management ("ERM") framework. The findings (presented below), including identified material risks, are then presented to the BOD for guidance and advice.

our sustainability journey, and enhancing business resilience against economic challenges and climate-related risks. In doing so, we aim to stay aligned with the evolving needs of our stakeholders and contribute to the broader sustainability landscape.

# OPPORTUNITIES POSED BY CLIMATE CHANGE:

For this, we have mapped our existing Group-level risks against the specific implications on these risks because of climate change. Overall, our risks can be categorised by physical risks and transitional risks.

Physical risks refer to the direct impacts of climate change, which can be either acute or chronic. Acute physical risks are short-term, event-driven risks caused by extreme weather events and climate-related disasters, whilst chronic risks involve long-term, gradual changes in climate patterns that can affect businesses over time.

For UOA, as a company focused on land development in urban areas, our key physical risks include flooding, heatwaves, rising average temperatures, landslides, urban heat effect and shifting weather patterns.

In contrast, transitional risks stem from the global shift towards a low-carbon economy as societies respond to the challenges of climate change. According to the TCFD framework, these risks are categorised as follows:

Policy and Legal Risks  
- Technology Risks  
Market Risks  
- Reputation Risks

# RISK MANAGEMENT

The Board has established a sound risk management framework which is currently being adopted by the Management that enables it to continuously identify, evaluate, mitigate, and monitor risk that affect the Group. The risk management framework is guided by COSO - Enterprise Risk Management Integrating with Strategy and Performance. Responsibility for managing risks lies initially with the business unit concerned, working within the overall strategy outlined by the Board. Therefore, the Management has formed the Risk Management Working Committee (RMWC) which encompasses key personnel from various departments to identify potential risks, to assess the effectiveness of existing controls and to develop mitigation measures to manage significant risks.

The Board has delegated the ARMC with the assistance rendered by the internal auditors, the RMWC has formulated and developed a Risk Management Policy which was reviewed by the ARMC and approved by the Board. The Risk Management Policy is aimed to:

- Provide objectives and principles in risk management activities;  
- Establish responsibilities and accountability in risk management;  
- Establish risk management structure and process; and  
- Establish risk parameters in risk assessment.

Identified risks are categorised and assessed in terms of likelihood and consequence. Subsequently to the risk assessment, a residual risk rating is recorded after considering the effectiveness of internal controls in mitigating the risk. The outcome of the risk assessment is recorded in a Risk Register and Risk Heat Map for ARMC deliberation. The RMWC ensures that internal controls are in place and effective in mitigating the risk while the ARMC provides an oversight role in risk management.

The management has given assurance to the Board that the Group's risk management and internal control system is operating adequately and effectively, in all material aspects, based on the Group's risk management and internal control system.

For the year 2024, the Group identified major risk and mitigating actions were undertaken within appropriate timeframes. The major risks identified are as follow:

# Instability in property market

Slowdown of economy and politics instability could cause instability in property market, hence leading to slow in sales and lower revenue. To mitigate this risk, management regularly reviews its products to ensure product competitiveness for retaining customer loyalty and attracting new customers. Besides, attractive and flexible sales packages are offered to facilitate purchaser in purchasing our properties. Aggressive sales and marketing initiatives including social media marketing are in place to reach out more potential customers.

# Increase in construction cost

Increase cost in building materials, transportation and labour have caused an increased in construction cost. Management is constantly monitoring construction cost and one of the measures is to ensure that our purchase is made in accordance to budget. The increase in building material price and labour cost are also considered in preparation of budget. Regular budget meeting is held to monitor actual construction cost that are within the budget. It is also company practice to purchase building materials in bulk for better pricing and greater savings.

# Inability to lease out properties

The inability to lease out properties could result in the shrinking of occupancy rate and reduce in income. To mitigate this risk, management is constantly reviewing rental rates and compare the surrounding market rental rate to ensure competitiveness of our products. In addition, our marketing initiative through agents and online platforms has allowed us to reach out more potential tenants. Regular maintenance works and building upgrading works are conducted when necessary to ensure our properties are in good condition to retain and attract tenants.

# STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL

(Continued)

# RISK MANAGEMENT

The Group has set 4 strategies in response to any identified risk. The 4 strategies are as follows:

Risk Mitigation / Reduction - Taking steps to reduce the risk of loss by implementing more internal controls, introducing policies and procedures, providing training to staff and continuous monitoring.

Review of monthly financial information which includes actual results compared against budget, an explanation

Risk Avoidance – Taking steps to avoid the risk by either stopping business dealings/processes that potentially may give rise to threats to the Group, avoiding unnecessary business ventures which the Group is unfamiliar with and altering processes to avoid those risks.

Risk Acceptance – In cases where risks are insignificant or inherent due to business nature, the RMWC and Board will accept the risk as long as it meets the objective of the Group and processes are efficiently and effectively carried out at the minimal cost to the Group.

During an Annual General Meeting held on 28 May 2024, the shareholders of the Company resolved to approve the Company's Dividend Reinvestment Scheme ("DRS").

The DRS provides an option to the shareholders to reinvest either all or a portion of the declared dividends in new shares in lieu of receiving cash. Shareholders who did not elect to participate in the option to reinvest will receive the entire dividend wholly in cash.

During the financial year, the following dividends were declared and paid by the Company:

A first and final single tier dividend of 10 sen per ordinary share amounting to RM249,041,850 in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2023, as proposed in the Directors' report for that financial year.

The dividends of RM249,041,850 were settled as follows:

- RM225,398,004 was reinvested via the issuance of 133,371,600 new ordinary shares pursuant to the DRS to shareholders who have elected for the DRS; and  
RM23,643,846 was paid to shareholders who elected to receive the dividends in cash.

The Directors now recommend a final single tier dividend of 10 sen per ordinary share in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2024 amounting to RM262,379,010 based on 2,623,790,100 ordinary shares (net of treasury shares at the reporting date) for shareholders' approval at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

The financial statements for the current financial year do not reflect this proposed dividend. Such dividend will be accounted for in the statements of changes in equity as an appropriation of retained profits in the financial year ending 31 December 2025.

# OTHER STATUTORY INFORMATION

Before the financial statements were made out, the Directors took reasonable steps:-

(a) to ascertain the action taken in relation to the writing off of bad debts and the making of allowance for doubtful debts and satisfied themselves that all known bad debts had been written off and that adequate allowance had been made for doubtful debts; and  
(b) to ensure that any current assets which were unlikely to be realised in the ordinary course of business including their values as shown in the accounting records of the Group and of the Company had been written down to an amount which they might be expected so to realise.

At the date of this report, the Directors are not aware of any circumstances:-

(a) which would render the amount written off for bad debts or the amount of the allowance for doubtful debts in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company inadequate to any substantial extent; or  
(b) which would render the values attributed to the current assets in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company misleading; or  
(c) which have arisen which render adherence to the existing method of valuation of assets or liabilities of the Group and of the Company misleading or inappropriate; or  
(d) not otherwise dealt with in this report or the financial statements of the Group and of the Company which would render any amount stated in the respective financial statements misleading.

At the date of this report, there does not exist:-

(a) any charge on the assets of the Group and of the Company which has arisen since the end of the financial year which secures the liabilities of any other person; or  
(b) any contingent liability of the Group and of the Company which has arisen since the end of the financial year.

In the opinion of the Directors:-

(a) no contingent or other liability of the Group and of the Company has become enforceable or is likely to become enforceable within the period of twelve months after the end of the financial year which, in the opinion of the Directors, will or may affect the ability of the Group and of the Company to meet their obligations as and when they fall due;  
(b) the results of the operations of the Group and of the Company for the financial year were not substantially affected by any item, transaction or event of a material and unusual nature; and

# INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF UOA DEVELOPMENT BHD

(INCORPORATED IN MALAYSIA) REGISTRATION NO.: 200401015520 (654023-V)

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of UOA Development Bhd, which comprise the statements of financial position as at 31 December 2024 of the Group and of the Company, and the statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows of the Group and of the Company for the financial year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of material accounting policies, as set out on pages 91 to 154.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and of the Company as at 31 December 2024, and of their financial performance and their cash flows for the financial year then ended in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS Accounting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.

# Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

# Independence and Other Ethical Responsibilities

We are independent of the Group and of the Company in accordance with the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, Conduct and Practice) of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants ("By-Laws") and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) ("IESBA Code"), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the By-Laws and the IESBA Code.

# Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

# Fair value of investment properties

The risk - The Group has investment properties that are stated at fair values based on valuation reports prepared by independent professional valuers. These valuations rely on the accuracy of assumptions, estimates and financial information provided to the valuers.

Consequently, the determination of the fair values of investment properties involves significant management judgement and estimations by the Directors. As such, we have identified this area as a significant risk requiring special audit consideration.

Our response - Our audit procedures included, amongst others, evaluating the competencies, capabilities and objectivities of the independent valuers, performing site visits of all material investment properties, checking the accuracy and relevance of input data used in the valuations, evaluating the valuation amounts by comparing against comparable property sales and market data used in the valuations.

The Group's disclosures regarding investment properties are included in Notes 3.3 and 5 to the Financial Statements.

Revenue and cost of sales recognition for property development activities

The risk - The Group recognises revenue and cost of sales for property development activities based on the measurement of the Group's progress towards complete satisfaction of the Group's performance obligations.

In determining the progress, management is required to exercise significant judgement in estimating total costs to complete and total estimated revenue. As such, we have identified this area as a significant risk requiring special audit consideration.

Our response - Our audit procedures included, amongst others, inquiries with the operational and financial personnel of the Group for the assumptions used, comparing estimated costs to actual costs to assess the reliability of management's budgeting process and control, inspecting contracts with sub-contractors, performing analyses of cost budgets, understanding and evaluating the operating effectiveness of key controls surrounding revenue and cost of sales, performing site visits of all ongoing projects, performing analyses of total estimated revenue and testing the computation of recognised revenue and cost of sales.

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Key Audit Matters (continued)

Revenue and cost of sales recognition for property development activities (continued)

The Group's disclosures regarding property development activities are included in Notes 3.7, 6, 10, 29 and 30 to the Financial Statements.

There are no key audit matters in relation to the financial statements of the Company.

# Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditors' Report Thereon

The Directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but does not include the financial statements of the Group and of the Company and our auditors' report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Statements

The Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that give a true and fair view in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS Accounting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

# Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.  
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's and the Company's internal control.  
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors.

(INCORPORATED IN MALAYSIA) REGISTRATION NO.: 200401015520 (654023-V) (Continued)

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements (continued)

As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: (continued)

- Conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's or the Company's abilities to continue as going concerns. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Company to cease to continue as going concerns.  
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.  
- Plan and perform the group audit to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business units within the Group as a basis for forming an opinion on the Group financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and review of the audit work performed for purposes of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

From the matters communicated with the Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# Other Matter

This report is made solely to the members of the Company, as a body, in accordance with Section 266 of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility to any other person for the content of this report.

# NOTES TO THE

# FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024

# 1. GENERAL INFORMATION

UOA Development Bhd (the "Company") is a public limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in Malaysia, and listed on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad. The addresses of the principal place of business and registered office of the Company are disclosed in pages 81.

The Directors regard United Overseas Australia Ltd, a company incorporated in Australia and listed on the Australian Stock Exchange and the Stock Exchange of Singapore as the ultimate holding company.

The immediate holding company is UOA Holdings Sdn. Bhd., a company incorporated and domiciled in Malaysia.

The Company is principally engaged in investment holding. There has been no significant change in the Company's principal activities during the financial year. The principal activities of the subsidiary companies are disclosed in Note 7 to the Financial Statements.

The financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors in accordance with a resolution of the Directors passed on 25 March 2025.

# 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION

# 2.1 Statement of compliance

The financial statements of the Group and of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards ("MFRS"), IFRS Accounting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.

# 2.2 Basis of measurement

The financial statements of the Group and of the Company are prepared under the historical cost convention except for certain land, buildings and investments that are measured at fair values at the reporting date as disclosed in the summary of material accounting policies.

Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of consideration given in exchange for goods and services.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability, or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group or the Company.

The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.

A fair value measurement of a non-financial market takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.

The Group and the Company use valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024 (Continued)

# 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED)

# 2.2 Basis of measurement (continued)

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to their fair value measurement as a whole:

(a) Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  
(b) Level 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to their fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable  
(c) Level 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to their fair value measurement is unobservable

For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group and the Company determine whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to their fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting year.

For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group and the Company have determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of fair value hierarchy as explained above.

# 2.3 Functional and presentation currency

The financial statements are presented in Ringgit Malaysia ("RM"), which is also the Group's and the Company's functional currency. All amounts in the financial statements are rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise indicated.

# 2.4 Basis of consolidation

The Group's financial statements consolidate those of the parent company and all of its subsidiaries at 31 December 2024. All subsidiaries have a reporting date of 31 December.

# 2.5 Adoption of new standards/amendments/improvements to MFRS

At the beginning of the current financial year, the Group and Company adopted new standards/amendments/improvements to MFRS which are mandatory for the financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024. The details of the amendments that have impact on the Group's and the Company's financial statements are disclosed below.

Amendments to MFRS 101 Presentation of Financial Statements - Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current

Amendments made to MFRS 101 Presentation of Financial Statements in 2020 and 2022 clarify that liabilities are classified as either current or non-current, depending on the rights that exist at the end of the reporting period.

Classification is unaffected by the Group's and the Company's expectations or events after the reporting date (for example, the receipt of a waiver or a breach of a covenant that an entity is required to comply with only after the reporting period).

The amendments have had no significant financial impact on the Group's and the Company's financial statements.

Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture

The initial application of the above standards/amendments to MFRSs is not expected to have any material impact to the financial statements of the Group and of the Company upon adoption, except for MFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements.

MFRS 18 introduces new requirements on presentation within the statements of profit or loss, including specified totals and subtotals. It also requires disclosure of management defined performance measures and includes new requirements for aggregation and disaggregation of financial information based on the identified 'roles' of the primary financial statements and the notes. In addition, there are consequential amendments to MFRS 107 Statement of Cash Flows and MFRS 134 Interim Financial Reporting.

The amendments will have an impact on the Group's and on the Company's presentation of statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, statements of cash flows and additional disclosures in the notes to the financial statements but not on the measurement or recognition of any items in the Group's and the Company's financial statements.

The Group and the Company are currently assessing the impact of MFRS 18 and plan to adopt the new standard on the required effective date.

# 2.7 Significant accounting estimates and judgements

Estimates, assumptions concerning the future and judgements are made in the preparation of the financial statements. They affect the application of the Group's and the Company's accounting policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, expenses and disclosures made. Estimates and underlying assumptions are assessed on an on-going basis and are based on experience and relevant factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The actual result may differ from the judgements, estimates and assumptions made by management and will seldom equal the estimated results.

FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024 (Continued)

# 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED)

# 2.7 Significant accounting estimates and judgements (continued)

# 2.7.1 Estimation uncertainty

Information about significant judgements, estimates and assumptions that have the most significant effect on recognition and measurement of assets, liabilities, income and expenses are discussed below:-

Useful lives of depreciable assets

Property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. Management estimates the useful lives of the depreciable assets to be within 5 and 99 years and reviews the useful lives of depreciable assets at each reporting date. At the reporting date, management assesses that the useful lives represent the expected utility of the assets to the Group and the Company. Actual results, however, may vary due to change in the expected level of usage, physical wear and tear and technological developments, which may result in adjustments to the Group's and the Company's assets.

Deferred tax assets

Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences, unabsorbed tax losses, unutilised capital allowances and unutilised investment tax allowances to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, unabsorbed tax losses, unutilised capital allowances and unutilised investment tax allowances can be utilised.

Deferred tax assets (continued)

Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based on the likely timing and level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies.

Inventories

Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. In estimating net realisable values, management takes into account the most reliable evidence available at the time the estimates are made. The Group's core business is subject to economical changes which may cause selling prices to change rapidly and the Group's net result to change.

Fair value of investment properties

The Group measures its investment properties at fair value with any change in fair value recognised in the profit or loss. Significant judgement is required in the determination of fair value which may be derived based on different valuation methods. In making the judgement, the Group evaluates based on past experience and reliance on the work of specialists. The Group engages independent professional valuers to determine fair value.

Information regarding the valuation techniques and inputs used in determining the fair value are disclosed in Note 5 to the Financial Statements.

Property development activities and construction contracts

As revenue from ongoing property development activities and construction contracts are recognised over time, the amount of revenue recognised at the reporting date depends on the extent to which the performance obligation has been satisfied. This is done by determining the stage of completion. The stage of completion is determined by the proportion that property development or contract costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the estimated total property development or contract costs.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024 (Continued)

# 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED)

# 2.7 Significant accounting estimates and judgements (continued)

# 2.7.1 Estimation uncertainty (continued)

Property development activities and construction contracts (continued)

Significant judgement is required in determining the stage of completion, the extent of the development and contract costs incurred, the estimated total revenue and total costs and the recoverability of the development project and contract cost. In making these judgements, management relies on past experience and, if necessary, the work of specialists.

Provision for expected credit losses ("ECLs") of receivables and contract assets

The Group uses a provision matrix to calculate ECLs for receivables and contract assets. The provision rates are based on days past due for groupings of various customer segments that have similar loss patterns (i.e. by geography, product type, customer type and rating, coverage by letter of credit and other forms of credit insurance).

The provision matrix is initially based on the Group's historical observed default rates. The Group will calibrate the matrix to adjust the historical credit loss experience with forward-looking information. For instance, if forecast economic conditions (i.e. gross domestic product) are expected to deteriorate over the next year which can lead to an increased number of defaults in the real estate sector, the historical default rates are adjusted. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.

The assessment of the correlation between historical observed default rates, forecast economic conditions and ECLs is a significant estimate. The amount of ECLs is sensitive to changes in circumstances and of forecast economic conditions. The Group's historical credit loss experience and forecast of economic conditions may also not be representative of customer's actual default in the future.

# Impairment of non-financial assets

An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's or cash-generating unit's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. To determine the recoverable amount, management estimates expected future cash flows from each asset or cash-generating unit and determines a suitable interest rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. In the process of measuring expected future cash flows, management makes assumptions about future operating results. The actual results may vary, and may cause significant adjustments to the Group's and the Company's assets within the next financial year.

In most cases, determining the applicable discount rate involves estimating the appropriate adjustments to market risk and the appropriate adjustment to asset-specific risk factors.

# Income taxes

Significant judgement is involved in determining the Group's or the Company's wide provision for income taxes. There are certain transactions and computations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. The Group and the Company recognise tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recognised, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the year in which such determination is made.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024 (Continued)

# 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED)

# 2.7.2 Significant management judgements

The following are significant judgements made by management in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the financial statements.

Classification between investment properties and owner-occupied properties

The Group determines whether a property qualifies as an investment property and has developed the criteria in making that judgement. Investment property is a property held to earn rental or for capital appreciation or both.

Certain properties comprise a portion that is held to earn rental or for capital appreciation and another portion that is held for use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes. The Group accounts for the portions separately if the portions could be sold separately (or leased out separately under a finance lease). If the portions could not be sold separately, the property is an investment property only if an insignificant portion is held for use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes.

Judgement is made on an individual property basis to determine whether ancillary services are so significant that a property does not qualify as an investment property.

Deferred tax on investment properties

For the purposes of measuring deferred tax liabilities arising from investment properties that are measured using the fair value model, the management of the Group reviews the investment properties and concluded that the Group's investment properties are held under a business model whose objective is to recover the carrying amount of the investment properties through sale.

Accordingly, the Group recognises deferred taxes in respect of the changes in fair value of investment properties based on Real Property Gains Tax ("RPGT"). The final tax outcome could be different from the deferred tax liabilities recognised in the financial statements should the economic benefits embodied in the investment properties be subsequently substantially consumed over time rather than through sale.

# 3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Group and the Company apply the material accounting policies, as summarised below, consistently throughout all years presented in the financial statements, unless otherwise stated.

# 3.1 Business combinations

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method from the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group, except for Allied Engineering Construction Sdn. Bhd., URC Engineering Sdn. Bhd. and UOA Properties Sdn. Bhd., which are consolidated using the merger method of accounting.

Under the merger method of accounting, the results of entities or businesses under common control are accounted for as if the acquisition had occurred at the date that common control was established. The cost of an acquisition is measured at the nominal value of ordinary shares issued as consideration. The assets and liabilities acquired are included in the consolidated statement of financial position at their existing carrying amounts.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024 (Continued)

# 3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# 3.2 Property, plant and equipment

All property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and less any impairment losses.

Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group and the Company.

Depreciation is recognised on the straight-line method in order to write off the cost of each asset over its estimated useful life. Freehold land with an infinite life is not depreciated.

The principal annual depreciation rates used are as follows:

<table><tr><td>Leasehold land</td><td>Over the period of the lease</td></tr><tr><td>Leasehold buildings</td><td>2%</td></tr><tr><td>Freehold buildings</td><td>2%</td></tr><tr><td>Plant, machineries and motor vehicles</td><td>10% - 20%</td></tr><tr><td>Furniture, fittings and equipment</td><td>10% - 20%</td></tr></table>

Fully depreciated assets are retained in the financial statements until they are no longer in use and no further charge for depreciation is made in respect of these assets.

# 3.3 Investment properties

Investment properties are measured at fair value and are revalued annually and are included in the statements of financial position at their open market values.

If the fair value of an investment property under construction is not reliably measurable but the Group expects the fair value of the investment property to be reliably measurable when construction is complete, that investment property under construction is measured at cost until either its fair value becomes reliably measurable or construction is completed (whichever is earlier).

# 3.4 Leases

# 3.4.1 As a lessee

The Group and the Company apply a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Group and the Company recognise lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.

# Short-term lease

The Group and the Company apply the short-term lease recognition exemption to their short-term leases (i.e. those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). Lease payments on short-term leases are recognised as expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

# Right-of-use assets

Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:

Leasehold land 99 years  
Leasehold buildings - 50 years  
Motor vehicles - 5 to 10 years  
• Plant and machineries 
• - 5 to 10 years

# 3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# 3.5 Inventories

Costs of consumables and medicinal products are determined on first in first out method.

# 3.6 Financial instruments

A financial instrument is any contract that give rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.

Financial assets at amortised cost

The Group's and the Company's financial assets at amortised cost include trade and other receivables, amounts owing by ultimate holding company, subsidiary companies, related companies and cash and cash equivalents.

Financial assets designated at fair value through other comprehensive income (equity instruments)

The Group and the Company elected to classify irrevocably their equity investments under financial assets designated at fair value through other comprehensive income (equity instruments).

Financial liabilities at amortised cost

The Group's and the Company's financial liabilities at amortised cost include trade and other payables, amounts owing to immediate holding company, subsidiary companies, related companies, non-controlling shareholders of subsidiary companies, lease liabilities and borrowings.

# 3.7 Revenue recognition

Revenue from contracts with customers

The Group recognises revenue from property development and constructions over time if it creates an asset with no alternative use to the Group and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. Revenue is recognised over the period of the contract by reference to the progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation.

The progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation is measured based on the Group's efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of the performance obligation (e.g. by reference to the property development or contract costs incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total development or contract costs of the contract, i.e. the stage of completion).

Revenue from sales of completed properties is recognised upon delivery of properties where the control of the properties or land has passed to the buyers.

All the revenue from hotel room income, food and beverage and other related income, healthcare, medicinal, physiotherapy, acupuncture, dental consultancy and treatment and other healthcare related services, course fees from provision of education, training services and related consultancy services income are recognised when their services are rendered.

Sale of medicinal, pharmaceuticals, healthcare and beauty care products income are recognised when the goods are delivered.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024 (Continued)

# 3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# 3.7 Revenue recognition (continued)

Other revenue recognition

Other revenue earned by the Group and the Company are recognised on the following bases:-

- Management fee income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.  
Distribution income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.  
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.  
- Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis.

# 3.8 Tax expense

Deferred tax assets

A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

Deferred tax liabilities

Where investment properties are carried at their fair value, the amount of deferred tax recognised is measured using the tax rates that would apply on sale of those assets at their carrying values at the reporting date unless the property is depreciable and is held with the objective to consume substantially all of the economic benefits embodied in the property over time, rather than through sale. In all other cases, the amount of deferred tax recognised is measured based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of the asset and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

The Group's investment properties comprise freehold condominium and apartment, freehold commercial properties, leasehold commercial properties and properties under construction.

Some investment properties as at 31 December 2024 are stated at fair value by reference to a full valuation conducted by a registered independent valuer having appropriate recognised professional qualifications for certain investment properties and some based on an assessment by the Board of Directors by obtaining update valuations for investment properties that did not have a full valuation conducted.

The fair value represents the amount at which the properties could be exchanged on an open market basis between a knowledgeable willing buyer and a knowledgeable willing seller in an arm's length transaction at the reporting date.

Whilst a full valuation has not been conducted for certain investment properties, the Board of Directors have obtained updated market values of the investment properties as at 31 December 2024 carried out by a firm of independent professional valuers who has appropriate professional qualification and recent experience in the relevant location and assets being valued. For investment properties where the assessment by the Board of Directors were based on updated valuations, the existing book values of the investment properties as at 31 December 2024 ("Book Values") were not materially different from the updated valuations performed.

In view of the above and taking into account current market conditions, the Board of Directors assessed that the Book Values are fair. Hence, the Book Values were not adjusted and were taken to represent the fair values of the investment properties at the same date.

The fair values of the investment properties were determined using comparison method, cost method or investment method.

The following assumptions have been applied in the valuations:

(i) The comparison method entails comparing the property with comparable properties which have been sold or are being offered for sale and making adjustments for factors which affect value such as location and accessibility, size, building construction and finishes, building services, management and maintenance, age and state of repair, market conditions and other relevant characteristics.  
(ii) Under the cost method, the value of the land is added to the replacement cost of the buildings and other site improvements. The replacement cost of the buildings is derived from estimation of reproduction cost of similar new buildings based on current market prices for materials, labour and present construction techniques and deducting therefrom the accrued depreciation due to use and disrepair, age and obsolescence through technology and market changes.  
(iii) The investment method entails the determination of the probable gross annual rental the property is capable of producing and deducting therefrom the outgoings to arrive at the annual net income.

The fair values of investment properties classified under level 2 were determined using comparison method and level 3 were determined using cost or investment method.

There has been no change in valuation methods used during the financial year.

The properties under construction are measured at cost because the fair value is not yet determinable as of 31 December 2024. The fair value of the properties is expected to be reliably determinable when the construction is complete.

The increase of trade receivables was due to significant progress in development properties which met the conditions for the billing to issue in accordance to the sale and purchase agreements signed with customers.

Contract assets increase as a result of the significant progress in development properties over the billings issued to customers.

Contract liabilities increase due to advance billing to customers over the revenue recognition as at the reporting date. There were no contract liabilities in the previous year presented and no revenue was recognised from performance obligations satisfied in previous years.

# 29.3 Performance obligations

# Sale of properties and construction contracts

For sale of development properties under construction and construction contracts, the performance obligation is satisfied over time as the Group's performance does not create an asset with an alternative use and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.

For the sale of completed properties, the performance obligation is satisfied upon delivery of the properties or when control of the land has been passed to the buyer.

The payment terms for progress billings made to purchasers are disclosed in Notes 11 and 15 to the Financial Statements.

The nature of the properties that the Group has promised to transfer to purchasers are residential houses and commercial units/buildings.

The Group's properties are subject to a defects liability period of generally twenty-four (24) months from the delivery of vacant possession. This requires the Group to rectify any defects which may appear and which are due to design, materials, goods, workmanship or equipment that are not in accordance with the sale and purchase agreement.

# 39. MATERIAL LITIGATIONS

On 31 December 2018, two of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary companies, namely Windsor Triumph Sdn. Bhd. ("Windsor") and Sunny Uptown Sdn. Bhd. ("Sunny") were served by the Inland Revenue Board of Malaysia ("IRB") with Notices of Additional Assessment for the Year of Assessment 2013, for additional income tax totalling RM25,558,750.50 and penalties totalling RM14,057,312.78 ("Cases").

The additional assessment raised against Windsor by IRB arose from an adjustment by IRB of the market value of property that Windsor had withdrawn as an inventory to hold as investment property, whereas the additional assessment raised against Sunny by IRB arose from an adjustment by IRB of the selling price at market value of properties that Sunny had assigned to another wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group on an "as is" basis.

Both subsidiary companies relied on valuations by a professional, independent and experienced registered valuer. These valuations were adjusted by IRB by substituting them with valuations subsequently conducted by Jabatan Penilaian dan Perkhidmatan Harta.

On 1 August 2023, Windsor had entered into a Settlement Agreement with IRB to agree on the additional income tax of RM4,325,000. Windsor had on 31 August 2023 agreed to discontinue the appeal and each party shall undertake to do the necessary to give full effect to the Agreement, whereas all excess income tax paid by Windsor shall be refunded within a reasonable period of time.

On 5 February 2024, Sunny had entered into a Settlement Agreement with IRB to agree on the additional income tax of RM1,122,500 and penalty of RM617,375 totalling RM1,739,875.

The amounts of the additional income tax and penalty for both of the companies have been recognised in profit or loss in the respective financial year.

In view of the above, the Directors are of the opinion that the additional income taxes and penalty charge had been appropriately taken up in the financial statements and no additional provisions in respect of the tax liabilities and penalty in dispute are required to be made in the financial statements as at the reporting date.

Transactions between segments were entered into in the normal course of business and were established on terms and conditions that are not materially different from that obtainable in transactions with unrelated parties. The effects of such inter-segmental transactions are eliminated on consolidation.

The operations of the Group are wholly carried out in Malaysia. Group income taxes are presented on a group basis and are not allocated to operating segments.

There is no significant concentration of revenue from any major customers as the Group sells its development properties to various purchasers.

FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024 (Continued)

# 43. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES

The Group and the Company are exposed to financial risks arising from their operations and the use of financial instruments. Financial risk management policies are established to ensure that adequate resources are available for the development of the Group's and the Company's businesses whilst managing its risks. The Group and the Company operate within clearly defined policies and procedures that are approved by the Board of Directors to ensure the effectiveness of the risk management process.

The main areas of financial risks faced by the Group and the Company and the policies in respect of the major areas of treasury activity are set out as follows:

# (a) Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of a financial loss to the Group and the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. It is the Group's and the Company's policy to enter into financial instruments with a diversity of creditworthy counterparties. The Group and the Company do not expect to incur material credit losses of its financial assets or other financial instruments.

Concentration of credit risk exists when changes in economic, industry and geographical factors similarly affect the group of counterparties whose aggregate credit exposure is significant in relation to the Group's and the Company's total credit exposure. The Group's and the Company's portfolio of financial instruments is broadly diversified and transactions are entered into with diverse creditworthy counterparties, thereby mitigate any significant concentration of credit risk.

The Group's and the Company's objective are to seek continual revenue growth while minimising losses incurred due to increase credit risk exposure. The Group and the Company extend credit only to recognised and creditworthy third parties. It is the Group's and the Company's policy that all customers are subject to credit verification procedures. In addition, receivables balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group's and the Company's exposure to bad debts is not significant.

# i. Receivables and contract assets

In respect of trade receivables arising from the sale of the Group's development properties, the Group mitigates any credit risk it may have by maintaining its name as the registered owner of the development properties until full settlement by the purchasers of the self-financed portion of the purchase consideration and upon undertaking of end-financing by the purchaser's end-financier.

In respect of the Group's investment properties and tenanted unsold inventories, the Group customarily obtains three months' rental deposit from tenants as security for the performance of their obligations under the tenancy agreements to mitigate the risk of non-collectability of monthly rentals.

An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date using a provision matrix to measure expected credit losses. The provision rates are based on days past due for groupings of various customer segments with similar loss patterns (i.e. customer type and rating and coverage by collateral). The calculation reflects the probability-weighted outcome, the time value of money and reasonable and supportable information that is available at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.

# 43. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES (CONTINUED)

The main areas of financial risks faced by the Group and the Company and the policies in respect of the major areas of treasury activity are set out as follows (continued):

# (a) Credit risk (continued)

# i. Receivables and contract assets (continued)

Generally, trade receivables are written off if the Directors deem them uncollectable. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets.

Collateral is considered an integral part of trade receivables and considered in the calculation of impairment. At the reporting date, all of the Group's trade receivables are covered by collateral other than the trade receivables that are credit impaired. As such, no expected credit losses are required as at reporting date for trade receivables that are covered by collateral. The Group evaluates the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables and contract assets as low, as trade receivables consists of a large number of customers in various backgrounds.

Receivables that are individually determined to be credit impaired at the financial year end relate to debtors who are in significant financial difficulties and had defaulted on payments.

FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024 (Continued)

# 43. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES (CONTINUED)

The main areas of financial risks faced by the Group and the Company and the policies in respect of the major areas of treasury activity are set out as follows (continued):

# (a) Credit risk (continued)

# i. Receivables and contract assets (continued)

Other receivables

The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by their carrying amounts in the statements of financial position.

# ii. Intercompanies balances

The maximum exposure to credit risk for intercompanies balances is represented by their carrying amounts in the statements of financial position.

The Group and the Company has management fee receivable, progress billing receivables and also provide unsecured advances to ultimate holding, subsidiary and related companies and monitors the results of these companies regularly. As at the reporting date, there was no indication that the management fee receivable, progress billing receivables and the advances to these companies are not recoverable.

# iii. Financial institutions and cash deposits

Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Group's treasury department in accordance with the Group's policy. Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties.

# iv. Financial guarantees

The maximum exposure to credit risk by the Company amounted to RM74,634,000 (2023: RM51,566,000), represented by the bank guarantees and outstanding banking facilities utilised by the subsidiary companies as at the end of the reporting year.

The Company provides unsecured financial guarantees to banks in respect of banking facilities granted to certain subsidiary companies. The Company monitors on an on-going basis the results of the subsidiary companies and repayments made by the subsidiary companies. As at the end of the reporting year, there was no indication that any subsidiary company would default on repayment.

Financial guarantees have not been recognised since the fair value on initial recognition was not material.

# v. Investments and other financial assets

At the end of the reporting year, the Group and the Company have investments in domestic securities. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amounts in the statements of financial position.

Significant investments are allowed only in liquid securities and only with counterparties that have good credit ratings.

The Group's and the Company's maximum exposure to credit risk for the components of the statements of financial position at the reporting date are their carrying amounts.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024 (Continued)

# 43. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES (CONTINUED)

The main areas of financial risks faced by the Group and the Company and the policies in respect of the major areas of treasury activity are set out as follows (continued):

# (b) Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of the Group's and the Company's financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.

The Group's and the Company's investments in fixed rate debt securities and fixed rate borrowings are exposed to a risk of change in their fair values due to changes in interest rates. The Group's variable rate borrowings are exposed to a risk of change in cash flows due to changes in interest rates. Short-term receivables and payables are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk.

The interest rate profile of the Group's and the Company's significant interest-bearing financial instruments, based on carrying amounts as at the end of the reporting year is as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">Group</td><td colspan="2">Company</td></tr><tr><td>2024 RM’000</td><td>2023 RM’000</td><td>2024 RM’000</td><td>2023 RM’000</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed rate instruments</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Fixed deposits with licensed banks</td><td>233,380</td><td>206,106</td><td>52,945</td><td>33,008</td></tr><tr><td>Lease liabilities</td><td>1,065</td><td>431</td><td>-</td><td>259</td></tr><tr><td>Borrowings</td><td>167</td><td>212</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr></table>

The Group and the Company do not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, and the Group and the Company do not designate derivatives as hedging instruments under a fair value hedge accounting model. Therefore, a change in interest rates at the end of the reporting year would not affect profit or loss.

# (c) Market risk

The Group's and the Company's principal exposure to market risk arises from changes in value caused by movements in market prices of their quoted equity investments. The risk of loss is minimised via thorough analysis before investing and continuous monitoring of the performance of the investments.

Common to all businesses, the overall performance of the Group's and the Company's investments are also driven externally by global and domestic economies that are largely unpredictable and uncontrollable.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024 (Continued)

# 43. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES (CONTINUED)

The main areas of financial risks faced by the Group and the Company and the policies in respect of the major areas of treasury activity are set out as follows (continued):

# (d) Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group or the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as and when they fall due, due to shortage of funds.

The Group and the Company seek to ensure all business units maintain optimum levels of liquidity at all times, sufficient for their operating, investing and financing activities.

Therefore, the policy seeks to ensure that each business unit, through efficient working capital management (i.e. inventories, accounts receivable and accounts payable management), must be able to convert its current assets into cash to meet all demands for payment as and when they fall due.

Owing to the nature of the businesses, the Group and the Company seek to maintain sufficient credit lines available to meet the liquidity requirements while ensuring an effective working capital management within the Group and the Company.

The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group's and the Company's financial liabilities at the reporting date based on contractual undiscounted repayment obligations:

* This exposure to liquidity risk is included for illustration purpose only as the related guarantees have not yet crystallised

# (e) Foreign currency risk

Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.

The Company is exposed to foreign currency risk on fixed deposits with licensed banks that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Company. The currency giving rise to this risk is primarily Australian Dollar ("AUD").

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024 (Continued)

# 43. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES (CONTINUED)

The main areas of financial risks faced by the Group and the Company and the policies in respect of the major areas of treasury activity are set out as follows (continued):

# (e) Foreign currency risk (continued)

The Company's exposure to foreign currency risk, based on carrying amounts at the end of the reporting date were as follows:-

<table><tr><td></td><td colspan="2">Group and Company</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2024</td><td>2023</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>RM&#x27;000</td><td>RM&#x27;000</td></tr><tr><td>Denominated in AUD</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Fixed deposits with licensed banks</td><td>25,481</td><td>27,587</td></tr></table>

A  $11.34\%$  (2023:  $3.98\%$ ) strengthening of the AUD against the functional currency of the Group and of the Company at the end of reporting period would increase or decrease profit for the financial year/total equity as shown in the table below, this analysis assumes that all other variables held constant.

<table><tr><td></td><td colspan="2">Group and Company</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2024</td><td>2023</td></tr><tr><td>AUD/RM</td><td>RM’000</td><td>RM’000</td></tr><tr><td>Increase/(Decrease)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Profit for the financial year/Total equity</td><td>2,890</td><td>1,098</td></tr></table>

A  $11.34\%$  (2023:  $3.98\%$ ) weakening of the AUD against the functional currency of the Group at the end of reporting period would have equal but opposite effect to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables held constant.

# 44. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

The Group's objectives when managing capital is to maintain a strong capital base and safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business. The Directors monitor and determine an optimal debt-to-equity ratio that complies with debt covenants and regulatory requirements.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024 (Continued)

# 44. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)

The Group's strategy is to maintain the debt-to-equity ratio between  $10\%$  to  $25\%$ . The debt-to-equity ratio at the reporting date is as follows:

<table><tr><td></td><td>2024
RM’000</td><td>2023
RM’000</td></tr><tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents</td><td>1,800,001</td><td>1,845,952</td></tr><tr><td>Less: total borrowings</td><td>(1,232)</td><td>(643)</td></tr><tr><td>Net cash available</td><td>1,798,769</td><td>1,845,309</td></tr><tr><td>Equity attributable to the owners of the Company</td><td>5,661,878</td><td>5,413,096</td></tr><tr><td>Debt-to-equity ratio (%)</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr></table>

There were no changes in the Group's approach to capital management during the financial year.

# 45. FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

The Group has established policies and procedures in respect of the fair value measurement.

Financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis

Certain financial assets of the Group and the Company are measured at fair value at the end of the reporting year. Details of fair value measurement of those financial assets are as follows:

<table><tr><td></td><td colspan="2">Fair value</td><td>Fair value hierarchy</td><td>Valuation method and key inputs</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2024</td><td>2023</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>RM’000</td><td>RM’000</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Group</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Equity investments</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Quoted shares in Malaysia</td><td>76,681</td><td>87,105</td><td>Level 1</td><td>Quoted bid price in active market</td></tr><tr><td>Unquoted shares in Malaysia</td><td>100</td><td>100</td><td>Level 3</td><td>Carrying value deemed fair value</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>76,781</td><td>87,205</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Company</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Equity investments</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Quoted shares in Malaysia</td><td>17,787</td><td>17,445</td><td>Level 1</td><td>Quoted bid price in active market</td></tr></table>

There is no transfer between the fair value hierarchies during the financial year.

The carrying amounts of other financial assets and financial liabilities of the Group and of the Company at the reporting date approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature or immaterial discounting impact.

The Board through the Nomination and Remuneration Committee ("NRC") of the Company had undertaken an annual assessment on the Executive Director, Ms. Ang Kheng Im, and Independent Non-Executive Director, Mr. Eugene Lee Chin Jin, both of whom are seeking re-election pursuant to Clause 100 of the Company's Constitution.

# NOTICE OF THE TWENTY-FIRST ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING

(Continued)

3. Resolution 6 - Authority to Issue Shares pursuant to Section 75 and 76 of the Companies Act 2016

The proposed Resolution 6 will give the Directors of the Company the flexibility to issue and allot new shares in the Company up to an amount not exceeding in total  $10\%$  of the issued share capital of the Company for such purposes as the Directors consider would be in the interest of the Company.

The Company continues to consider opportunities to enhance the earnings potential of the Company and if such opportunities involve the issuance of new shares, the Directors would have to convene a general meeting to approve the issuance of new shares even though the number involved may be less than  $10\%$  of the issued share capital. In order to avoid any delay and costs involved in convening a general meeting to approve the issuance of new shares, it is thus considered appropriate that the Directors be empowered to issue new shares in the Company, up to an amount not exceeding in total  $10\%$  of the issued share capital of the Company at any time, for such purposes.

The authority for the allotment of new shares will provide flexibility to the Company for any potential fund-raising activities, including but not limited to placement of shares, for purpose of funding future investments, working capital and/or acquisition. This authority will expire at the next AGM, unless revoked or varied at a general meeting. As at the date of this notice, there were no shares issued pursuant to the mandate obtained in the last AGM.

4. Resolution 7 - Authority to Issue Shares pursuant to the DRS

The proposed Resolution 7 will give the Directors of the Company the authority to allot and issue new shares in the Company for the DRS in respect of the dividend declared at this AGM and subsequently until the next AGM.

5. Resolution 8, Resolution 9 and Resolution 10 - General Mandate for Recurrent Related Party Transactions

The proposed Resolution 8, 9, and 10, if passed, will allow the Company and its subsidiary companies to enter into recurrent related party transactions of a revenue and trading nature. The details of these proposals are set out in the Circular to Shareholders dated 29 April 2025, which is despatched together with the Annual Report for the financial year ended 31 December 2024.

6. Resolution 11 - Proposed Renewal of Share Buy-Back Authority

The proposed Resolution 11, if passed, will empower the Directors to buy-back and/or hold up to a maximum of  $10\%$  of the total number of issued shares (excluding treasury shares) of the Company at the time of purchase. Details of this proposal is set out in the Circular to Shareholders dated 29 April 2025, which is despatched together with the Annual Report for the financial year ended 31 December 2024.
