# About Us

Gas Malaysia Berhad ("Gas Malaysia" or "the Group") was established on 16 May 1992. The Group's primary business focus is selling, marketing, and distributing natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers as well as developing, operating, and maintaining the Natural Gas Distribution System ("NGDS") within Peninsular Malaysia. With the total market liberalisation of the gas industry for the non-power sector initiated in 2022 under the Third-Party Access ("TPA") framework, the competitive landscape of the gas supply industry saw enhancement. This is a year of learning for Gas Malaysia and other industry players. We further strengthened our position in the industry value chain to prepare ourselves for full market liberalisation by successfully unbundling our business operations into two (2) separate entities.

These two (2) entities, Gas Malaysia Distribution Sdn Bhd ("GMD") and Gas Malaysia Energy and Services Sdn Bhd ("GMES"), are wholly owned by Gas Malaysia and were awarded a distribution licence and shipping licence, respectively, from the regulator. GMD was granted a 20-year distribution licence, which allows it to take up the role of a gas distributor through its 2,839 kilometres of NGDS in Peninsular Malaysia. GMD also develops, operates and maintains the NGDS to ensure the safe and reliable delivery of gas to customers across Peninsular Malaysia.

GMES, meanwhile, was granted a 10-year shipping and importation licence, and will operate as a gas shipper, since the licences enable GMES to procure gas from gas suppliers and arrange gas delivery per with customer requirements. This allows GMES to arrange a regasification, transportation or distribution licensee for gas to be processed or delivered to consumers' premises.

Serving as a key driver for the Group's sustainable growth, we supply natural gas to 1,042 industrial customers. In an effort to broaden our reach, we extend our services by supplying natural gas as well as Liquefied Petroleum Gas ("LPG") to 1,992 commercial customers and 21,847 residential customers.

The Group also has smaller operations in the simultaneous generation and sale of electricity and steam, the distribution via land transportation of Compressed Natural Gas ("CNG"), and the distribution via land transportation of Bio Compressed Natural Gas ("BioCNG") derived from Palm Oil Mill Effluent ("POME"). These businesses are represented by our subsidiaries and joint-venture companies, Gas Malaysia Energy Advance Sdn Bhd, Gas Malaysia Green Ventures Sdn Bhd (formerly known as Gas Malaysia Virtual Pipeline Sdn Bhd), and Gas Malaysia Synergy Drive Sdn Bhd. We remain focused on creating new demand for natural gas and fulfilling customers' energy requirements, ultimately expanding our customer base to ensure sustainable growth.

A series of impactful local and international events have significantly shaped the trajectory of our gas industry in 2023. The elevated crude oil price environment has helped to bolster our income growth, despite partial offsets in the form of deceleration in the manufacturing sector and weaker external demand.

# INVESTOR RELATIONS COMMUNICATION AND ENGAGEMENT WITH STAKEHOLDERS

Our Investor Relations ("IR") strategy is primarily structured to achieve fair valuation. We are focused on articulating the company's financial performance, long-term strategic plans and competitive positioning. This includes having an understanding of our audience, specifically institutional shareholders, potential investors, analysts and other stakeholders as well as customising our messaging and outreach accordingly.

Customising our engagement calendar according to our overall strategy. We strived to keep it simple and focused while improving disclosure in an understandable manner to help investors track the execution of the company's goals, while building credibility and fostering long-lasting relationships with them.

Building and nurturing relationships with both internal and external stakeholders is critical to our IR strategy success, as is clear and regular communication. Internal stakeholders should understand the external expectations of the company's performance and how their work is tied to achieving the firm's long-term strategic plan. External stakeholders, especially investors and analysts, should receive clear and transparent communications regularly.

Our active engagements through calls and meetings provide an opportunity to respond to questions and concerns while simultaneously providing an opportunity to seek valuable feedback. This enables the constant monitoring of the investors perceptions of the company.

We continue to adopt the hybrid approach for all our engagements in 2023.

# Message from the Chairman

Chaiting Paths Towards Greater Progress

# DEAR VALUED SHAREHOLDERS,

I am honoured to represent the Board in presenting the 2023 Annual Report of Gas Malaysia Berhad ("Gas Malaysia" or "the Group"), covering the period from 1 January to 31 December 2023 ("FYE 2023"). This report highlights our commitment to fostering long-term, sustainable value for our stakeholders.

Throughout 2023, we have demonstrated resilience and continued delivering value, upheld by our dedication to operational excellence, producing world-class reliability, strengthening our core and non-core businesses and improving service excellence to our customers.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/307b6151-d5a6-4681-b010-4bcec09b04f5/5c7fd0152763fd79f5bae435d88245c08c9c525607576e8ca9bfe6328367b6bb.jpg)

# OVERVIEW OF 2023

In 2023, the world continued to be impacted by inflationary pressures even as global economies were anticipating a solid recovery in economic growth. The rapid interest rate hikes by the United States of America and other advanced economies to tame inflation slowed global economic growth while geopolitical tensions created further uncertainty.

Domestically, Malaysia's economy experienced a period of high inflation but has remained resilient overall, although some export-oriented industries were impacted given Malaysia's status as a trading nation. According to Bank Negara Malaysia, Gross Domestic Product ("GDP") expanded by  $3.7\%$  in 2023, which was lower than forecasts made earlier. Although GDP growth was slower compared to 2022's performance of  $8.7\%$ , the economy continued to be supported by strong domestic demand.

For Gas Malaysia, we experienced some headwinds as demand for gas from the rubber glove sector fell as the global demand for rubber gloves declined in 2023. The Group mitigated this challenge through its flexible pricing mechanism and our commitment to operational and customer service excellence. In addition, government policies such as the National Energy Policy 2022-2040 ("NEP") and the recently launched National Energy Transition Roadmap ("NETR"), which have indicated the importance of natural gas in transitioning to a low-carbon economy, uplifted industry prospects.

# Message from the Chairman

# SUSTAINING EXCELLENCE, GUIDED BY A NEW STRATEGY

In 2023, we remained committed to expanding access to natural gas through the growth of our Natural Gas Distribution System ("NGDS") pipeline network and marketing initiatives to bring more customers into our fold. We have also strived to ensure our business continues to deliver the level of service that our customers have come to expect, especially in terms of reliability. Taking this a step further, we have also improved our service culture to ensure that customer-centricity always takes centre stage.

As for our other businesses adjacent the gas value chain, we have made further progress by operationalising a cogeneration plant in support of the low-carbon agenda. Our biogas and biomethane business has also progressed well, with the successful commissioning of two (2) key projects that enabled us to inject biomethane into our NGDS.

Most significantly, we have moved forward this year by introducing Gas Malaysia's new strategic plan, GM32, which aims to strengthen our existing business and guide our foray into new business portfolios within the gas value chain. Through five (5) strategic pillars, this plan will catalyse Gas Malaysia to be a vertically integrated gas player with a regional presence and diversified portfolios. The GM32 strategic plan aligns with our four (4) sustainability pillars — advancing environmental sustainability, strengthening business delivery, fostering a people-centric organisation, and enhancing governance and transparency.

We have taken this approach to our business as we recognise that natural gas is set to continue to grow in importance as the nation transitions to a low-carbon economy. While this plays to our core strength, we must future-proof the organisation. This is particularly evident in the context of market liberalisation, which has spurred greater competition and prompted us to look to other avenues of growth to ensure our business remains sustainable.

# CHARTING NEW HEIGHTS IN OUR SUSTAINABILITY JOURNEY

Gas Malaysia is dedicated to integrating sustainable practices across all its operations, aiming to generate a lasting impact and enduring value for our stakeholders. In 2023, Gas Malaysia launched a new Sustainability Framework anchored on four (4) key sustainability pillars and nine (9) strategies. These are further aligned with five (5) key United Nations Sustainable Development Goals ("UNSDGs") and are also aimed at supporting the nation's sustainability agenda and policies.

We also enhanced the Sustainability Governance Structure to ensure that our business operations align seamlessly with our commitments to sustainability. This revised governance structure distinctly defines the responsibilities and duties of the Board and Management, incorporating a more efficient process for disclosures. This refinement in our approach guarantees precise and transparent reporting of our progress in sustainability.

In line with Malaysia's objective of achieving net zero emissions by 2050, Gas Malaysia strives to reach net zero emissions for Scope 1 and 2. We will continue to decarbonise our operations and foster a transition to cleaner energy in alignment with the national agenda and our commitment to a sustainable future.

# ELEVATING CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Our commitment to corporate governance is founded on integrity and ethical conduct. Our Board of Directors and management team have continually reinforced this commitment, ensuring that our strategies, policies and procedures evolve to meet the demands of a dynamic marketplace. This emphasis on ethical governance is about adhering to standards and about fostering a culture of transparency and accountability across the organisation. A key outcome in this area in 2023 was the Group receiving the ISO 37001:2016 Anti-Bribery Management Systems certification, which brings closure to an effort that began in 2022 and underscores our commitment to maintaining high standards of integrity.

Recognising the necessity for new skills to achieve our objectives, we embarked on a comprehensive programme that will advance talent development, succession planning and the recruitment of required talents. We have also developed a Culture Activation framework to further align the workforce with our Purpose and to instil a high-performance culture within Gas Malaysia.

# FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

For the FYE 2023, Gas Malaysia's revenue reached RM8.08 billion, marking a  $6\%$  increase from the RM7.65 billion recorded in the previous year. This rise was achieved despite a decrease in the volume of natural gas sold, primarily due to the elevated average selling price of natural gas in 2023.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/307b6151-d5a6-4681-b010-4bcec09b04f5/4b5aa3f9ee1f3cdbb2afaf21e1be3fc402362461b44190311da636fb5228239a.jpg)

Profit after zakat and taxation for the same period was RM383.4 million, a  $2\%$  decrease from RM389.5 million in the previous year. This decline was largely due to the reduced volume of natural gas sold, coupled with increased operating and administrative expenses and declined contributions from joint venture companies. However, this was balanced by a rise in finance income during the year.

# ENVISIONING THE FUTURE

We look forward to its completion as it is one (1) of our longest expansion projects, spanning over 60 kilometres in total, and is aimed at helping to jumpstart the automotive industry at the Automotive High-Tech Valley.

Subsequently, our focus will remain on harnessing the opportunities we have outlined in our GM32 strategy to deliver value for our stakeholders. Given the importance of gas in Malaysia's transition journey, we are relatively optimistic about our prospects for the future. We will fully support the government's agenda as outlined in the NETR and the National Energy Policy 2022-2040. As highlighted in the NETR, gas is expected to contribute to  $56\%$  of the energy mix. In this context, we have made our intention to contribute to the growth of gas over the long term very clear, following our recent announcement to expand the NGDS by an additional 800 kilometres within the next five (5) years (from 2024 to 2028).

DEAR VALUED SHAREHOLDERS,

The year 2023 began positively in anticipation of a robust economic recovery as the world moved on entirely from the pandemic. Domestically, Malaysia's economic growth was moderate as a result of softer demand for exports. While this impacted demand for gas to some extent, the higher average price of natural gas in 2023, due to the volatility in the oil market from the ongoing geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and the Middle East, mitigated it.

# Revenue

Gas Malaysia's revenue rose to RM8.08 billion in 2023, a  $6\%$  increase from the RM7.65 billion recorded in 2022. The growth was mainly driven by the higher average natural gas selling price mitigated by lower volume of natural gas sold during the year.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/307b6151-d5a6-4681-b010-4bcec09b04f5/9640a4deaa0bda671fd81c6493185b27ab6c363d1602eb4163bab3d7e3881200.jpg)

# Cost and Expenses

Total costs and expenses for the Group increased by  $7\%$  in 2023, reaching RM7.58 billion, up from RM7.11 billion in 2022. This was primarily due to the rise in gas costs, which accounted for about  $96\%$  of total expenses, in line with higher average natural gas purchase price. Further increase was from additional expenses including depreciation and amortisation, predominantly associated with the NGDS, alongside human capital and maintenance costs to keep the NGDS performance optimal.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/307b6151-d5a6-4681-b010-4bcec09b04f5/99946be84edc5964d2a2d9f92b2600c802a3c231172621344c6b644230430f43.jpg)

# Earnings Before Interest Income, Taxes, Zakat, Depreciation and Amortisation ("EBITZDA")

EBITZDA saw a decrease to RM603.4 million in 2023, a drop from RM636.9 million recorded the previous year. This decline was primarily due to a lower gross profit and higher administrative expenses. The reduced gross profit was in line with an increase in operating expenses.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/307b6151-d5a6-4681-b010-4bcec09b04f5/86f6dc9ace5ee3e647ab4a7dd02355d83cf84dc46d255aec86b115628d184c54.jpg)

# Finance Costs

The Group incurred finance costs of RM11.1 million in 2023, attributed to Islamic Medium-Term Notes ("IMTN") and Islamic Commercial Papers ("ICP"). These instruments were primarily used for financing capital expenditure projects.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/307b6151-d5a6-4681-b010-4bcec09b04f5/5ca5a343cf96bdff4634f0b49bdafa7398df2c8d062f823fe192319ceb192b13.jpg)

# Taxation

For the FYE 2023, the Group's tax expenses totalled RM131.7 million, lower than RM153.7 million in 2022. This decrease was in line with a lower pre-tax profit for the year and the impact of the Cukai Makmur in 2022.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/307b6151-d5a6-4681-b010-4bcec09b04f5/764f022b5aedac984222ec5400819ee7ccdf9f274dc8c4d292c1648ef000966a.jpg)

# Profit After Zakat and Tax ("PAZT")

The Group's PAZT declined slightly to RM383.4 million in 2023, compared to RM389.5 million in 2022. This decrease aligned with the lower EBITZDA recorded for the year, partially offset by higher finance income and reduced taxation.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/307b6151-d5a6-4681-b010-4bcec09b04f5/839723d1a03bf3593a52b177f7ee1f3e65efda7f8a085062a080d68147cfe7fe.jpg)

# Gearing Ratio

The gross gearing ratio rose to  $20\%$ , compared to  $16\%$  in the previous year, due to net issuance of RM89 million from the Sukuk programme to partly finance capital expenditure projects, in line with the Group's ongoing commitment to expand the NGDS network.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/307b6151-d5a6-4681-b010-4bcec09b04f5/336f4e43f49f37ac5fc68fd85d844d79b406272bea328ca64614e19bfb10344d.jpg)

# Capital Expenditure

Capital expenditure for the year was RM218.9 million, primarily for construction projects to expand the NGDS network and various non-NGDS projects. NGDS projects were specifically focused on constructing gas pipelines and metering stations, while non-NGDS projects included purchasing gas and office equipment, digitalisation efforts and motor vehicles.

# PRIORITISING THE LOW-CARBON AGENDA

Amid escalating concerns about climate change, renewable energy has become essential for reducing carbon emissions, aligning with Malaysia's Renewable Energy Roadmap ("MyRER") and the country's goals of attaining  $31\%$  renewable energy capacity by 2025 and  $40\%$  by 2035.

Gas Malaysia has actively pursued opportunities within the gas industry's value chain to support this low-carbon objective. The Group's initiatives have led to the development of businesses in cogeneration plants, biogas, biomethane production and virtual pipelines for delivering compressed natural gas to remote areas, all contributing to cleaner energy sources.

# COGENERATION PLANTS

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/307b6151-d5a6-4681-b010-4bcec09b04f5/64d7d39020acf80472f4975591479f00f58c758a66002c6dabb4cffc9759fc80.jpg)

Gas Malaysia continues to expand its Combined Heat and Power ("CHP") portfolio, enhancing our role as a provider of innovative energy solutions. Also known as cogeneration, this process involves simultaneously generating electricity and usable heat from natural gas combustion, leading to improved system efficiency. We own cogeneration plants in the Northern and Central regions through GMEA.

In December 2023, GMEA commenced operations of a gas turbine cogeneration plant for Fatty Chemical (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd in the Prai Industrial Area, Penang. With a capacity to

generate 6.7 MW of electricity and 35 tph of steam, the plant is expected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions significantly.

In addition, operations for a cogeneration plant for Sime Darby Plantation Berhad in Selangor, constructed by GMSD, started in February 2023. This plant generates 2.3 MW of electricity and 20 tph of steam, contributing to a notable reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.

Amid escalating concerns regarding climate change, the imperative for renewable energy sources and sustainability has become increasingly apparent as a key component in the energy mix playing a crucial role in reducing carbon emissions. In reflection of our efforts, our wholly-owned subsidiary GMGV, has successfully commissioned two (2) Biomethane Entry Stations off-taking biomethane from Coronation and Sedenak plant with a total volume of 47,000 MMBtu injected into our NGDS in 2023.

We are also actively exploring the upgrading of scrubbed biogas derived from Palm Oil Mill Effluent ("POME") and organic waste into biomethane. This initiative marks a significant step towards enhancing our portfolio and commitment towards sustainable practices. As we surge forward, we anticipate increased participation in achieving

net zero emissions by the mills and landfill owners to supply either the scrubbed biogas or biomethane.

In our virtual pipeline business segment, we continued to focus on the transportation of compressed biomethane sourced from biogas plants situated at palm oil mills and landfills. This transportation serves a dual purpose: firstly, to facilitate the injection of biomethane into our centralised injection station for integration into the NGDS, and secondly, to directly transport and supply biomethane to our customers' business premises. This dual-pronged approach shows our commitment to sustainability by harnessing biomethane as a renewable energy source to help mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and promote the efficient utilisation of organic waste resources.

# NURTURING AND SAFEGUARDING OUR EMPLOYEES

# EMPLOYEES

We are dedicated to fostering a sustainable and long-lasting business. Our future success is grounded in our commitment to developing and utilising our talent pool. This focus is key to ensuring the continued growth and sustainability of both our existing and new business ventures.

In 2023, Gas Malaysia emphasised enhancing employee skills through continuous learning programmes, focusing on capability and leadership development to meet the industry and new business demands. Talent development programmes and succession planning initiatives are central to our human resource strategy. We invest in comprehensive development programmes to enhance the skills and capabilities of our team, preparing them for future leadership roles. This approach fosters a culture of continuous learning. It ensures a seamless transition in leadership, vital for the company's long-term success.

Emphasising the building of human capabilities, Gas Malaysia has implemented robust Human Resources ("HR") policies designed to nurture and develop our workforce. These policies create an environment where employees can thrive, innovate and align with our business objectives.

We focus on offering competitive remuneration packages to retain our skilled workforce and continuously foster a supportive work environment. We also understand the importance of acknowledging and rewarding our team's hard work and dedication, which drives their commitment, productivity and loyalty to the company.

# HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENT ("HSE")

At Gas Malaysia, ensuring a safe and positive work environment for our employees is essential. The lessons learned over the past two (2) years have underscored the significance of our team's health and safety. The overall well-being of our staff is a cornerstone for our business' continuous growth and success.

In 2023, Gas Malaysia achieved zero Lost-Time Injuries (“LTI”) across 1,750,121 million man-hours, highlighting the company's focus on the welfare of both employees and non-employees alike. Gas Malaysia Mission ZERO was launched to reinforce this commitment, emphasising safety and environmental stewardship through robust protocols, training and stakeholder engagement.

Gas Malaysia also engaged with relevant authorities, ensuring compliance and transparency. This included strategic engagements and visits to the Department of Occupational Safety and Health ("DOSH") across various regions. Internally, Gas Malaysia conducted numerous HSE inspections, audits and comprehensive HSE training programmes to enhance awareness and preparedness for emergencies.

Furthermore, Gas Malaysia maintained its accreditation in key international management system standards, encompassing quality, environmental, occupational health and safety, and information security. Collectively, these efforts underscore the company's dedication to creating a safe, healthy and compliant working environment.

UPHOLDING GOOD GOVERNANCE AND INTEGRITY PRACTICES

Back in 2022, Gas Malaysia embarked on being ISO 37001:2016 Anti-Bribery Management Systems certified.

Following the completion of the requisite audits, I am pleased to share that we received the certification from SIRIM QAS International Sdn Bhd in July 2023. This prestigious certification was conferred upon Gas Malaysia Berhad and extends to our subsidiaries: Gas Malaysia Distribution Sdn Bhd, Gas Malaysia Energy and Services Sdn Bhd, and Gas Malaysia Retail Services Sdn Bhd. This collective achievement exemplifies our commitment to maintaining high standards of integrity and ethical conduct across our entire corporate family.

# OUTLOOK AND PROSPECTS

At Gas Malaysia, we recognise the importance of natural gas as a fuel for the energy transition. More importantly, according to the National Energy Transition Roadmap ("NETR"), natural gas is set to constitute up to  $56\%$  of the energy mix by 2050, from  $43\%$ . Against this backdrop, the long-term prospects for Gas Malaysia remain positive, and we are well-positioned to continue growing our core business to meet the needs of Malaysia's economy.

To demonstrate our commitment to supporting Malaysia's needs, we recently announced plans to expand our NGDS network to 4,000 kilometres by 2030, backed by a substantial increase in capital expenditure. Over the next five (5) years, we plan to construct 800 kilometres of pipelines, with an investment of RM1.2 to RM1.4 billion. In 2024, GMD has outlined plans to build an additional 110 kilometres of the NGDS network. This expansion will further our strategic growth and service provision, primarily focusing on several regions, including Tanjung Malim in Perak, Chembong in Negeri Sembilan, Rasa in Selangor, and Tangkak in Johor.

In addition, we will continue to adopt a customer-centric approach as competition increases under a liberalised market. Gas Malaysia aims to satisfy, attract and retain customers by offering value-added customised services and a dynamic pricing strategy, solidifying its position as the preferred energy partner.

In strengthening our market presence in CHP, we seek strategic collaborations with industrial park developers to be industries' main power solution provider. We aim to position ourselves as the energy efficient solution provider for industries. As for our biomethane business, we actively partnered with palm oil millers, landfill owners and municipal waste operators. This will allow us to explore the synergies between palm oil production residues and biomethane generation.

Additionally, the ongoing shift prompted by the energy transition, coupled with the increasing demand for clean energy and green certified products, creates numerous business opportunities for us. By adopting this forward-looking approach, we plan to play a pivotal role in the evolving energy landscape and reinforce our dedication to providing reliable and innovative energy solutions.

The initiatives above are all encapsulated within the GM32 strategy, which aims to extend the business' longevity and set us down a more sustainable path. Backed by over 30 years of experience, we will further strengthen our core and non-core business and leverage it to push into new businesses along the gas value chain.

Finally, as part of our commitment to sustainable practices in our operations, Gas Malaysia is also pioneering a pilot project to integrate electric vehicles ("EV") to integrate

them into our operational fleet. This initiative is currently under evaluation for commercial and practical feasibility. Alongside this, we are progressing with the installation of rooftop solar panels at our head office, aiming for completion at the end of 2024.

# ADVANCING ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY

Our first pillar centres on advancing environmental sustainability, placing a strong emphasis on decarbonising our operations.

# Sustainability Statement

# MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT

At Gas Malaysia, sustainability remains a core consideration of what we do and how we do it. As part of our commitment to responsible practices, we conducted a materiality assessment in 2022 to identify the critical sustainability issues that are most material to our business and stakeholders. This assessment is crucial in shaping our sustainability strategy and guiding our decision-making processes.

During the assessment, we examined various topics related to our operations, considering their potential impacts on the environment, communities, and society. The assessment process involved a thorough analysis of the significance and relevance of each topic. The outcomes of the materiality assessment were compiled into a materiality matrix, which visually represents the significance of each issue based on their impact and stakeholder relevance. This matrix is a roadmap for prioritising our sustainability efforts and allocating resources effectively. It enables us to focus on the most material issues and develop targeted strategies and action plans to address them.

We recognise that the sustainability landscape constantly evolves, and new issues may emerge over time. Therefore, we remain committed to periodically reviewing and updating our materiality assessment to ensure its relevance and effectiveness. In 2023, we conducted a revalidation exercise and found our material matters relevant and adequate.

Our material assessment process consists of three (3) steps:

# Step 1

# IDENTIFICATION

We identified a list of potential material matters that are important to both our stakeholders and Gas Malaysia, by analysing the GRI Framework.  
- We specifically analysed the Sector Standards (GRI 11: Oil and Gas Sector) of this framework to identify the list of potential material matters.  
- Based on the analysis of this framework, we identified a total of 22 potential material matters.

# Step 2

# STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

We then conducted a validation process via surveys with internal stakeholders, namely our Board and MC Members, to assess the relevancy of these matters to Gas Malaysia.  
- Through this process, a total of nine (9) material matters were selected as relevant to Gas Malaysia's operations.

# Step 3

# PRIORITISATION

We then prioritised the selected material matters based on two-criteria:

- The importance of the material matter to the stakeholder  
- The impact of the material matter on our business

We then plotted the selected material matters within our materiality matrix.

# CLIMATE ADAPTATION, RESILIENCE & TRANSITION

Climate change remains one (1) of organisations' most severe challenges, impacting operations, supply chains and overall business sustainability. To this end, we recognise the urgency for climate action, adapting to the changing environmental conditions as extreme weather disrupts production, distribution and resource availability. Gas Malaysia proactively embraces sustainable practices and implements environmentally friendly technologies to positively impact people and the planet.

The Group has embarked on a journey to reduce GHG by committing to a low-carbon future by supplying natural gas to consumers. Our efforts will empower our stakeholders to develop resilience towards environmental changes.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/307b6151-d5a6-4681-b010-4bcec09b04f5/39ef36ca2cdc2c443d31416f66bc5eaf3fbb747e2a13579412892798b892a5dd.jpg)  
HOW WE MANAGE THE MATTER

# GHG EMISSIONS

Natural gas has been recognised as the primary transitional fuel due to its status as one (1) of the cleaner forms of fossil fuels, with up to  $50\%$  less  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emission than coal.

Additionally, the Group produces electricity and heat efficiently using gas-powered CHP systems through its joint venture entities, which results in lower emissions. CHP systems consume  $32\%$  less fuel and exhibit  $50\%$  less annual carbon emissions than coal.

# BIOMETHANE

Since its first execution of the Gas Purchase Agreement in 2019, Gas Malaysia has always been committed to providing innovative and sustainable energy solutions to our customers. The agreements signed with palm oil millers and waste management operators were aimed at the offtake and purchase of biomethane generated from palm oil mill effluent ("POME") and organic waste to be injected into the Natural Gas Distribution System ("NGDS"). Biomethane helps promote climate protection by reducing harmful  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions by up to  $90\%$  when used as a fuel.

Fast forward to this year, and we have successfully secured 1,050,000 MMBtu of biomethane to be injected into the NGDS annually or directly transported and supplied a to customers via virtual pipeline.

In the first year of operation, approximately 48,000 MMBtu of biomethane was successfully injected into the NGDS. Looking ahead to 2025, we anticipate that the total biomethane to be injected into the NGDS will substantially increase to 550,000 MMBtu per annum and continuously grow with more participation from mills and waste management operators. In adherence to our dedication to advancing our technology and expertise in this renewable energy context, we actively explore upstream biomethane processes. Our strategic approach involves securing scrubbed biogas derived from POME and organic waste and upgrading it into compressed biomethane. With this approach, we aim to secure an additional 6 million MMBtu per annum of biogas by 2030.

Gas Malaysia has also completed the audit process for the ISCC Plus Certification. It is expected to receive the certificate by the end of Q1 2024. ISCC Plus Certification is a globally recognised certification standard that ensures the traceability of products across the value chain. The certification shall certify the biomethane delivered to Gas Malaysia's customers and provide assurance to them that the delivery of the certified biomethane are in compliance with global standards to meet the customers' sustainability goals.

# Sustainability Statement

# SCOPE 1 & 2 EMISSIONS

Furthermore, we also prioritise transparency and accountability in our reporting practices for GHG emissions of Scope 1 and Scope 2, adhering to international reporting frameworks. Additionally, we also ensure that we practice strict and consistent reporting of our GHG emissions to enhance our knowledge of environmental impacts and in devising more effective initiatives to reduce energy consumption and emissions.

Our Scope 1 GHG emissions encompass direct emissions from sources under the control or ownership of Gas Malaysia, while Scope 2 accounts for indirect GHG emissions linked to the acquisition of heat, steam, electricity, or cooling. We have applied the operational control approach for the calculation of our GHG emissions and our measurements align with the GHG Protocol Corporate Standards and follow the IPCC 2006 Guidelines.

The following are the emissions measured in 2023:

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/307b6151-d5a6-4681-b010-4bcec09b04f5/ef1c08deb84521f5feb988f864214d2fd522c68c81d3f96662b49020062b241d.jpg)

Scope 2 GHG Emissions  $(tCO_{2}e)$

The increase in Scope 1 emissions from 2021 to 2022 is due to incorporating emissions from our CHP plants into our GHG emissions calculations.

The decrease in Scope 1 emissions from 2022 to 2023 is due to the lower consumption of natural gas ("NG") in our CHP systems.

The increase in Scope 2 emissions from 2021 to 2022 is due to the increase in electricity usage as more staff members started working from the office resulting in more office space and facilities being utilised instead of working from home (due to COVID-19), and because our manpower increased from 2021 to 2022.

The increase in Scope 2 emissions from 2022 to 2023 is attributed to incorporating the electricity consumption from our CHP plants into our GHG emissions calculations.

# ENERGY MANAGEMENT

Efficient energy management is a crucial aspect of our business operations, not only to minimise our carbon footprint but also to instil a culture of energy conservation. This involves optimising fuel consumption, integrating energy-efficient equipment throughout our operations, and emphasising energy-saving initiatives. Our vehicles heavily depend on diesel and petrol, and our offices and stations are powered by electricity.

Additionally, we invest in succession planning as it is an integral component of talent development, where potential candidates are groomed, and employees with exceptional abilities are identified for leadership positions when required.

The training initiatives implemented during the year were strategically aligned with our overarching goal of enhancing employee skill sets while supporting our succession planning efforts. We conducted several training and leadership programmes to enhance management, fill skill gaps and improve strategic thinking capabilities.

Listed below are training programmes organised in 2023 to enhance employee skill sets and facilitate succession planning:

- General Management Programme (Senior Management)  
GMD Rapid Development Programme (Senior Management)  
- Coaching Public Speaking for C-Level (Senior Management)

# OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY & HEALTH ("OSH")

We continue to prioritise the health and safety of our employees, customers and the communities in the areas where we operate. Our commitment is evident in our pursuit of the safest working conditions, achieved through proactive risk management practices that are embedded in every aspect of our organisation, fostering operational excellence. Guided by our Health, Safety, Environment and Quality ("HSEQ") Policy, we adhere to rigorous guidelines addressing risk prevention, OSH and environmental preservation.

# HOW WE MANAGE THE MATTER

Gas Malaysia aspires to uphold the highest OSH standards, driven by an ambition to safeguard our employees and the communities in the areas where we operate. To this end, we strive to enhance our accountability to our customers and stakeholders by instilling a culture of safety risk management across the entire Group. We are governed by stringent Health, Safety and Environment ("HSE") policies and management systems that align with the requirements set by the International Organization for Standardization ("ISO").

# OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH & SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

The Group complies with internationally recognised management system standards, fostering enhanced operational efficiency and facilitating compliance with the statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to its services and industry. Concurrently, our OSH system plays a pivotal role in systematically managing risks associated with OSH, environmental conservation and the enhancement of operational service quality.

The scope of our OSH management system encompasses entities such as Gas Malaysia, Gas Malaysia Distribution Sdn Bhd ("GMD"), GMES, Gas Malaysia Retail Services Sdn Bhd ("GMRS"), and Gas Malaysia Green Ventures Sdn Bhd ("GMGV"), formerly known as Gas Malaysia Virtual Pipeline Sdn Bhd. This comprehensive approach underscores our commitment to ensuring robust standards across the entirety of our operational landscape.

Over the years, Gas Malaysia has complied the following SIRIM certifications:

# ISO 9001:2015

Quality Management Systems (since February 2000)

# ISO 14001:2015

Environmental Management Systems (since February 2003)

# ISO 45001:2018

Occupational Health & Safety Management Systems (since October 2007)

# ISO/IEC 27001:2013

(since May 2014)

In addition, the Group complies with the Occupational Safety & Health Act 1994 and ensures its HSEQ management systems are well-implemented.

# Sustainability Statement

# HAZARD IDENTIFICATION, RISK ASSESSMENT AND RISK CONTROL ("HIRARC")

Despite our efforts to integrate safety into our operations, unforeseen accidents and incidents may still occur. To effectively address and mitigate such occurrences, our HIRARC procedure serves as the cornerstone. This framework facilitates the identification of hazards, assessment of risks and the implementation of necessary control measures to enhance OSH.

To identify hazards at the workplace, we conduct consultation, training and brainstorming sessions, workplace inspections and accident investigations. These activities establish a HIRARC Register and Environmental Impact Aspect Register is established. The HIRARC also assesses OSH risks via consultation, training and brainstorming sessions. An accident investigation report will be implemented to identify root causes, analyse trends and assess the probability of an occurrence. At Gas Malaysia, the risk matrix chart evaluates risks associated with each activity, considering the likelihood of an incident and its potential severity. This will be followed by preventive and mitigative actions or control measures, which will be implemented and documented in the HIRARC Register. Ongoing monitoring will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of these measures, ultimately determining the final risk ranking as high, moderate or low.

In the event of an accident resulting in casualties such as fatality, injury, restricted work, ill health, dangerous occurrences or property damage, an investigation team comprising representatives from the relevant departments or function, the HSE Committee and an independent department or function will be formed to conduct an investigation. The team will produce a comprehensive report within 14 working days. If necessary, expert opinions will be sought. The investigation will involve gathering and analysing all relevant information to identify root causes, and the team will propose control measures to prevent recurrence. The implementation and monitoring of these actions are overseen by the Person in Charge ("PIC") of the respective department or function.

# WORK-RELATED INJURIES

Gas Malaysia is committed to preventing workplace injuries, illnesses, and fatalities by implementing comprehensive approaches and practices designed to safeguard the health and safety of employees within its operations.

In 2023, we recorded zero fatalities and three (3) employee work-related injury cases due to a contractor worker being struck by a falling filter and GMRS staff members involved in road accidents in two (2) separate incidents. Following these incidents, we immediately took appropriate measures according to procedure, increased staff training and reminded our workers of the importance of integrating safety measures into their work processes.

Looking ahead, we remain committed to identifying hazards and risks using our HIRARC procedures and aim to implement additional measures to strengthen our OSH initiatives.

# EMPLOYEES' TRAINING ON OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY & HEALTH

In addition to adhering to policies, regulations and procedures, the Group emphasises the importance of teaching a robust safety culture among employees. This entails creating awareness and constantly reminding workers of the rules and measures necessary to enhance the effectiveness of our HSEQ initiatives.

In 2023, we provided health and safety training to enhance employees' OSH knowledge. A total of 54 employees participated in the health and safety training.

# WORKER PARTICIPATION, CONSULTATION AND COMMUNICATION ON OSH

We have a Steering HSE Committee in place, which serves as a platform for employees to discuss safety, health and welfare issues. Apart from addressing OSH issues, the committee is tasked with formulating policies, procedures, rules and regulations. The Steering HSE Committee also has authority on decision-making in any OSH-related matters. Additionally, Gas Malaysia has established safety and health committees in its branch offices, including one (1) with 40 or more employees, in compliance with regulatory requirements.

The quorum for the Steering HSE Committee comprises a chairman ("GCEO"), a secretary (Head of Health, Safety, Environment, Quality & Performance Enhancement) and the Head of Department/Head of Section as the management representative. Executives and non-executives from various departments, functions and subsidiaries are appointed to represent workers. Gas Malaysia has also formed HSE sub-committees, namely the Facilities HSE sub-committee and Technical HSE sub-committee, to support and assist in disseminating information and action plans. These sub-committees function as a bridge for OSH-related issues requiring management decisions. The Steering HSE Committee and HSE sub-committee convene every three (3) months. The Committee is also responsible for conducting quarterly workplace inspections and accident investigations.

# Sustainability Statement

In 2023, we invested over RM614,668.40 in these initiatives to support communities:

# Back to School Programme

As part of our annual initiative, we organised a 'Back to School' programme, supporting 327 underprivileged students at Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Bandar Sungai Buaya in Rawang. These students received essential school supplies. We also contributed 10 used computers to enhance computer literacy, recognising its importance in today's digital world. Aligned with our "Education" pillar of CSR, this programme aimed to alleviate the families' burden by providing school necessities like uniforms, shoes and hijabs for the 2023 academic year. A total of RM49,050 was invested in this initiative.

# Partnership with Yayasan Pelajaran MARA ("YPM")

As education is vital to our nation's development, Gas Malaysia has established a collaborative partnership with YPM to provide support for the education of underprivileged B40 students. We contributed RM407,000 to this initiative, benefiting 1,100 B40 students.

# Food Distribution for the Urban Poor and Homeless Communities

Committed to making a meaningful impact on the lives of the underserved and underprivileged, Gas Malaysia initiated a CSR programme in partnership with Pertubuhan Tindakan Wanita Islam ("PERTIWI"). This collaboration aims to provide meals to the homeless and urban poor at the Kuala Lumpur Homeless Transit Centre, coinciding with the  $60^{\text{th}}$  Malaysia Day celebration. The community outreach initiative comprises three (3) sessions to maximise its impact and support more beneficiaries. This marks Gas Malaysia's first collaboration with PERTIWI, reflecting a significant effort to address urban poverty in the city and extend support to the homeless community. A total of RM6,905.95 was invested in the food distribution effort, benefiting 720 individuals from homeless and urban poor communities.

# Palestine Humanitarian Aid Fund

The ongoing conflict in Palestine has resulted in a substantial loss of lives, leaving Palestinians in need of essential supplies like medicine, food and basic necessities. Recognising the urgent need for support, Gas Malaysia has adopted a philanthropic stance, by taking a charitable approach to aid the Palestinian people. Gas Malaysia contributed to two (2) NGOs to provide support to Palestinians: RM25,000 to Global Peace Mission and RM100,000 to Mercy Malaysia.

# Tree Planting and River Cleaning Programme with Local and Orang Asli Communities in Behrang

We organised a CSR programme in collaboration with the local community at Kampung Pos Bersih, Behrang, Perak. Activities included planting fruit saplings, cleaning the river and distributing Bakul Rezeki to approximately 40 underprivileged families, with a focus on the Orang Asli community. Gas Malaysia contributed RM14,212.45 to this initiative.

Our goal is to create a safe, trustworthy and reliable distribution of gas to our industrial, commercial and residential customers in Malaysia.

By doing so, we contribute to the overall integrity and sustainability of the country's gas distribution industry. To achieve this, we set strong principles prioritising safety, reliability, and ethical standards in our operations. This means we consistently uphold these values in every aspect of our work. We are dedicated to adhering to robust corporate governance principles and abiding by applicable laws and regulations in our highly regulated sector.

# HOW WE MANAGE THE MATTER

We actively take measures to prevent corruption, recognising its significant financial, operational, and reputational risks that can hinder our business growth. To maintain a robust ethical framework in Gas Malaysia, we are guided by the following key policies and guidelines:

Gas Malaysia Group of Companies Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy  
Whistleblower Policy  
- Gifts Guidelines

We also comply with other relevant laws to promote organisational transparency and accountability. Furthermore, our strategic approach includes implementing the T.R.U.S.T. principles and the Anti-Bribery Management System, which aligns with the Malaysian Standards ISO 37001:2016. During the year under review, we received the ISO 37001:2016 Anti-Bribery Management System (“ABMS”) Certification by SIRIM QAS.

# Sustainability Statement

# ANTI-BRIBERY AND ANTI-CORRUPTION

Sustaining a strong culture of integrity throughout our business operations remains a fundamental pillar in nurturing effective corporate governance at Gas Malaysia. To address this, the Integrity and Governance Department is responsible for enhancing the overall integrity and governance of the organisation. Our dedication to integrity remains steadfast and is reinforced by a robust ABAC Policy, designed to eradicate all forms of corruption.

We offer training programmes designed to enhance our employees' understanding of contemporary issues surrounding bribery and corruption, aiming to raise awareness among them. As such, our people have attended training programmes on the following topics:

# Non-Management

- Do The Right Thing  
- ABAC Policy & Gifts Guideline Awareness

We also formulated our Gifts Guideline which clarifies our stance, categorises types of gifts, and sets forth the process for declaring gifts. Approval in accordance with the Gas Malaysia's Limits of Authority ("LOA") is required for accepting and offering gifts among employees, customers, vendors, contractors and third parties. It is crucial that the management of all gifts prevents misuse, including for the personal interests of the employee.

During the year under review, there were zero instances of ABAC Policy violations reported.

# OPERATIONS ASSESSED FOR CORRUPTION-RELATED RISKS

In our ongoing commitment to combat corruption and drive progress and sustainable change within our organisation, we consistently subject our operations to thorough assessments for any corruption-related risks. We continue to perform a series of CRA sessions across all Gas Malaysia business units. The aim of this assessment is to enhance the current corruption risk register and ensure a proactive approach to addressing potential risks. As of 31 December 2023,  $85\%$  of Gas Malaysia's operations have undergone assessment and finalisation for corruption-related risks. GMEA, GMSD, and GMGV have yet to finalise their assessments of corruption risks.

# Sustainability Statement

# COMMUNICATION AND TRAINING ON ANTI-CORRUPTION

It is imperative to comprehensively educate our people on the significance of adhering to best practices to combat bribery and corruption. Engaging in such behaviours goes against our corporate principles and is also illegal, putting individuals and our organisation at risk of facing fines and penalties that could lead to significant financial and reputational harm.

We conducted comprehensive briefings and awareness sessions on Anti-Corruption Policies and Procedures for all Gas Malaysia staff members, including our esteemed Board of Directors.

# Percentage of Board of Directors informed of Anti-Corruption Policies and Procedures

The revised ABAC Policy and Framework for Gas Malaysia has been approved for adoption by the Directors at its Board of Directors' meeting held on 12 May 2022.

# Percentage of Employees informed of Anti-Corruption Policies and Procedures

All employees across all categories are informed about Gas Malaysia's Anti-Corruption Policies and Procedures through various channels including email communications, e-bulletins, the Integrity Portal on SharePoint, Integrity Corner on the notice board, bunting, display stands and during induction sessions.

# CUSTOMER PRIVACY

During 2023, we received zero complaints regarding breaches of customer privacy or losses of customer data.

# ANTI-COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOUR

Gas Malaysia is committed to fostering healthy competition among businesses, acknowledging its role in stimulating innovation and operational efficiency. This commitment leads to competitive pricing, superior product and service quality, increased consumer choices and enhanced overall value.

We are steadfast in complying with both local and international laws on anti-competitive conduct and monopolistic practices. Our aim is to prevent any actions that could reduce competition, impact our production capacity and establish monopolies in the realms of distribution, transportation and supply to our customers.

# HOW WE MANAGE THE MATTER

The regulatory framework for TPA has been established to effectively oversee and address anti-competitive practices. This framework empowers third-party entities by granting them access to gas facilities that are not under their ownership or operation. Through the TPA system, multiple entities can access and utilise gas facilities within Malaysia.

Moreover, we have successfully separated our business operations into two (2) distinct entities in anticipation of full market liberalisation: GMD and GMES. Both entities, wholly owned by Gas Malaysia, have obtained distribution and shipping licences.

GMD has been awarded a 20-year distribution licence, empowering it to serve as a gas distributor through its NGDS across Peninsular Malaysia. On the other hand, GMES, with a 10-year shipping licence, operates as a gas shipper procuring gas from a shipper and delivering it according to customers' specifications. This strategic unbundling strengthens our value and standing in the gas industry.

In order to ensure orderly and effective discharge of its responsibilities, the Board has in place a Governance Structure for the Group where specific powers of the Board are delegated to the relevant Board Committees and the Group Chief Executive Officer ("GCEO"), as illustrated:

# Corporate Governance Overview Statement

PRINCIPLE A

# BOARD ACTIVITIES FOR FYE 2023

The Board maintains an agenda that addresses strategic planning, budget approval, corporate governance matters, financial performance review, sustainability initiatives and evaluation of business opportunities. The Board actively contributes insights to the Management regarding the Group's overall strategy. The discussions focus on building strengths as total energy solutions provider, enhancing financial resilience, and delivering consistent and robust returns to shareholders.

# THE BOARD AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT IN SUSTAINABILITY

The Board has an overall responsibility for the Group sustainability and, the Board's Risk & Compliance Committee ("RCC") has the oversight on steering and evaluating the sustainability efforts and the Sustainability Reporting. The RCC is supported by a Management Committee ("MC") comprising senior management which reports to the GCEO. The GCEO and MC are responsible for providing guidance to developing and implementing Gas Malaysia's sustainability goals and strategies. The MC also reviews and recommends appropriate sustainability strategies and goals to the RCC. The Board ensures that the Company's sustainability strategies, priorities and targets as well as performance against these targets are communicated to its internal and external stakeholders.

To effectively implement its 10-year strategic business plan, known as "GM32" and demonstrate the Company's commitment to supporting the national energy transition agenda, Gas Malaysia has crafted a comprehensive Sustainability Framework that serves as a key facilitator for sustainable growth and the optimisation of strategic advantages, which aligns with the National Energy Transition Roadmap and New Industrial Master Plan 2030.

# II. BOARD COMPOSITION

# COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD

The Board comprises four (4) Independent Non-Executive Directors ("INEDs") and four (4) Non-Independent Non-Executive Directors ("NINEDs"), composed of members who bring experience from various disciplines primarily, accounting, finance, legal/regulatory, economics, commercial, engineering/technical, and gas and utilities.

With the retirement of the two (2) INEDs, Datuk Puteh Rukiah binti Abd. Majid and Encik Tan Lye Chong, there was a new appointment of Puan Chow Mei Mei as an INED on 21 August 2023.

In accordance with the MMLR, none of the members of the Board hold more than five (5) directorships in listed companies.

The profile of each of the member of the Board is as presented on pages 79 to 87 of this Annual Report.

# INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS

The Board has implemented the subsequent measures to reinforce its autonomy in accordance with the Enhanced Director Amendments of MMLR:

(i) The Board Charter has a policy limiting the tenure of INEDs to 12 years. In April 2023, Datuk Syed Abu Bakar bin S Mohsin Almohdzar had been re-designated as a NINED in view that his tenure as an INED of the Company was approaching 12 years.  
(ii) Due to the same reason above, at the  $32^{\text{nd}}$  Annual General Meeting ("AGM") held on 22 May 2023, Datuk Puteh Rukiah binti Abd. Majid and Encik Tan Lye Chong had voluntarily retired from the Board.

Following due consideration, the Board has determined that all INEDs have fulfilled the criteria under the definition of an independent director as stated in the MMLR of Bursa Securities and are able to maintain their independence and objective judgements, and contribute positively to the business strategies, operations and corporate governance of the Company and the Group.

# Corporate Governance Overview Statement

The main responsibility of risk coordinators would be to identify risks and subsequently map them to the risk register. Next, the compiled risks will be communicated to the respective HOCs and HODs. Risks that are categorised as major will be forwarded to the RCMC for its deliberation.

# Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control

# 4) GAS MALAYSIA RISK REGISTER ("GRR")

All risks previously identified will be recorded in the GRR. The compilation will then be reviewed by the RCMC.

After the completion of the reviewing process, the RCC will be informed about the most significant risks identified. The rating or score is determined based on the consequences, root cause and the current capability of controls the Group has to mitigate the resultant impact.

# 5) BUSINESS CONTINUITY MANAGEMENT MANUAL ("BCMM")

BCMM was created with the objective of achieving the Group's goal which is to minimise the effect of any incident on employees, business partners, local community and environment. It is of utmost importance that business functions will continue to function even in the event of a crisis.

BCMM covers two (2) major elements, which are Emergency Management ("EM") and Business Continuity Management ("BCM"). EM is a programme created to control the overall culmination of a physical incident within a business unit. The programme integrates both operations response to an emergency as well as supporting staff functions such as law, insurance, public affairs and human resources.

On the other hand, BCM's main function is to protect corporate assets from an actual or potential threat caused by either a catastrophic incident, a non-physical event or series of negative developments which escalate to crisis proportions. BCMM underlines the strategies and actions to be taken during the incident. It relies on an equalised evaluation of probable impact on the Group's operations, image and liability. Through systematic management in place, BCMM strives to handle those impacts so that the business recovery can be accelerated.

In order to ensure that sufficient resources are readily accessible, the plan undergoes constant reassessment, testing and auditing process. These continuous updates and improvements are significant to ensure that it remains relevant and allows the Group to effectively and efficiently face the challenges posed by any incidents.

As a means to facilitate the above, the Group has prepared the following:

# A Emergency Response Plan ("ERP")

The creation of ERP is an embodiment of the Group's commitment towards responding effectively to all emergencies that affect the Group. The plan strives to assure that immediate and effective response can be taken during emergency situations. This is achieved by providing training as well as maintaining adequate resources in dealing with crisis. The main goal of ERP is to minimise the after-effect of an emergency by minimising the risk to the public and employees and at the same time, protecting property and limiting damages to the environment.

Generally, the ERP revolves around on-site procedures which are to be performed by related personnel when an emergency occurs. The main priority of this measure would be the safety of the people, the protection of the public as well as the conservation of the environment wherein the damage must be kept as minimal as possible. However, it is important to note that due to the volatile and irregular nature of emergencies, most procedures are presented as general guidelines rather than inflexible rules.

# B Computer Disaster Recovery Centre ("CDRC")

CDRC is a coordinated process of restoring crucial systems, data and infrastructures that are required to sustain the key on-going business operations during a crisis. The Group has set up its own CDRC, where core and main servers for the Group's IT operations are replicated outside the main operation buildings. The centre will also host the backup Operation Control Room ("OCR") in which, it has a similar function as the main OCR located at the Head Office. All these will make it possible for the critical data to remain safely intact and uncorrupted when disaster occurs.

# C Health, Safety, Environment and Quality ("HSEQ") Policy

The HSEQ Policy outlines the strong commitment of the Group towards its employees, business partners and the general public. Each and every practical and possible step identified will be considered and monitored by the HSEQ committee. As a result, risks of occupational injury and health illness amongst personnel and damages to the environment can be managed and minimised. At the same time, the quality of services will be enhanced as well.

# Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control

# B) KEY ELEMENTS OF INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM ("ICS")

Outlined below are the other essential components of the Group's internal control system:

# 1) GOVERNANCE AND CONTROL ENVIRONMENT

- Delegation of responsibilities between the Board and the Management are clearly defined. This is done via proper documentation of authorisation procedures as well as line of accountability for authorisation, approval and control procedures. In line with that, a Limits of Authority framework is prepared to establish the availability of limits to govern the functions within the scope. Significant transactions such as major tenders, acquisitions and disposals must be approved by the Board.  
- The Standard Operating Procedures ("SOPs") are regularly updated parallel with the latest developments in the Group to ensure that they will remain relevant at all times. The SOPs would document the internal control procedures including how specific objectives can be achieved based on respective processes.  
- ISO 9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015, ISO 45001:2018, ISO/IEC 27001:2013 & ISO 37001:2016 are certifications obtained for the Group's operational processes.

# 2) RISK ASSESSMENT

Regular meetings will be held amongst the HOCs and HODs to discuss any recent major risk issues affecting the Group and control procedures to mitigate those risks. These meetings allow quality decisions to be made and at the same time, promoting teamwork in problem-solving.

# 3) ANTI-BRIBERY AND ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICY AND FRAMEWORK

The Group is committed to conduct its business professionally, ethically and with the highest standards of integrity. Taking into cognizance Section 17A of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (Amendment) Act 2018 that came into force in June 2020, the Group therefore adopted and implemented an Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy and Framework on 16 February 2020. The Policy was later reviewed, revised and approved by the Board of Directors on 16 February 2023. Minor amendments were made related to the change of Whistleblowing e-mail address domain, Policy Statement, Disclosures of Improper Conduct, Investigation Report and Revocation of Whistleblower Protection.

# 4) CONTROL ACTIVITIES

Control activities are performed at all levels within the Group through policies and procedures to ensure that Management's directives to mitigate risks in achieving business objectives are carried out. Relevant control activities within the Group include operational controls, financial reporting controls, internal and external audits and whistleblowing policy.

# 5) INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION

The implementation of an Enterprise Resource Planning system facilitates a smooth flow of information among critical business functions within the Group. In return, it increases the quality of control and efficiency of operations.

# 6) MONITORING

- The Internal Audit Department has been assigned the responsibility to conduct reviews on the governance, risk management and internal controls of the Group. Subsequently, recommendations will be proposed to the Management should there be any room for improvement. The findings and recommendations will then be reported to the Audit Committee. The Committee shall act as the representative of the Board to put all the notions into consideration regarding the efficiency and sufficiency of the Group's internal controls.  
- Every month, the monthly performance will be analysed against the budget and the comparative preceding year's performance by Accounting and Finance Department. The findings will be tabled to the Management during the monthly Management Committee meeting. This is done prior to the data being reported to the Audit Committee and the Board on a quarterly basis. This allows constant and timely performance monitoring. As such, any issues which impede the budget achievement goal is addressed early in an effective manner.  
- The Group has engaged external auditors to perform limited assurance review on the Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control ("SORMIC") document in accordance with Audit and Assurance Practice Guide ("AAPG") 3 issued by the Malaysian Institute of Accountants and report their findings to the Group's Board of Directors.

# Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control

- The external auditors will highlight significant deficiencies in internal control noted during the course of their audit of the statutory financial statements of Gas Malaysia Berhad and its subsidiaries. They will also provide recommendations to mitigate those weaknesses in internal controls and to seek the management action plans, and thereafter, report to the Audit Committee.

The Board and Management acknowledge the importance of constant monitoring of the Group. This is due to the ever-changing nature of the risks faced by the Group. Hence, to ensure the process is up to date, improvement and enhancement of the internal control must be conducted on an on-going basis to ensure that all probable impact of the identified risks can be mitigated timely.

# RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM EFFECTIVENESS

The regular assessment by the Board to ensure an effective risk management and internal control systems of the Group is conducted through the following mechanisms:

- To begin with, the Board utilises numerous data and tools to measure whether the current risk management and internal control systems are still effective and relevant with the current condition. The data and tools include comparison between actual and planned performance, key financial as well as operational performance.  
- Subsequently, the Management shall keep the Board updated on the Group's performance in relation to the plans and developments of both internal and external aspects. These discussions will be held on a quarterly basis. In addition, specific transactions, projects or opportunities will be discussed with the Board when the need arises. This allows the Board to determine if there are any new risks which need to be addressed as well as highlight elements of action plans and internal controls which must be enhanced for better results.  
- Afterwards, all the improvements required will be addressed appropriately. These actions were carried out based on the results of reviews by the internal auditors. The outcome of the reviews will be discussed with the Audit Committee while the follow-up monitoring tasks will be carried out by the Management and internal auditors.

- Ultimately, the overall risk management activities and risk registers will be presented to the Board at least twice (2) a year. This is done to provide a complete overview of the Group's key risks and how they are being managed.

# COMMENTARY ON THE ADEQUACY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROLS SYSTEMS

The Board agrees that the risk management and system of internal control practices as described above are effective and cover up to the date of the approval of this statement for inclusion in the annual report. For the financial year under review, the Board is satisfied that the system of internal controls and risk management processes are adequate and sound in providing reasonable assurance in safeguarding shareholders' investments, the Group's assets and other stakeholders' interests as well as in addressing key risks impacting the business operations of the Group. There was no major internal control weakness identified that may result in any material loss or uncertainty that would require disclosure in this annual report.

# CONCLUSION

# RECRUITMENT AND ANNUAL ASSESSMENT OF DIRECTORS

One of the key functions of the NRC is to manage the nomination and selection of candidates to the Board. For the assessment and selection of Directors, the NRC is guided by the Fit and Proper Policy of the Group and shall consider the following factors of the prospective Directors:

- Character, experience, skills, knowledge, expertise and competence;  
Professionalism;  
- Commitment (including time commitment), contribution and performance;  
- Integrity;  
- In the case of candidates for the position of Independent Non-Executive Directors, the NRC will evaluate the candidates' ability to discharge such responsibilities/functions as expected from Independent Non-Executive Directors; and  
Boardroom diversity.

During the year under review, the NRC had deliberated on the need to refresh the Board's composition. Upon the retirement of Datuk Puteh Rukiah binti Abd. Majid at the  $32^{\mathrm{nd}}$  Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 22 May 2023, and in complying with Paragraph 15.02(1)(b) of the MMLR of Bursa Securities which requires a listed issuer to have at least one (1) woman director, the NRC had reviewed and assessed Puan Chow Mei Mei's character, integrity, expertise, time and commitment and is satisfied that she has fulfilled the required criteria set by the Company's Fit & Proper Policy. With the recommendation of the NRC and having reviewed her vast knowledge and experience in the oil & gas and energy & utilities company, the Board approved her appointment as an ID of the Company with effect from 21 August 2023.

The NRC undertakes an annual assessment on the effectiveness of the Board as a whole, its Committees, the contribution of each individual Director, including IDs, as well as the required mix of skills, experience and other qualities of the Board members, including core competencies which IDs should bring to the Board.

For the year under review, the Company had engaged Boardroom Corporate Services Sdn Bhd ("Boardroom") an independent expert to facilitate the conduct of the Board Effectiveness Evaluation ("BEE"). The BEE was conducted through questionnaires circulated to the Board which comprised the assessment of the Board, Board Committees and Individual Directors, including IDs, and one-to-one online interview session with all eight (8) directors.

The effectiveness of the Board is assessed in the following areas:

- Board mix and composition;  
- Board effectiveness/Board function;  
- Access to information;  
- Board operation and issues on Board agenda;  
- Board Chairman's role;  
- Relationship with Management;  
- Relationship with shareholders/stakeholders; and  
- Environmental, Social and Governance.

The effectiveness of the Board Committees is assessed in terms of among others:

- Composition and governance;  
- Quality, skills and competencies;  
- Meeting administration and conduct; and  
Information technology.

The assessment of Individual Directors' contribution and performance is conducted based on the following areas:

- Leadership and strategy;  
- Legal and regulatory requirements;  
- Corporate governance, risk management and internal controls;  
- Accounting and financial reporting;  
- Industry experience;  
- Operations and quality management; and  
Information technology.

# Nomination & Remuneration Committee Report

# RECRUITMENT AND ANNUAL ASSESSMENT OF DIRECTORS (CONTINUED)

In March 2024, Boardroom presented to the NRC and thereafter to the Board the outcome of the BEE. The overall average score for the areas of assessment was  $93\%$ . The results of these assessments form the basis of the NRC's recommendations to the Board for the re-election of Directors at the forthcoming AGM of the Company. The details of the BEE are described in the Corporate Governance Report.

In conclusion, based on the BEE conducted for the financial year under review, the Board is satisfied of its existing number and composition and is of the view that, with the current mix of skills, knowledge, experience and strength, the Board as a whole is able to discharge its duties effectively.

# COMMISSIONER FOR OATHS

# Independent Auditors' Report

TO THE MEMBERS OF GAS MALAYSIA BERHAD

(Incorporated in Malaysia)

Registration No. 199201008906 (240409-T)

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# Our opinion

In our opinion, the financial statements of Gas Malaysia Berhad ("the Company") and its subsidiaries ("the Group") give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and of the Company as at 31 December 2023, and of their financial performance and their cash flows for the financial year then ended in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.

# What we have audited

We have audited the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, which comprise the statements of financial position as at 31 December 2023 of the Group and of the Company, and the statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows of the Group and of the Company for the financial year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, comprising a summary of material accounting policies, as set out on pages 137 to 198.

# Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the "Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements" section of our report.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

# Independence and other ethical responsibilities

We are independent of the Group and of the Company in accordance with the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, Conduct and Practice) of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants ("By-Laws") and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) ("IESBA Code"), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the By-Laws and the IESBA Code.

# Our audit approach

As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company. In particular, we considered where the Directors made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters, consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.

We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and of the Company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group and the Company operate.

# Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

<table><tr><td>Key audit matter</td><td>How our audit addressed the key audit matter</td></tr><tr><td>Accrual for gas costs</td><td>We performed the following:</td></tr><tr><td>The Group recognised gas cost accrual of RM486.3 million as at 31 December 2023 as disclosed in Note 23 to the financial statements. As there is a timing difference between the supply of gas and the receipt of the actual billing from the gas supplier as at the end of the reporting period, the unbilled gas cost is accrued based on the gas volume supplied by its gas supplier to its gas network. Refer to 3(h)(ii), Note 5 and Note 23 to the financial statements.</td><td>We tested the design and operating effectiveness of management&#x27;s key controls on the comparison between the total customers&#x27; meter readings against the total natural gas supplied to determine the volume of gas supplied but had not been billed by the supplier as at the end of the reporting period.For billings that have been issued by the supplier and received by management subsequent to the reporting date, we traced these billings to the accruals recorded at the reporting date.For billings that have not been issued by the supplier subsequent to the reporting date, we tested the management&#x27;s computation of the gas volume consumed against the gas volume sold to the customers.We tested management&#x27;s steps to address the variances in gas volume above the threshold set by management, which is based on historical data for the gas losses in-transit between the supply pipeline and the pipeline connection at the customers&#x27; premises.We reviewed the gas supply agreements signed between the Group and the supplier, and reviewed the legal opinion by an external solicitor obtained in prior year to ascertain the Group&#x27;s obligation in accruing the gas cost.Based on the procedures performed, there were no material exceptions.</td></tr></table>

We have determined that there are no key audit matters to report for the Company.

Registration No. 199201008906 (240409-T)

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

# Information other than the financial statements and auditors' report thereon

The Directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Directors' Report, Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control and Audit Committee Report, which we obtained prior to the date of this auditors' report, and Management Discussion and Analysis, Sustainability Report and Chairman's Statement and the other sections of the 2023 annual report, which is expected to be made available to us after that date. Other information does not include the financial statements of the Group and of the Company and our auditors' report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditors' report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements

The Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company that give a true and fair view in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

# Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

# Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements (continued)

As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

(a) Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.  
(b) Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's and of the Company's internal control.  
(c) Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors.  
(d) Conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's or on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.  
(e) Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.  
(f) Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements of the Group. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

# Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements (continued)

From the matters communicated with the Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# OTHER MATTERS

This report is made solely to the members of the Company, as a body, in accordance with Section 266 of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility to any other person for the content of this report.

# 2 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES

The Group's and the Company's activities are exposed to a variety of financial risks, including profit rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group's and the Company's overall financial risk management objective is to ensure that the Group and the Company create value for the shareholders. Financial risk management is carried out through risk reviews, internal control systems, an insurance programme and adherence to Group's financial risk management policies.

# (a) Profit rate risk

The Group's and the Company's income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market profit rates. The profit rate exposure arises from the Group's and the Company's deposits and borrowings, and are not material to the operations of the Group and of the Company.

# Notes to the Financial Statements

for the financial year ended 31 December 2023 (continued)

# 2 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# (b) Credit risk

# Risk management

The Group's and the Company's exposure to credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivable balances. The Company's exposure to credit risk arises from amounts due from subsidiaries and joint ventures. Risks arising therefrom are minimised through:

Performing regular reviews of the aging profiles of amounts due from subsidiaries and joint ventures.  
- Investing cash assets safely and profitably, which involves placement of cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits with established banks or financial institutions. In addition, the Group and the Company set exposure limits as well as limiting placement tenures to less than one (1) year for each of the financial institutions.  
Performing credit evaluations on customers and assessing the credit quality of the customers by taking into account their financial positions, past experience and other factors.  
Ensuring the collection risk arising from trade receivables is minimised by imposing a requirement for a 2-month or 3-month financial guarantee on its customers. A credit review committee meets regularly and closely monitors the trade receivables.

# Measurement of Expected Credit Loss ("ECL")

The Group and the Company set out three (3) categories of receivables that reflect their credit risks and loss allowance is determined for these categories.

# (i) Trade receivables using simplified approach

The Group and the Company classify their trade receivables by nature of the customer accounts i.e. active accounts and terminated accounts. In determining the expected loss rates, the Group and the Company take into consideration the following:

- The collection of a 2-month or 3-month financial guarantee (e.g. collection in the form of cash deposits, issuance of bank guarantees by the customers in the name of the Group, etc.) from the customers prior to the commencement of supply of gas. These financial guarantees are reviewed periodically to ensure that the amounts remain appropriate vis-à-vis the value of the gas supplied or reserved firm capacity.  
- Issuance of suspension notice to the customers with payments past due 1 day from the credit terms for gas sales. Thereafter, customers are given a grace period of 7 days from the issuance of the suspension notice, and failure to make payments will entail the disconnection of gas supply to the customer's premise.  
- Issuance of suspension notice to the customers with payments past due 14 days from the credit terms for provision of tolling services. Thereafter, customers are given a grace period of 14 days from the issuance of the suspension notice, and failure to make payments will entail the disconnection of tolling services.

These, together with very low default rate, resulted in immaterial credit losses. No significant changes to estimation techniques or assumptions were made during the reporting period.

The Group's and the Company's maximum exposure to credit risk and loss allowance recognised as at the reporting date are disclosed in Note 17. The remaining amount for which no ECL allowance was recognised is deemed to be recoverable, with low probability of default.

# 2 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# (b) Credit risk (continued)

Measurement of Expected Credit Loss ("ECL") (continued)

(i) Trade receivables using simplified approach (continued)

Concentration of credit risk arises when a number of customers are engaged in similar business activities or activities within the same geographic region, or when they have similar risk characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. The Group continuously monitors its portfolios to identify and assess significant concentration of credit risk.

The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk in the current financial year arising from exposure to a single counterparty or a group of counterparties having similar risk characteristics. This is due to the Group's large number of customers and their wide geographical spread. The Group manages credit risk arising from trade and other receivables through credit quality evaluation, ongoing debt collection, regular monitoring of debtors' account and credit limits and accepting only appropriate bank guarantees (if applicable) issued by renowned financial institutions as well as collecting adequate cash deposits.

(ii) Debt instruments at amortised cost other than trade receivables, using the 3-stage general approach

The Group and the Company use four (4) categories to reflect their credit risk and how the loss allowance is determined for each of the categories. A summary of the assumptions underpinning the Group's and the Company's expected credit loss is as follows:

<table><tr><td>Category</td><td>Definition of category</td><td>Basis of recognition of ECL provision</td></tr><tr><td>Performing</td><td>Debtors have a low risk of default and a strong capacity to meet the contractual cash flows.</td><td>12 months expected losses. Where the expected lifetime on an asset is less than 12 months, expected losses are measured at its expected lifetime.</td></tr><tr><td>Underperforming</td><td>Debtors for which there is a significant increase in credit risk due to actual or expected significant adverse changes in business, financial or economic conditions that are expected to cause a significant change to the debtor&#x27;s ability to meet its obligation.</td><td>Lifetime expected losses.</td></tr><tr><td>Non-performing</td><td>There is evidence indicating the assets is credit-impaired.</td><td>Lifetime expected losses.</td></tr><tr><td>Write-off</td><td>There is evidence indicating that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery based on unavailability of debtor&#x27;s sources of income or assets to generate sufficient future cash flows to repay the amount.</td><td>Asset is written-off.</td></tr></table>

Based on the above, loss allowance is measured on either 12-month ECL or lifetime ECL using a PD ("Probability of Default") x LGD ("Loss Given Default") x EAD ("Exposure at Default") methodology.

# (b) Credit risk (continued)

Measurement of Expected Credit Loss ("ECL") (continued)

(ii) Debt instruments at amortised cost other than trade receivables, using the 3-stage general approach (continued)

In deriving the PD and the LGD, the historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors (such as crude oil prices and gross domestic product growth) affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables. The historical loss rates will be adjusted based on expected changes in these factors. No significant changes to estimation techniques or assumptions were made during the reporting period.

For intercompany balances that are repayable on demand, the Company's ECL is based on the following assumptions:

- If the borrower has sufficient accessible highly liquid assets in order to repay the loan if demanded at the reporting date, the ECL is likely to be immaterial.  
- If the borrower could not repay the loan if demanded at the reporting date, the Company considers the expected manner of recovery to measure the ECL. The recovery manner could be either through 'repayment over time' or a fire sale of less liquid assets by the borrower.  
- If the recovery strategies indicate that the Company would fully recover the outstanding balance of the loan, the ECL would be limited to the effect of the discounting of the amount due on the loan, at the loan's effective interest rates, over the period until the amount is fully recovered.

All of the Group's and of the Company's debt instruments at amortised cost other than trade receivables are considered to have low credit risks, as these were considered to be performing, have low risks of default and historically there were minimal instances where contractual cash flow obligations have not been met.

The maximum exposure to credit risks for debt instruments at amortised cost other than trade receivables are represented by the carrying amounts recognised in the statements of financial position.

# (iii) Financial guarantee contracts

The Company has issued the Kafalah guarantee to a bank for Sukuk Murabahah Programme ("SMP") granted to its subsidiary, as disclosed in Note 24.

The Company is exposed to credit risk arising from the financial guarantee contract given to the bank for its subsidiary's borrowings where the maximum credit risk exposure is the amount of the borrowings utilised by the subsidiary. The Company believes that the financial guarantee contract is considered to be performing, has low risk of default and is unlikely to be called upon by the subsidiary's bank. Accordingly, no loss allowance was identified based on 12 months ECL.

Sukuk Murakah Programmes</td><td>330,191</td><td>241,233</td></tr></table>

Information regarding trade and other receivables that are neither past due nor impaired is disclosed in Note 17.

Credit risk from cash and cash equivalents is managed on a group basis. Only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of "A" as assessed by reference to RAM Rating Services Berhad are accepted.

Deposits with banks are neither past due nor impaired and have no history of default.

# (c) Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and ensuring the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities.

Whilst the Group's and the Company's current liabilities exceeded their current assets by RM156,083,000 (2022: RM139,835,000) and RM176,638,000 (2022: RM197,395,000) respectively, the Directors are of the view that the Group and the Company are able to meet their obligations based on the cash flow forecast of the Group and of the Company for the next twelve months from the reporting date. In addition, the Group and the Company have undrawn committed borrowing facilities of RM870,000,000 (2022: RM959,000,000) as at 31 December 2023.

At the Company level, the future dividend distribution from its subsidiaries are expected to alleviate the liquidity position of the Company.

# (d) Capital management

The Group's and the Company's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern while seeking to maximise benefits to shareholders and other stakeholders.

The Group and the Company actively and regularly review and manage their capital structure to ensure optimal capital structure and shareholder returns, taking into consideration the future capital requirements of the Group and the Company, prevailing and projected profitability, projected operating cash flows, projected capital expenditure and projected strategic investment opportunities. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders. The Company targets a dividend ratio of not less than  $75\%$  of profit after tax.

The Group monitors capital utilisation based on the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total capital. Total debt is calculated as total borrowings (comprising short term and long term borrowings as well as lease liabilities as shown in the statements of financial position). Total capital is calculated as the sum of total equity and total debt.

The gearing ratios as at the reporting date are as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan="3"></td><td colspan="2">Group</td></tr><tr><td>2023</td><td>2022</td></tr><tr><td>RM&#x27;000</td><td>RM&#x27;000</td></tr><tr><td>Total debt</td><td>333,643</td><td>244,491</td></tr><tr><td>Total equity</td><td>1,367,875</td><td>1,278,335</td></tr><tr><td>Total capital</td><td>1,701,518</td><td>1,522,826</td></tr><tr><td>Gearing ratio</td><td>19.6%</td><td>16.1%</td></tr></table>

There were no changes in the Group's approach to capital management during the current financial year. The Group maintains a debt to equity ratio that complied with the debt covenants in respect of the borrowings undertaken by the Group.

# (e) Fair value hierarchy

The assets and liabilities carried at fair value are categorized into different levels of fair value hierarchy as follows:

Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived prices).  
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs).

The carrying amounts of all financial assets and liabilities of the Group and of the Company at the end of the reporting period approximated their fair values.

(i) There was no financial asset measured and recognised at fair value during the financial year.

# 3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Unless otherwise stated, the following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items that are considered material in relation to the financial statements.

# (a) Basis of preparation

The financial statements of the Group and the Company have been prepared in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards ("MFRS"), International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except as disclosed in this summary of material accounting policies.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with MFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. It also requires Directors to exercise their judgement in the process of applying the Group and the Company's accounting policies. Although these estimates and judgement are based on the Directors' best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may differ. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are material to the financial statements are disclosed in Note 3(h).

# 3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# (a) Basis of preparation (continued)

(i) Amendments and annual improvements to published standards that are effective and relevant to the Group and the Company:

The Group and the Company has applied the following amendments and annual improvements to published standards for the first time for the financial year beginning on 1 January 2023:

Amendments to MFRS 108 on "Disclosure of Accounting Policies" and "Definition of Accounting Estimates"  
Amendments to MFRS 101 "Classification of liabilities as current or non-current" ('2020 amendments')  
- Amendments to MFRS 112 "Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction" and "International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules"

The Group and the Company also adopted amendments to MFRS 101 and MFRS Practice Statement 2 on disclosure of accounting policies from 1 January 2023. The amendments impacted the disclosure of the accounting policy information in the financial statements but did not result in any changes to the accounting policies themselves.

The disclosure of "material" rather than "significant" accounting policies is required. The amendments provide guidance on the application of materiality to the disclosure of accounting policies, assisting entities to provide useful, entity-specific accounting policy information that users may need to understand the financial statements.

Management reviewed the accounting policies and made updates to the information disclosed in the respective notes to the financial statements.

Other than amendments to MFRS 101 and MFRS Practice Statement 2 stated above, the adoption of these amendments did not have any material impact on the amounts recognised in prior periods and is not expected to significantly affect the current or future periods.

(ii) Standards early adopted by the Group and the Company

There were no standards early adopted by the Group and by the Company.

# (a) Basis of preparation (continued)

(iii) Amendments to published standards that are applicable to the Group and the Company but not yet effective and have not been adopted by the Group and by the Company

A number of amendments to published standards are effective for the financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2024. The Group and the Company intends to adopt the following pronouncements that are applicable to the Group and the Company when they become effective:

Effective for financial year beginning on or after 1 January 2024

- The amendment to MFRS 101 'Non-current Liabilities with Covenants' specify that covenants of loan arrangements which an entity must comply with only after the reporting date would not affect classification of a liability as current or non-current at the reporting date. However, those covenants that an entity is required to comply with on or before the reporting date would affect classification of a liability as current or non-current, even if the covenant is only assessed after the reporting date.

The amendments shall be applied retrospectively.

- Amendments to MFRS 16 'Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback

The amendments specify the measurement of the lease liability arises in a sale and leaseback transaction that satisfies the requirement in MFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers' to be accounted for as a sale. In accordance with the amendments, the seller-lessee shall determine the "lease payments" or "revised lease payments" in a way that it does not result in the seller-lessee recognising any amount of the gain or loss that relate to the right of use it retains.

The amendments shall be applied retrospectively to sale and leaseback transactions entered into after the date when the seller-lessee initially applied MFRS 16.

Effective for financial year beginning on or after 1 January 2025

Amendments to MFRS 121 "The effect of changes in Foreign Exchange Rates" on "Lack of exchangeability

The amendment specifies on assessment to determine whether a currency is exchangeable into another currency or not. When a currency is not exchangeable into another currency, the spot exchange rate needs to be estimated. The objective in estimating the spot exchange rate at a measurement date is to determine the rate at which an orderly exchange transaction would take place at that date between market participants under prevailing economic conditions.

A framework is set out to estimate the spot exchange rate when exchangeability is lacking.

The amendments include accompanying new disclosures to help investors to understand the effects, risks and estimated rates and techniques used when a currency is not exchangeable.

# 3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# (a) Basis of preparation (continued)

(iii) Amendments to published standards that are applicable to the Group and the Company but not yet effective and have not been adopted by the Group and by the Company (continued)

The Group and the Company intend to adopt the following pronouncements that are applicable to the Group and the Company when they become effective:

Effective date yet to be determined by the Malaysian Accounting Standards Board

- Amendments to MFRS 10 "Consolidated Financial Statements" and MFRS 128 "Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures" on Sales or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture resolve a current inconsistency between MFRS 10 and MFRS 128.

The accounting treatment depends on whether the non-monetary assets sold or contributed to an associate or joint venture constitute a "business".

Full gain or loss shall be recognised by the investor where the non-monetary assets constitute a "business". If the assets do not meet the definition of a business, the gain or loss is recognised by the investor to the extent of the other investors' interests. In other words, the elimination of profits or losses resulting from "upstream" and "downstream" transactions between an investor and its associate or a joint venture rule is only applicable if the asset is not a business.

The amendments will only apply when an investor sells or contributes assets to its associate or joint venture. They are not intended to address accounting for the sale or contribution of assets by an investor in joint operation.

There is not expected to be any material impact to the financial statements of the Group and the Company arising from the amendments to published standards that are applicable, but yet to be effective.

# (b) Functional and presentation currency

Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group's and of the Company's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the "functional currency"). The financial statements of the Group and of the Company are presented in Ringgit Malaysia, which is the Company's functional and presentation currency.

# (c) Financial instruments

(i) Financial guarantee contracts

Financial guarantee contracts are contracts that require the Company to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due, in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument.

# Notes to the Financial Statements

for the financial year ended 31 December 2023 (continued)

# 3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# (c) Financial instruments (continued)

(i) Financial guarantee contracts (continued)

Financial guarantee contracts are recognised as a financial liability at the time the guarantee is issued. The liability is initially measured at fair value.

The fair value of financial guarantees is determined based on the present value of the difference in cash flows between the contractual payments required under the debt instrument and the payments that would be required without the guarantee, or the estimated amount that would be payable to a third party for assuming the obligations.

Financial guarantee contracts are subsequently measured at the higher of the amount determined in accordance with the expected credit loss model under MFRS 9 "Financial Instruments" and the amount initially recognised less cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the principles of MFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers', where appropriate.

# (d) Derivatives and hedging activities

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value at the end of each reporting period.

The accounting for subsequent changes in fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are classified as held for trading and accounted for at fair value through profit or loss. Changes in the fair value are recognised immediately in profit or loss and are included in other gains/(losses). Derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting are designated as either:

(i) Hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment (fair value hedge);  
(ii) Hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge); or  
(iii) Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge).

The Group documents at the inception of the hedge relationship, the economic relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items including whether changes in the cash flows of the hedging instruments are expected to offset changes in the cash flows of hedged items. The Group documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking its hedge transactions.

# Cash flow hedge

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in reserves within equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss within other gains/(losses).

Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss. The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of interest rate swaps hedging variable rate borrowings is recognised in profit or loss within finance income/cost at the same time as the interest expense on the hedged borrowings.

# Notes to the Financial Statements

for the financial year ended 31 December 2023 (continued)

# 3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# (d) Derivatives and hedging activities (continued)

Cash flow hedge (continued)

When the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset (for example, inventory or property, plant and equipment), the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are reclassified from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset. The deferred amounts are ultimately recognised in cost of goods sold in the case of inventory or in depreciation in the case of property, plant and equipment.

When a hedging instrument expires or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the accounting of any cumulative deferred gain or loss and deferred cost of hedging included in equity depends on the nature of the underlying hedged transaction. For cash flow hedge which resulted in the recognition of a non-financial asset, the cumulative amount in equity shall be included in the initial cost of the asset. For other cash flow hedges, the cumulative amount in equity is reclassified to profit or loss in the same period that the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss. When hedged future cash flows or forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss and deferred cost of hedging that was reported in equity is immediately reclassified to profit or loss within other gains/(losses).

For the financial year ended 31 December 2023, the Group has continued to apply the reliefs provided by the Amendments to MFRS 9 and MFRS 7 'Interest Rate Benchmark Reform ("IBOR") - Phase 1. The following is applicable upon the application of the Phase 2 amendments related to the IBOR reform:

(a) Hedge designation

When the Phase 1 amendments cease to apply, the Group will amend its hedge designation to reflect changes which are required by IBOR reform, but only to make one (1) or more of the following changes:

(i) designating an alternative benchmark rate (contractually or non-contractually specified) as a hedged risk;  
(ii) amending the description of the hedged item, including the description of the designated portion of the cash flows or fair value being hedged; or  
(iii) amending the description of the hedging instrument.

The Group will amend its hedge documentation to reflect this change in designation by the end of the reporting period in which the changes are made. These amendments to the hedge documentation do not require the Group to discontinue its hedge relationships.

(b) Amounts accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve

When the Group amends its hedge designation as described above, the accumulated amount outstanding in the cash flow hedge reserve is deemed to be based on the alternative benchmark rate. For discontinued hedging relationships, when the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged future cash flows were based has changed as required by IBOR reform, the amount accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve is also deemed to be based on the alternative benchmark rate for the purpose of assessing whether the hedged future cash flows are still expected to occur.

# (e) Income recognition

Revenue from contract with customers

(i) Sale of gas

The Group's revenue is mainly derived from the sales of natural gas to industrial, commercial and residential customers. The Group sell gas to the customers in various forms, namely natural gas, LPG and CNG.

As part of the customer's process to obtain gas supply from the Group, customers may be required to pay a connectivity charge to the Group (i.e. payment of capital contribution in order for the Group to connect the customer's premise to the natural gas distribution system ("NGDS") network). In the case of the Group, as the connectivity charge and the supply of gas are highly interdependent on one another to produce the output that the customer requires (i.e. the supply of gas), it is therefore not being capable to be distinct in the context of the supply of goods and services, and is treated as one single performance obligation.

Revenue from gas sales is recognised (net of discount and taxes collected on behalf) as and when the Group's customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits (i.e. the customers are able to utilise the gas for their benefit as and when the gas is being supplied) arising from the Group performing their obligations based on the terms of the contracts with the customers. Accordingly, revenue from the supply of gas is recognised over time, i.e. as and when the gas supplied is consumed by the customers. There is no element of financing present as the Group's sales are based on a credit term of 30 days from the date of the invoice.

(ii) Provision for tolling services

Revenue from provision of tolling services is recognised in the period in which the tolling activities are performed. There is no element of financing present as sales is based on a credit term of 22 to 24 days from the date of invoice.

(iii) Provision for metered services

Revenue from metered services comprise charges imposed to retail license holders, who are also the customers of the Group, in respect of billing and payment collection services provided on behalf of the retail license holders to the respective customers. It is recognised in the period in which the activities are performed. There is no element of financing present as sales is based on a credit term of 30 days from the date of invoice.

(iv) Fee from management services

Fee from management services is recognised as revenue over time during the period in which the services are rendered.

Revenue from other sources

(i) Dividend income

Dividend income is recognised when the Group's and the Company's right to receive payment is established.

# 3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# (f) Property, plant and equipment

(i) Depreciation

Freehold land is not depreciated as it has an indefinite life. Depreciation on capital work-in-progress commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.

Other property, plant and equipment are depreciated on the straight-line method to allocate the cost to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, summarised as follows:

<table><tr><td>Buildings</td><td>50 years</td></tr><tr><td>Motor vehicles</td><td>5 years</td></tr><tr><td>Office and gas equipment</td><td>3 to 5 years</td></tr><tr><td>Furniture and fittings</td><td>5 years</td></tr><tr><td>Office renovation</td><td>3 years</td></tr><tr><td>Pipeline and distribution systems</td><td>10 to 30 years</td></tr></table>

# (g) Share capital

(i) Classification

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Other shares are classifies as equity and/or liability according to the economic substance of the particular instrument.

(ii) Dividend distribution

Liability is recognised for the amount of any dividend declared, being appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of the Group, on or before the end of the reporting period but not distributed at the end of the reporting period.

# (h) Critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements

(i) Depreciation policy

The depreciation policy of the pipelines system adopted by the Directors, assumes that there are no changes expected to the technology and legal environment in the industry in which the Group operates in, as well as the manner of which the assets are being used. In addition, given the significance of the pipeline network used to supply gas to the end customers, the Group has competitive advantage as it would be difficult for any new entrant to replicate, and therefore the current useful life continues to be reasonable.

Estimates and judgements are continuously evaluated by the Directors and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the technology and legal environment in the industry in which the Group operates in, as well as the manner of which the assets are being used could impact the economic useful lives and the residual values of these assets. Therefore, future depreciation charges could be revised if there is an increase in economic useful lives of the pipelines systems.

# Notes to the Financial Statements

for the financial year ended 31 December 2023 (continued)

# 3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# (h) Critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements (continued)

Estimates and judgements are continually being evaluated by the Directors and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

(i) Depreciation policy (continued)

The Group's carrying amount of the property, plant and equipment as at 31 December 2023 will be increased by approximately RM23,442,000 if the useful lives of the pipelines system are extended from 30 years to 40 years.

(ii) Accrual for gas costs

The Directors have also taken into account the terms of business which the Group has with its gas suppliers where the title and ownership of the gas shall be transferred to the Group upon delivery of gas to the Group's pipeline. Any change in the customers' consumption patterns and the terms of business which the Group has with its gas suppliers will have an effect on the accrual for gas costs.

(iii) Revenue recognition arising from the Group's rights and obligations under the Incentive-Based Regulation ("IBR") and Third Party Access ("TPA")

The Directors have applied judgement in applying the revenue recognition policy based on the Group's business model, its relationships and contracts with the customers and its rights and obligations under the IBR and TPA. The judgement includes the assessment of the Group's rights in dealing with and charging the customers, taking into consideration the Group's responsibility for securing and expanding their customer base and bearing the credit risk of the customers.

The Energy Commission ("EC") implemented the TPA on 1 January 2020, which entails the liberalisation of the Malaysian gas market whereby third parties are expected to be involved in the retailing of gas to end customers. IBR allows the distribution licensee (i.e. Gas Malaysia Distribution Sdn. Bhd.) or the EC to propose additional components for revenue adjustment, for which revenue cap and price cap adjustments are part of the components. The revenue cap and price cap adjustments are used by the EC to ensure that the Group is able to pass through the variances arising from the estimated and actual firm capacity reservations.

Under this mechanism, the Group's claims and undertakings are such that any over or under recovery of revenue arising from the variances between actual and forecasted firm capacity reservations used in the determination of tariff rates for the utilisation of the Natural Gas Distribution System ("NGDS") would be payable to or reimbursable from the Government via revenue cap and price cap adjustments. The variance would be recognised as part of revenue in the period when the variances in the firm capacity reservations occur, whereby the submitted forecast and actual firm capacity reservation is submitted to the EC annually.

The Directors have considered the Group's rights and obligations with the customers and the Government under the IBR and TPA in determining the revenue recognition for the financial year as well as the recovery of the outstanding balance as at the reporting date. Any change to the approved submitted forecast and actual firm capacity reservation by the EC will impact the revenue recognised and the recovery of the outstanding balance. Refer to Note 23 to the financial statements for further details.

# 11 EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic earnings per ordinary share and diluted earnings per ordinary share are calculated by dividing the net profit for the financial year attributable to equity holders of the Group by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the financial year.

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">Group</td></tr><tr><td>2023</td><td>2022</td></tr><tr><td>Net profit for the financial year attributable to equity holders of the Company (RM’000)</td><td>383,399</td><td>389,543</td></tr><tr><td>Weighted average number of ordinary shares (&#x27;000)</td><td>1,284,000</td><td>1,284,000</td></tr><tr><td>Basic earnings per share (RM)</td><td>0.30</td><td>0.30</td></tr><tr><td>Diluted earnings per share (RM)</td><td>0.30</td><td>0.30</td></tr></table>

# 17 TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES (CONTINUED)

As at 31 December 2023, trade receivables of RM37,988,000 (2022: RM44,063,000) for the Group were past due but not impaired. These relate to a number of independent customers for whom there is no history of default. The aging analysis of these trade receivables (excluding other receivables) are as follows:

Trade receivables that are neither past due nor impaired mainly relate to industrial users, which are nationally dispersed and covers a spectrum of industries with a variety of end markets and have high credit worthiness. As described in Note 2(b), the Group requires the customers to pledge a bank guarantee or place cash deposit as collateral. Trade receivables of the Group are secured by bank guarantees and customers' deposits of RM1,865,828,000 (2022: RM1,739,379,000) and RM78,298,000 (2022: RM78,390,000) respectively. Due to these factors, the Group's and the Company's historical experience shows that the impairment loss allowance on trade receivables has been adequate.

As at 31 December 2023, trade receivables amounting to RM11,323,000 (2022: RM11,287,000) for the Group and RM6,478,000 (2022: RM6,478,000) for the Company were impaired and provided for. The individually impaired receivables mainly relate to customers which have defaulted in payment.

Subject to the agreement of the Inland Revenue Board of Malaysia, the estimated amount of deferred tax assets calculated at the current tax rate which have not been recognised in the Group's financial statements, as the Directors are of the view that it is not probable that sufficient future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences and tax losses can be utilised, are as follows:

# NOTES:

# 1. IMPORTANT NOTICE

The Broadcast Venue of the  $33^{\text{rd}}$  AGM is strictly for the purpose of complying with Section 327(2) of the Companies Act 2016 (the "Act") which requires the Chairman of the Meeting to be at the main venue. AGM will be conducted online from the Broadcast Venue. Members can attend, participate and vote in the meeting remotely via Boardroom website at https://meeting boardroomlimited.my. At the Broadcast Venue, only the essential individuals are physically present to organise the virtual  $33^{\text{rd}}$  AGM.  
2. This Agenda item is meant for discussion only, as the provision of Section 340(1)(a) of the Act does not require a formal approval of the members/shareholders for the Audited Financial Statements. Hence, this Agenda item is not put forward for voting.  
3. In respect of deposited securities, only members whose names appear on the Record of Depositors on 23 May 2024 (General Meeting Record of Depositors) shall be eligible to attend, participate, speak and vote at the meeting.  
4. A member of the Company shall be entitled to appoint another person as his/her proxy to attend, participate, speak and vote at the meeting in his stead. A proxy need not be a member of the Company.  
5. A member shall not be entitled to appoint more than two (2) proxies. Where a member appoints two (2) proxies, the appointments shall be invalid unless he specifies the proportion of his shareholdings to be represented by each proxy.
