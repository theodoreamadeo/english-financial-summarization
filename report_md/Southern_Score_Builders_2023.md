Tan Sri Datuk Seri Gan Yu Chai ("Tan Sri Datuk Seri Gan") was appointed to the Board of SSBB on 9 November 2022 as the Managing Director, following the completion of the Company's regularisation plan. Tan Sri Datuk Seri Gan has been serving on the board of Southern Score since 7 June 2012. He is responsible for developing and executing business strategies that contribute to the business growth of Southern Score, and managing its corporate development.

Tan Sri Datuk Seri Gan graduated with a Diploma in Electronic Engineering from the Institute of Further Technical Education, Malaysia in 1989. He has more than 30 years of experience in the property development and construction industries. To date, Tan Sri Datuk Seri Gan has successfully completed over 20 property developments projects in the Klang Valley area, mainly in the vicinity of Kuala Lumpur.

Upon graduation, Tan Sri Datuk Seri Gan began his career as a business partner in Unigreen Hardware Supplies, a building materials trading business co-owned by his family. He was initially tasked to oversee the sales department before taking over the management and operations of this business.

Tan Sri Datuk Seri Gan's entry into the property development arena began with the successful completion of Pelangi Condominium in Kuala Lumpur in 2002, a project carried out by Inner Glamour Sdn Bhd. Building on this initial triumph, he went on to establish a legacy of thriving developments through his flagship company, the Platinum Victory Group. This journey has seen the realization of numerous prosperous projects, including the Platinum Hill condominium series in Taman Melati Utama, the Platinum Lake condominium series in Danau Kota Setapak, and the Platinum Suites series on Jalan Sultan Ismail in Kuala Lumpur, all executed under the entities of Platinum Victory Sdn

Bhd, Platinum Victory Development Sdn Bhd, and Platinum Victory Property Sdn Bhd. To date, Tan Sri Datuk Seri Gan's leadership has guided the successful completion of over 30 development projects, and he continues to actively shape the landscape of the property development industry.

In 2010, leveraging on his experience and knowledge in construction and project management skills, Tan Sri Datuk Seri Gan decided to venture downstream into construction. This led to the establishment of Southern Score to pursue opportunities in the provision of construction services mainly for high-rise residential buildings.

Under Tan Sri Datuk Seri Gan's leadership, Southern Score participated in tenders for public and private sector construction projects. Subsequently, in 2015, Southern Score was awarded its first construction services project, namely the PR1MA Jalan Jubilee project by PR1MA Corporation Berhad.

Tan Sri Datuk Seri Gan does not hold any directorship in other public or listed companies.

# Dear Esteemed Shareholders,

On behalf of the Board of Directors of Southern Score Builders Berhad ("Southern Score Builders"), I am pleased to present Southern Score Builders Annual Report and audited financial statements for the 6-month financial period ended 30 June 2023 ("FPE2023"). The audited accounts of the Group contained in this report reflect a period of six (6) months, following a change in the financial year end of the subsidiary acquired (i.e. Southern Score) following the completion of the Company's regularisation plan on 9 November 2022.

TAN SRI DATUK SERI  
GAN YU CHAI  
(P.S.M)(S.M.W)

Managing Director

![](images/02a5635ee547347da46d758df3ac9e457195d42e4e9eec0259613416c6929f6c.jpg)

In the past year, the experienced management of Southern Score Builders have undertaken a monumental task to not only restructure but also to transform the Group into a technology-driven construction services business. Our efforts successfully averted a potential delisting by Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad, and we are pleased to report that shareholders' equity has rebounded to a surplus of RM149.0 million as at 30 June 2023. Notably, the Group also boasts total assets of RM197.5 million whilst total liabilities amount to a modest RM48.5 million as at 30 June 2023.

Our regularisation plan was completed on 9 November 2022 and with that, Southern Score Builders has successfully exited the GN3 status.

The outcome of the restructuring efforts surpassed our expectations, with the Group achieving a net profit of RM25.3 million for FPE2023. Furthermore, we achieved a remarkable net profit margin of  $25.8\%$  during this period.

The Board's strategic decision to venture into the construction business proved timely, as the Malaysian construction landscape rebounded convincingly post-COVID-19 pandemic. More opportunities continued to emerge in the construction sector as it grew by  $8.1\%$  year-on-year ("y-o-y") in the second quarter of 2023, which is the fifth consecutive quarter of expansion. The Government of Malaysia's renewed focus in boosting construction activities via increased public investments in infrastructure projects would also be positive for the Group's outlook.

The Group's venture into construction began with the acquisition of Southern Score Sdn Bhd ("SSSB"), a G7 contractor, as part of the Company's regularisation plan. Following the acquisition, Southern Score Builders began to be involved in the provision of construction management services, mainly for high-rise residential buildings. The acquisition came with a cumulative net profit guarantee of RM80 million over the three-year period from 2022 to 2024. Notably, up to FPE 2023, SSSB has seen the delivery of RM54.4 million out of this guarantee.

# REVIEW OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

During the FPE 2023, Southern Score Builders posted a net profit of RM25.31 million, against a revenue of RM97.93 million.

As anticipated, some of the existing projects were nearing completion as scheduled, the Group witnessed lower progress for such projects. This has, to an extent, resulted in reduced revenue recognition for Southern Score Builders in the 6-month period. However, the Management has been actively replenishing the orderbook by tendering for new projects from both public and private sectors.

As at 30 June 2023, the order book value stood at RM602.7 million, offering earnings visibility for the next three to four years. The majority of these secured projects, accounting for  $63\%$ , came from the private sector, with the remaining  $37\%$  being contracts from the public sector.

Operating margin for the 6-month period was recorded at an impressive  $33\%$ .

Southern Score Builders' financial position has improved substantially in FPE2023, with the Group registering a net asset position of RM149.0 million. As at 30 June 2023, the Group's total assets stood at RM197.5 million, while total liabilities were RM48.5 million. Meanwhile, the Group had cash and bank balances including fixed deposits and short-term deposit placement of RM79.5 million as at 30 June 2023, against total borrowings of RM5.4 million.

# MOVING FORWARD

The Malaysian construction industry is expected to continue its growth in the upcoming quarters, especially in 2024, amidst the improvement in market sentiment and the Government's commitment to increase its investments in infrastructure and affordable housing projects. The Government's decision to increase the 12th Malaysia Plan's development expenditure ceiling to RM415 billion would benefit several sectors, among which is construction. In the Medium-Term Review of the 12th Malaysia Plan, 11 major infrastructure projects were mentioned. Among them were the remaining phase 1B of Sabah Pan Borneo Highway, Penang Light Rail Transit and Phase 2 of Sabah-Sarawak Link Road. The Government also aims to build 500,000 affordable homes by the end of 2025. By end-2022, a total of 108,373 units of affordable homes have been built, with over 390,000 units to be built between 2023 to 2025. Southern Score Builders is likely to be one of the beneficiaries of such efforts, given its prior track record including as a turnkey contractor for the development of PR1MA Jalan Jubilee. The Group is also well experienced in providing civil works such as road and drainage, and water reticulation and sewerage package works.

![](images/2604586bf66f61783eb5f56b160558932b796c9b15d26d4e995dd604d97a67ad.jpg)

![](images/241f9721197d88ac7a3944b6fa62b2863f69994db0187cd6a41fcbd2b0fc5e7a.jpg)

The Group remains positive of its prospects, supported by our ongoing projects and potential to secure new contracts in the financial year ending 30 June 2024, as the post pandemic economic recovery gains momentum. Southern Score Builders has continuously participated in projects tendering in the public and private sector and will remain committed to exploring opportunities which could yield long term and sustainable revenue growth.

Going forward, an exciting growth opportunity for the Group that offers superior margins lies in our endeavor to pioneer robotic construction technologies within Malaysia. This aligns seamlessly with our longstanding objective of venturing into new markets and broadening our revenue streams. On 2 June 2023, Southern Score Builders had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with MCC Overseas (M) Sdn Bhd and Guangdong Bright Dream Robotics Co Ltd ("MOU") to establish a partnership aimed at implementing and developing robotic construction technologies in Malaysia.

![](images/87b7d2a4dc51f94ab3050800f8bd0ae8eeddbce76fe9f4159cfbf6b1112c7ae3.jpg)

Via the MOU, the Group will be venturing into the integration of automation and robotics in the design, manufacturing and construction processes of Industrialised Building Systems ("IBS") in Malaysia. Robotic construction technology has the potential to enhance construction speed and accuracy. Once the technology becomes commercially viable, the Group has plans to offer the services to other construction companies in Malaysia. At the moment, Southern Score Builders and its partners are currently in the testing and research phase for the robotic construction technology.

Southern Score Builders has always been a firm believer in embracing advanced technology. To date, we have widely implemented the IBS across the majority of our development and construction projects, aiming to enhance both productivity and quality. It exemplifies our dedication to refining operations and maintaining competitiveness within the industry.

# APPRECIATION

In closing, I would like to extend my gratitude to all stakeholders of Southern Score Builders for your unwavering support and loyalty to the Group, amid internal and external challenges in previous years. Spearheaded by the strategic decisions made by the Board and the Management of Southern Score Builders, I am highly confident that the Group will be better positioned moving forward, delivering value to shareholders and enhancing our financial performance. On this note, I would also like to convey my sincere appreciation to the Management and employees of Southern Score Builders for their relentless efforts and commitment in taking the Group to greater heights.

Following our successful restructuring, Southern Score Builders is on the right trajectory in becoming a leading construction management services provider in the country. Our ongoing efforts to accelerate the adoption of technology for the construction sectors will open up growth opportunities for the Group as we move forward. With continued great support from all stakeholders of Southern Score Builders, I am confident that we will achieve these milestones.

# MANAGEMENT

# DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS

Listed on the ACE Market of Bursa Malaysia, Southern Score Builders Berhad ("Southern Score Builders" or "the Group") is involved in the provision of construction management services, especially for high-rise residential buildings, as well as civil works such as road and drainage, and water reticulation and sewerage package works. Southern Score Builders was formed in November 2022 following the completion of the reverse takeover exercise of G Neptune Berhad by Southern Score Sdn Bhd.

Southern Score Builders is well-positioned to chart a new profitable corporate journey ahead, led by an experienced and technically strong management team. We are exhilarated to witness the vote of confidence by our new and existing clients in requiring our services for their development projects.

# Management Discussion & Analysis

# FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE REVIEW

For the FPE 2023, Southern Score Builders registered a revenue of RM97.9 million and a net profit of RM25.3 million.

There are no comparative year-on-year figures. On 8 February 2023, Southern Score Sdn Bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group, had changed its financial year end from 31 December to 30 June so as to coincide with the financial year end of the Group. As such, Southern Score Builders first set of audited financial statements following the change in financial year end covers the period from 1 January 2023 to 30 June 2023. The acquisition of Southern Score Sdn Bhd as part of the Company's regularisation plan delivered a profit after tax of RM25.3 million for FPE 2023.

Notably, the Group's revenue in FPE 2023 was affected by the lower progress specifically in the last quarter of the year ("Q4FY2023") for projects which were nearing completion and the absence of significant project delivery milestones. That said, Southern Score Builders overall profitability was not negatively affected by the dip in revenue as it benefited from lower cost of sales in FPE 2023, arising from reduction in the estimated gross development cost for one of the Group's key projects.

Revenue for FPE 2023 was driven by the execution of key projects such as Vista Sentul Residences (RM13.6 million), Vista Harmony Sentul Residences (RM20.5 million) and Berlian Setapak 2 Residences (RM12.5 million), piling works for PV 22 Residences (RM50.7 million) as well as site clearance and relocation works for PT27043, Mukim Batu (RMo.6 million).

# Sturdy Balance Sheet & Liquidity Position

Southern Score Builders enjoys a healthy balance sheet position. As at 30 June 2023, Southern Score Builders held cash and bank balances including fixed deposits and short term deposit placement of RM79.5 million. Our cash and bank balances far exceeded the Group's total borrowings of RM5.4 million. Southern Score Builders is in a strong position to meet its debt obligations, fund operational and expansion needs as well as to reward its shareholders.

The Group's net assets as at 30 June 2023 stood at RM149 million, translating to a net asset per share of RMo.07. The Group's current ratio improved to 3.9 times as compared to 3.0 times as of 31 December 2022. This indicates that the Group is highly capable of meeting financial obligations in the short term.

With regards to dividend payout, on 20 February 2023, the Board declared an interim dividend of 1 sen per ordinary share amounting to RM22.73 million in respect of the financial period ended 30 June 2023. The said dividends were subsequently paid on 18 April 2023. This represents a payout ratio of  $90\%$ .

# Capital Expenditure

Southern Score Builders adoption of an asset-light model has been instrumental in our agile approach to managing capital expenditure. In this framework, we avoid setting concrete plans for capital outlays, opting instead for a just-in-time, need-based approach. This strategy ensures that any capital expenditure is efficiently allocated, primarily to alleviate bottlenecks should there be a surge in demand for our services. By maintaining this flexibility, we are well-prepared to swiftly respond to evolving market conditions and seize opportunities, positioning ourselves for sustained growth and efficiency in the ever-changing and increasingly technology driven landscape of the construction industry.

# Management Discussion & Analysis

# ANTICIPATED OR KNOWN RISKS

# Market Risk

The economic growth slowdown, both in Malaysia and globally, poses a significant risk to the demand for Southern Score Builders services in the market. Construction activities are typically among the first sectors affected by a subdued market sentiment, potentially leading to reduced investments in public infrastructure projects and the development of residential and commercial properties. This, in turn, directly impacts our Group as we specialize in providing construction management services.

Southern Score Builders acknowledges the prevailing market conditions and has proactively implemented a range of measures to fortify its business against these challenges. We are actively pursuing strategic collaborations, partnerships, and alliances on both domestic and international fronts to enhance our operational resilience and expand our market presence.

# Raw Material Risk

Post COVID-19 pandemic, the risk of supply disruption for building materials has reduced significantly. However, global geopolitical instability and the slowdown in major economies continue to pose some degree of risks on the supply of raw materials. On our part, we have minimised the risk of any interruption as we procure most of our raw materials from suppliers within Malaysia. In addition, we also have long-term business relationships with our suppliers, hence this allows us to coordinate the supply of raw materials without major disruptions. Southern Score Builders also minimises the impact from higher raw material prices by procuring building materials in bulk and at highly competitive rates.

# Competition Risk

Southern Score Builders is operating in a highly competitive environment. Not only is the Group competing with the existing business rivals offering similar services such as building construction; infrastructure services; foundation & geotechnics and IBS, but we also face competition from new entrants into this space. However, given our established track record in various multi-million-ringgit projects, large customer base, experienced management and our strength in technology adoption, Southern Score Builders is well-positioned to set ourselves apart from other players in the construction industry. Southern Score Builders will strive to remain competitive by keeping abreast and implementing the latest IBS and construction technology.

# MARKET OUTLOOK

In June 2023, the World Bank had cautioned that the lagged effects of monetary tightening, as well as restrictive credit conditions, are expected to weigh on global economic activities in the second half of 2023, with weakness persisting into 2024. Pronounced deceleration in growth is expected across the board, affecting advanced and developing economies. The World Bank projects global economic growth to decline to  $2.1\%$  in 2023, before a tepid recovery to  $2.4\%$  in 2024.

As for Malaysia, the World Bank forecasts a growth of  $4.3\%$  and  $4.2\%$  in 2023 and 2024 respectively. The projection for 2023 was within the Malaysian government's official guidance of  $4\%$  to  $5\%$ . Economic growth in Malaysia is affected by external factors following the economic weakness in major trading partners and foreign investment contributors. Nevertheless, the Malaysian economy remains supported by resilient domestic demand on the back of a more controlled headline inflation and the accommodative Overnight Policy Rate which continues to be below the 2019 level.

With regard to the construction industry, the Department of Statistics Malaysia reported that Malaysia's construction activities rose for the fifth straight quarter in the April to June 2023 period, but also noted that the pace has slowed in the second quarter. The sector recorded an increase of  $8.1\%$  year-on-year in value of work done to RM32.4 billion for the second quarter of 2023. Moving forward, amidst the softness in overall economic sentiment, the construction industry is expected to continue to report positive growth, backed by pick-up in government projects and continued expansion in private sector output.

# OUR STRATEGIES

With the promising opportunities arising in the Malaysian market, Southern Score Builders is enthusiastic about the road ahead. We are proactively expanding our order book by participating in project tenders supported by both the public and private sectors. Furthermore, we are intensifying our commitment to becoming Malaysia's foremost construction services provider that champions the adoption of robotic construction technology. Our objective is to enhance productivity, optimize costs over the long term, and spearhead sustainable construction methods in the industry.

# Expansion of project portfolio

Guided by a seasoned management team, the Group is resolutely dedicated to securing a portfolio of projects characterized by increased contract values and expanded scopes. We maintain an unwavering commitment to actively engaging in project tenders within both public and private sectors, striving to achieve an ambitious internal target success rate of  $60\%$  from the projects tendered. With economic uncertainties expected to wane as we enter 2024, and with the Malaysian government's renewed emphasis on construction and infrastructure projects, we eagerly anticipate an expanded role in government projects, particularly with a dedicated focus on the development of affordable housing.

The Group will continue to explore opportunities in other projects which could yield long term and sustainable revenue. Southern Score Builders is open to forging partnerships to undertake new projects and to venture into new markets. We actively seek partnerships with industry players, regulatory bodies, and technology providers. This collaborative ethos facilitates knowledge exchange, enhances expertise, and positions us at the forefront of industry trends. Our efforts in the area of robotic IBS is one such example.

# Management Discussion & Analysis

# Increased focus on technology

The strategic adoption of cutting-edge technologies, such as Building Information Modelling (BIM) and robotics, sets us apart as pioneers in the construction sector. This positions us well for future growth and efficiency gains. For example, the integration of the BIM technology proved to be useful for auditing our construction plans as it minimises human error, optimises costs and ensures the safety of our workers on site. Moving forward, the Group is committed to further embrace additional technologies as we undertake more projects in the future. On 2 June 2023, the Group announced its venture into robotics IBS and artificial intelligence following the Memorandum of Understanding with MCC Overseas (M) Sdn Bhd and Guangdong Bright Dream Robotics Co Ltd. This collaboration is set to revolutionise Malaysia's housing sector as Southern Score Builders will be venturing into the integration of automation and robotics in the design, manufacturing and construction processes of IBS in Malaysia. The initial aim is to construct 5,000 homes through this collaboration.

In September 2023, Southern Score Builders achieved a momentous milestone with the deployment of a robotic system at Vista Harmoni Residences, Kuala Lumpur, marking a watershed moment in the annals of the construction industry. This site has been designated as both a testing ground and a data collection battleground to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of utilising three specific robots. As we employ greater scale of technology in more upcoming projects, it would firmly establish the Group as a frontrunner within the industry.

# Diversification of market footprint

At the moment, our completed and ongoing projects are predominantly in Kuala Lumpur, serving high-rise buildings. While the Group continues to see encouraging demand for its services in the capital city, our strategic growth plans encompass geographical expansion in order to diversify our revenue sources. This approach would mitigate risks associated with market fluctuations and bolster our resilience in varying economic conditions.

Looking ahead, we aim to expand our presence into several states namely, Johor, Seremban and Penang. The management of Southern Score Builders foresees these new markets to provide a strong growth catalyst for the Group and the opportunity to maintain the Group's commendable margin level. Our forward-looking approach is underpinned by a comprehensive vision that accounts for market dynamics, technological advancements, and sustainability imperatives. We are poised to capitalise on emerging opportunities and navigate challenges with agility.

# Embracing greener operations

The management of Southern Score Builders strongly believes in the importance of a sustainable business model. We seek to incorporate green practices from a project's inception. By factoring sustainability considerations into the initial design, we can optimise the building's layout, orientation, and systems to minimise energy consumption and waste. Assessing the local regulatory landscape, incentives, and tax benefits that support green initiatives can significantly offset upfront costs, making green construction more financially viable.

We consistently invest in educating clients, investors, and stakeholders about the long-term benefits of green initiatives that can foster a willingness to invest in sustainable practices and technologies. The Group also implements agile project management techniques that allow for continuous evaluation and adjustment and can identify potential cost-saving opportunities throughout the construction process.

# ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

I wish to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to the Southern Score Builders family, including the board members, senior management and the rest of our employees. Your excellent contributions have put the Group on the right trajectory towards sustainable growth. I would also like to express my sincerest gratitude to our clients, business partners and shareholders for being supportive of our growth journey during the financial period under review.

Looking ahead, I am confident that Southern Score Builders is ever-ready to embark on new challenges and market opportunities as we strive to be a world-class construction management services outfit, while delivering improved value to our stakeholders.

# II. BOARD COMPOSITION

# 1. Composition and Diversity

The Board recognises the value of a diverse and inclusive composition, believing that it harnesses the unique strengths of its members to effectively steer the company and maintain its competitive edge. To ensure this, the Board, through its NRC, conducts an annual review of its size and composition. This evaluation aims to confirm that the Board possesses the appropriate size, diversity, and independence to align with the Company's objectives and strategic goals.

The Board consists of one (1) Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman, one (1) Non-Independent Non-Executive Director, two (2) Independent Non-Executive Directors and three (3) Executive Directors. This complies with Paragraph 15.02(1) of the AMLR which requires at least two (2) Directors or one-third (1/3) of the board to be Independent Directors. In the event of any vacancy in the Board of Directors resulting in non-compliance with Para 15.02(1) of the AMLR, the Company must fill the vacancy within 3 months. A brief profile of each Director is presented in pages 7 to 14 of this Annual Report.

The Directors bring a wealth of diverse knowledge, skills, and competencies to the Board, enabling them to make active, informed, and positive contributions to the Group's management, business operations, and strategic development. The appointments of both the Board and Senior Management are based on objective criteria, merit, and a commitment to diversity, encompassing skills, experience, age, cultural and socio-economic backgrounds, and gender.

While the Board acknowledges the importance of promoting gender diversity and aims to increase female representation in both the Board and Senior Management in the future, it has chosen not to establish specific targets. The focus remains on having the right mix of skills and competencies rather than merely percentages. Currently, there are two (2) women serving on the Board, representing approximately  $28.6\%$  of female representation.

Diversity at the Senior Management level fosters constructive debates and leads to better decision-making, particularly in today's rapidly changing environment. The Board values the diversity of perspectives and experiences at the Senior Management level, recognizing the advantages it brings to decision-making and competitiveness.

An ongoing focus on Board composition allows the NRC to maintain a well-balanced blend of fresh insights from recently appointed Directors. With a moderately sized Board, it incorporates a mix of entrepreneurship, business acumen, and professional expertise across various domains, including business and risk management, finance (including audit, tax, and accounting), and the technical aspects relevant to the Group's industries. The collective business, management, and professional experience, along with knowledge and expertise, possessed by Board members, provides the essential competencies necessary for diverse and objective perspectives on the Group's business and strategic direction.

The Board Diversity Policy is included in the Board Charter of the Company and is available for reference on the Group's website at www.southernscore.com.my.

# 2. Independence

The Board places great importance on having Directors who are not only capable and willing to make decisions in the best interest of shareholders but also free from any conflicts of interest. These Directors are expected to be independent of Management, which means they should be able to carry out their duties and express their views without any hindrance caused by personal relationships or business ties.

Presently, the Board has two (2) Independent Non-Executive Directors, namely Ms Phe Kheng Peng and Ms Too Siew Mooi. Neither of them holds any shares in the company nor are they employed by the Group. Furthermore, they do not have any relationships that could potentially influence their impartial judgment.

# 2. Independence (Cont'd)

Consistent with the guidelines established by the Code and the Board Charter, the tenure of an Independent Non-Executive Director should not exceed a cumulative term of nine (9) years. Once this nine-year period is reached, an Independent Director may continue to serve on the Board. However, the Board is required to provide justification, and subject to obtaining approval from shareholders, it may retain an Independent Non-Executive Director who has served for nine years or more. As of the date of this statement, none of the Independent Non-Executive Directors has completed nine (9) years of service since their appointment.

The Board conducts an annual assessment of the independence of Independent Non-Executive Directors as part of the annual Board assessment process. This assessment is conducted based on the criteria set by Bursa Securities. The Board is content with the level of independence demonstrated by all Independent Non-Executive Directors.

# 3. Board Appointments and Re-election of Directors

The appointment of Directors to the Board of SSBB follows a structured, thorough, and transparent procedure. The Board, through the NRC, assesses the following factors when considering the appointment of new Directors and the re-election of retiring Directors:

(a) the composition requirements for the Board and its committees;  
(b) the candidate's age, education background, experience, skills, knowledge, expertise, integrity, conflict of interest or any potential conflict of interest and other qualities which are relevant for the Board to discharge his or her responsibilities in an effective and competent manner;  
(c) the candidate's independence (for the appointment/ re-election of Independent and Non-Executive Director);  
(d) the candidate's ability to allocate time and commitment to attend to the Group's affairs; and  
(e) the annual assessment of the candidate (for the re-election of retiring Director).

Pursuant to the Company's Constitution, one-third (1/3) of the Board is subject to retirement by rotation at each AGM provided always that each Director shall retire at least once in every three (3) years and the retiring Director shall be eligible for re-election. Further, a retiring Director shall retain office until the conclusion of the AGM at which he retires.

Upon the recommendation of the NRC, the Board has confirmed that the following Directors who are retiring and seeking re-election at the 20th AGM have been assessed and found to continue performing effectively and demonstrating commitment:-

<table><tr><td>DIRECTORS</td><td>DESIGNATION</td></tr><tr><td>Tan Sri Datuk Seri Gan Yu Chai
(Clause 118)</td><td>(Managing Director)</td></tr><tr><td>Chai Tham Poh
(Clause 118)</td><td>(Non-Independent Non-Executive Director)</td></tr></table>

# 4. Annual Assessment

The NRC bears the responsibility of conducting an annual evaluation of the performance and effectiveness of the entire Board, the various Board Committees, and individual Directors. This evaluation process is overseen by the NRC Chairman and facilitated with the assistance of the Company Secretary, who administers questionnaires to gather feedback.

The NRC had on 24 October 2023 assessed the effectiveness of the Board, its Committees and the contribution of each Director by identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the Board for the financial year 2023.

The Board's evaluation process encompasses several key aspects, including the performance assessment of the Board and its various Committees, self-evaluation by Directors, and an evaluation of the independence of Independent Directors. These assessments revolve primary areas relating to board structure, boardroom activities, Board and Chairman's roles and responsibilities, Board's roles and responsibilities in dealing with ESG issues and Board Committees' roles and responsibilities. For Directors' self-evaluation, specific criteria are considered, including their fit and appropriateness, ability and competence, personal qualities, mix of skills, technical knowledge, objectivity, and their level of engagement and contribution during Board and Committee meetings.

The Board expressed satisfaction with the evaluation outcomes. It was confident that the skills and experiences of the current Directors align with the requirements outlined in the skills matrix. Additionally, it affirmed that the Chairman possesses the leadership qualities necessary to safeguard the interests of stakeholders and ensure the Group's profitability. The Directors also demonstrated their commitment by dedicating the requisite time and effort to fulfill their responsibilities to the Company and the Group throughout the year. The NRC concurred with the re-appointment of existing members to the various Board Committees for the upcoming year.

# 5. Directors Training

All Directors have attended the Mandatory Accreditation Programme as required by the AMLR.

# III. REMUNERATION

The Company's approach to determining the remuneration of Directors and Senior Management is driven by the objective of offering equitable and competitive compensation. This strategy aims to attract and retain a high-caliber team that benefits the Company. The remuneration packages for Executive Directors and Senior Management comprise a fixed component (in the form of a base salary and, where applicable, fixed allowances determined by the Group's Human Resource policies) and variable components (which would normally comprise of annual bonus) together with benefits-in-kind, if any to reward performance that supports the Group's strategy and creates sustainable long-term value for shareholders.

When assessing the structure and level of Directors' fees for Non-Executive Directors, the NRC takes into account the roles and responsibilities and time commitment of Directors. The NRC also benchmarks against industry peers' practices, the demands and complexities associated with the Company's operations, and its performance. Each Non-Executive Director receives a fixed base fee, and a meeting allowance for attendance at Board, Board Committee, and General Meetings. The fees and benefits for Directors are proposed by the NRC for the Board consideration for tabling to the shareholders for approval at the AGM. Notably, Directors abstain from voting to approve their own fees and benefits.

The Remuneration Policy is outlined in the Board Charter and is accessible for reference on the Group's website at www.southernscore.com.my.

Additionally, the NRC conducts an annual review of the remuneration packages for Senior Management. This assessment considers factors such as Company and Group performance, individual performance against key performance indicators, and the requisite qualifications, skills, and experience. Comparable market and industry data is also taken into account.

The Directors' remuneration paid/payable for the financial year/period ended 30 June 2023 of the Company and the Group on an individual basis is set out below:

The ARMC's Terms of Reference ("TOR") stipulate that any former partner of external audit firm must observe a cooling-off period of at least three (3) years before being eligible for appointment as a member of the ARMC.

The NRC conducts an annual assessment of the composition of the ARMC and subsequently recommends its composition to the Board for approval. This process ensures that all ARMC members meet the criteria of independence, financial literacy, and a clear understanding of matters falling under the ARMC's purview.

# 2. External Auditors

The ARMC conducts an annual assessment to evaluate the suitability, objectivity, and independence of the external auditors. In this evaluation, the ARMC takes into consideration various factors, including the audit firm's experience and available resources. The ARMC has obtained written assurance from the External Auditors confirming their independence throughout the course of the audit engagement, as per the terms of all relevant professional and regulatory requirements, and was satisfied that the External Auditors have carried out their work independently. The specific procedures for this assessment are outlined in the ARMC's TOR, which is available for reference on the Company's website.

Moreover, the external auditors are granted direct access to the ARMC, enabling them to promptly bring forward any concerns or issues that may arise. The ARMC meets with the external auditors at least once a year, in the absence of Executive Directors and Management. During these meetings, discussions encompass a range of topics, including audit findings, audit plans, and the Company's financial statements.

These reports and associated recommendations are considered and acted upon to maintain or strengthen the internal control environment. The Board maintains the viewpoint that the internal control and risk management systems within the Group are robust and adequate. These systems serve to protect the Group's assets, shareholders' investments, as well as the interests of customers, regulators, employees, and other stakeholders.

The components of the COSO framework encompass Control Environment, Risk Assessment, Control Activities, Information & Communication and Monitoring Activities.

The internal audit activities were carried out based on a risk-based internal audit plan presented by the Internal Auditors to the ARMC for approval. The establishment of the internal audit plan took into consideration the Group's risk profile and input from Management and the ARMC members.

# Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control

# MANAGEMENT'S ASSURANCE

Notwithstanding the fact that the Group's system of risk management and internal controls do not eliminate the possibility of collusion or deliberate circumvention of procedures by employees or fraud or other unforeseen circumstances, the Board has received assurances from the CEO cum Executive Director and the CFO that the Group's risk management and internal control system is operating adequately and effectively in all material aspects, based on the risk management model adopted by the Group. The Management will continue to review and take measures to ensure the ongoing effectiveness and adequacy of the system on risk management and internal controls.

# REVIEW OF THE STATEMENT BY EXTERNAL AUDITORS

As required by Rule 15.23 of the ACE Market Listing Requirements of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad, the external auditors have reviewed this Statement. Their review was performed in accordance with Audit and Assurance Practice Guide 3 ("AAPG 3"), Guidance for Auditors on Engagements to report on the Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control included in the Annual Report, issued by the Malaysian Institute of Accountants. Based on their review, the external auditors have reported to the Board that nothing has come to their attention that causes them to believe that this Statement intended to be included in the annual report is not prepared, in all material respect, in accordance with the disclosures required by paragraphs 41 and 42 of the statement on Risk Management and Internal Internal Control (Guidelines for Directors of Listed Issuers) to be set out, nor is the SORMIC factually inaccurate.

# CONCLUSION

The Directors believe that the system of the internal control is considered appropriate to the current business operations and that the risk taken is at an acceptable level within the context of the business environment of the Group. It should be noted that such arrangements do not eliminate the possibility of collusion or deliberate circumvention of procedures by employees. Human error and/or other unforeseen circumstances can result in poor judgement. For the financial year under review, there were no significant internal control deficiencies or material weaknesses resulting in material losses, contingencies or uncertainties which would require separate disclosure in this Annual Report.

This Statement is made in accordance with the resolution of the Board of Directors dated 24 October 2023.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

TO THE MEMBERS OF SOUTHERN SCORE BUILDERS BERHAD

(INCORPORATED IN MALAYSIA)

REGISTRATION NO: 200301019817 (622237 - D)

# Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements

# Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Southern Score Builders Berhad, which comprise the statements of financial position as at 30 June 2023 of the Group and of the Company, and the statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows of the Group and of the Company for the financial period/year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies, as set out on pages 72 to 117.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and of the Company as at 30 June 2023, and of their financial performance and their cash flows for the financial period/year then ended in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.

# Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Independence and Other Ethical Responsibilities

We are independent of the Group and of the Company in accordance with the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, Conduct and Practice) of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants ("By-Laws") and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) ("IESBA Code"), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the By-Laws and the IESBA Code.

# Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for current financial period/year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Allowance for Expected Credit Losses of Trade Receivables

# The Risk

Refer to Note 8 to the financial statements. We focused on this area because the Group has material amount of trade receivables. The key associated risk was the recoverability of billed trade receivables as management judgement is required in determining the completeness of the allowance for expected credit losses of trade receivables and in assessing its adequacy through considering the expected recoverability of the period-end trade receivables.

# Our Response

We have obtained an understanding of the Group's controls relating to credit control and approval process, how the Group identifies and assesses the allowance for expected credit losses of trade receivables and how the Group makes the accounting estimates for the allowance. We have also reviewed the ageing analysis of the trade receivables and tested the reliability thereof and assessed the recoverability of the overdue trade receivables through examination of cash receipts subsequent to the period end.

# Key Audit Matters (Cont'd)

Revenue Recognition for Construction Contracts

# The Risk

There are significant accounting judgements involved including determining the stage of completion, the timing of revenue recognition and the calculation under the percentage of completion method made by management in applying the Group's revenue recognition policies to construction contracts entered into by the Group. The nature of these judgements resulted in them being susceptible to management bias.

Contract revenue should include the amount agreed in the initial contract, plus revenue from alterations in the original contract work, plus claims and incentive payments that are expected to be collected and that can be measured reliably.

Refer to Note 20 to the financial statements, total revenue from construction contracts was RM97,933,052 which represents  $100\%$  of the Group's revenue in this financial period.

# Our Response

We performed a range of audit procedures which included obtaining samples of contracts or letter of awards, reviewing for change orders or variation orders, reviewing estimated profit and costs to complete and enquiring of key personnel regarding adjustments for job costing and potential contract losses.

We assessed whether the revenue and cost recognition policies are appropriate in accordance with MFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.

There is no key audit matter to be communicated in respect of the audit of the financial statements of the Company.

If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditors' report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.  
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's and of the Company's internal control.  
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors.  
- Conclude on the appropriateness of Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's or the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.  
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.  
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements of the Group. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicated with the Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identified during our audit.

We also provided the Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

From the matters communicated with the Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current financial period/year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# Other Matters

1. This report is made solely to the members of the Company, as a body, in accordance with Section 266 of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility to any other person for the content of this report.  
2. The financial statements of the Group and of the Company as at 30 June 2022 were audited by another firm of Chartered Accountants whose Auditors' report dated 7 October 2022 contained a disclaimer of opinion and material uncertainty related to going concern paragraph.

There have been no significant changes in the nature of these principal activities of the Company and its subsidiary during the financial period/year.

# 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# 2.1 Reverse Acquisition

On 9 July 2021, the Company had entered into a conditional sales of shares agreement with Super Advantage Property Sdn. Bhd. ("SAP") for the acquisition by the Company of 1,000,000 ordinary shares in Southern Score Sdn. Bhd. ("SSSB"), representing the entire equity interest of SSSB held by SAP, for a purchase consideration of RM252,000,000 ("Purchase Consideration"). The Purchase Consideration will be satisfied via the issuance of 1,680,000,000 consideration shares at issue price of RM0.15 per consideration share. Upon completion of the acquisition of SSSB on 9 November 2022, the Company became legal holding company of SSSB.

The former shareholders of SSSB became the majority shareholders of the Company, controlling about  $73.92\%$  of the issued and paid-up share capital of the Company. Further, the Company's continuing operations and key executive management are those of SSSB. Accordingly, the substance of the business combination is that SSSB acquired the Company in a reverse acquisition.

MFRS 3 Business Combinations requires that the consolidated financial statements of the combined entity are issued under the name of the legal holding company, though they are a continuation of the financial statements of the legal subsidiary. In order to comply with MFRS 3, the followings have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements:

(a) the assets and liabilities of the Company and SSSB have been recognised at their book values immediately prior to the reverse acquisition;  
(b) the pre-acquisition retained earnings recognised in the consolidated financial statements are those of SSSB;  
(c) the amount recognised as issued equity instruments in the consolidated financial statements is the sum of:

(i) the issued and paid-up share capital of SSSB immediately before the reverse acquisition; and  
(ii) the cost of achieving the combination.

# BASIS OF PREPARATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT'D)

# 2.1 Reverse Acquisition (cont'd)

MFRS 3 Business Combinations requires that the consolidated financial statements of the combined entity are issued under the name of the legal holding company, though they are a continuation of the financial statements of the legal subsidiary. In order to comply with MFRS 3, the followings have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements (cont'd):

(d) the equity structure appearing these consolidated financial statements (ie. the number and type of equity instruments issued) reflects the equity structure of the Company; and  
(e) the comparative information presented in these consolidated financial statements is that of:

(i) the statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flow relate to the period from 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022 of SSSB and accounting for the results of the Company from the completion date to 31 December 2022; and (ii) the statements of financial position of the enlarged Group as at 31 December 2022.

# 2.2 Statement of Compliance

The financial statements of the Group and the Company have been prepared in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards ("MFRSs"), International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRSs") and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.

# 2.3 Basis of Measurement

The financial statements of the Group and the Company are prepared under the historical cost convention, unless otherwise indicated in the summary of significant accounting policies.

Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability, or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to by the Group and the Company.

The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.

A fair value measurement of a non-financial market takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.

The Group and the Company use valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, recognised the use of relevant observable inputs and recognised the use of unobservable inputs.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are recognised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to their fair value measurement as a whole:

Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  
Level 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to their fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.  
Level 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to their fair value measurement is unobservable.

For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group and the Company determine whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to their fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.

The Group and the Company have established control framework in respect of measurement of fair values of financial instruments.

# 2.6 Significant Accounting Estimates and Judgements

Estimates, assumptions concerning the future and judgements are made in the preparation of the financial statements. They affect the application of the Group's and the Company's accounting policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, and disclosures made. Estimates and underlying assumptions are assessed on an on-going basis and are based on experience and relevant factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The actual results may differ from the judgements, estimates and assumptions made by management, and will seldom equal the estimated results.

# 2.6.1 Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty

Information about significant estimates and assumptions that have the most significant effect on recognition and measurement of assets, liabilities, income and expenses are discussed below.

Useful Lives of Depreciable Assets

The management estimates the useful lives of the property, plant and equipment and to be within 4 to 10 years and reviews the useful lives of depreciable assets at each reporting date. The management assesses that the useful lives represent the expected utility of the assets to the Group and the Company. Actual results, however, may vary due to change in the expected level of usage and technological developments, which may result in an adjustment to the Group's and the Company's assets.

Construction Contracts

The Group recognises contract revenue based on stage of completion method. The stage of completion is measured by reference to the contract costs incurred up to reporting date as a percentage of total estimated cost for each contract. Significant judgement is required in determining the stage of completion, the extent of the contract costs incurred, the estimated total contract costs, the profitability of the contracts, including the foreseeable losses, potential claims (variation orders) to owners of the projects and counter claims from subcontractor and liquidated ascertained damages ("LAD") based on expected completion dates of the contracts.

In making this judgement, the Directors took into consideration the current circumstances and replied on input from the Group's project managers, external consultants, where appropriate and past experience. In addition, in determining the provision for LAD to be recorded, the Directors also assessed the ability of the Group to recover from the subcontractors, the potential LAD imposed on the Group by the project owners for delays in projects caused directly by the subcontractor.

Provision for Expected Credit Losses ("ECLs") of Trade Receivables and Contract Assets

The Group uses a provision matrix to calculate ECLs for trade receivables and contract assets. The provision rates are based on days past due for groupings of various customer segments that have similar loss patterns (i.e., by geography, product type, customer type and rating).

The provision matrix is initially based on the Group's historical observed default rates. The Group will calibrate the matrix to adjust the historical credit loss experience with forward-looking information. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.

The assessment of the correlation between historical observed default rates, forecast economic conditions and ECLs is a significant estimate. The amount of ECLs is sensitive to changes in circumstances and of forecast economic conditions. The Group's historical credit loss experience and forecast of economic conditions may also not be representative of customer's actual default in the future.

# 2.6 Significant Accounting Estimates and Judgements (cont'd)

# 2.6.1 Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty (cont'd)

Impairment of Non-financial Assets

An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's or cash-generating unit's ("CGU") carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. To determine the recoverable amount, management estimates expected future cash flows from each CGU and determines a suitable interest rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. In the process of measuring expected future cash flows, management makes assumptions about future operating results. The actual results may vary, and may cause significant adjustments to the Group's and the Company's assets within the next financial year.

In most cases, determining the applicable discount rate involves estimating the appropriate adjustment to market risk and the appropriate adjustment to asset-specific risk factors.

Income Taxes/Deferred Tax Liabilities

Significant judgement is involved in determining the Group's and the Company's provision for income taxes. There are certain transactions and computations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business.

The Group and the Company recognised tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recognised, such difference will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.

# 2.6.2 Significant Management Judgement

There are no significant areas of management judgement in applying the accounting policies that have any significant effect on the amount recognised in the financial statements.

# 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Group and the Company apply the significant accounting policies, as summarised below, consistently throughout all periods presented in the financial statements, unless otherwise stated.

# 3.1 Consolidation

# 3.1.1 Subsidiary

Subsidiary is entity, including structured entity, controlled by the Group or the Company. Control exists when the Group or the Company is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Potential voting rights are considered when assessing control only when such rights are substantive. Besides, the Group or the Company considers it has de facto power over an investee when, despite not having the majority of voting rights, it has the current ability to direct the activities of the investee that significantly affect the investee's return.

Investment in a subsidiary is stated at cost less any impairment losses in the Company's statement of financial position, unless the investment is held for sale or distribution. The cost of investments includes transaction costs. Where an indication of impairment exists, the carrying amount of the subsidiary is assessed and written down immediately to their recoverable amount.

Upon the disposal of investment in a subsidiary, the difference between the net disposal proceeds and its carrying amount is recognised in profit or loss.

# Notes to the Financial Statements

- 30 June 2023

# SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)

# 3.1 Consolidation (cont'd)

# 3.1.2 Basis of Consolidation

The Group's financial statements consolidate the audited financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary, which have been prepared in accordance with the Group's accounting policies. Amounts reported in the financial statements of subsidiary have been adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the Group. The financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary are all drawn up to the same reporting date.

All intra-group balances, income and expenses resulting from intra-group transactions are eliminated in full.

Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are no longer consolidated from the date that control ceases.

Changes in the Company's ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. In such circumstances, the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the parent.

# 3.1.3 Reverse Acquisition upon Consolidation

Consolidated financial statements prepared following a reverse acquisition are issued under the name of the legal parent (accounting acquiree) but described in the notes as a continuation of the financial statements of the legal subsidiary (accounting acquirer), with one adjustment, which is to adjust retroactively the accounting acquirer's legal capital to reflect the legal capital of the accounting acquiree. That adjustment is required to reflect the capital of the legal parent (the accounting acquiree). Comparative information presented in those consolidated financial statements also is retroactively adjusted to reflect the legal capital of the legal parent (accounting acquiree).

Because the consolidated financial statements represent the continuation of the financial statements of the legal subsidiary except for its capital structure, the consolidated financial statements reflect:

(a) The assets and liabilities of the legal subsidiary (the accounting acquirer) recognised and measured at their pre-combination carrying amounts.  
(b) The assets and liabilities of the legal parent (the accounting acquiree) recognised and measured in accordance with the applicable accounting standard.  
(c) The retained earnings and other equity balances of the legal subsidiary (accounting acquirer) before the business combination.  
(d) The amount recognised as issued equity interests in the consolidated financial statements determined by adding the issued equity interest of the legal subsidiary (the accounting acquirer) outstanding immediately before the business combination to the fair value of the legal parent (accounting acquiree) determined in accordance with the applicable accounting standard. However, the equity structure (i.e. the number and type of equity interests issued) reflects the equity structure of the legal parent, including the equity interests of the legal parent issued to effect the combination. Accordingly, the equity structure of the legal subsidiary is restated using the exchange ratio established in the acquisition agreement to reflect the number of shares of the legal parent issued in the reverse acquisition.

# 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)

# 3.1 Consolidation (cont'd)

# 3.1.4 Loss of Control

Upon the loss of control of a subsidiary, the Group derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any non-controlling interests and the other components of the equity related to the subsidiary. Any surplus or deficit arising on the loss of control is recognised in profit or loss.

If the Group retains any interest in the previous subsidiary, then such interest is measured at fair value at the date that control is lost. Subsequently it is accounted for as an equity accounted investee or as an available-for-sale financial asset depending on the level of influence retained.

# 3.1.5 Eliminations on Consolidation

All intra-group balances, income and expenses and unrealised gains and losses resulting from intra-group transactions are eliminated on consolidation.

# 3.1.6 Investment in an Associate

Associate is entity in which the Group has significant influence, but no control, over its financial and operating policies.

The Group's investment in an associate is accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, investment in an associate is carried in the statements of financial position at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group's share of net assets of the associate since the acquisition date. Goodwill relating to the associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is neither amortised nor individually tested for impairment.

The share of the results of an associate is reflected in profit or loss. Any change in other comprehensive income of those investees is presented as part of the Group's other comprehensive income. In addition, where there has been a change recognised directly in the equity of an associate, the Group recognises its share of any changes and discloses this, when applicable, in the statements of changes in equity. Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate is eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate.

When the Group's share of losses exceeds its interest in an associate, the carrying amount of that interest including any long-term investment is reduced to zero, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the associate.

The financial statements of the associate are prepared as of the same reporting period as the Group. Where necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies of the associate in line with those of the Group.

After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an additional impairment loss on the Group's investment in its associate. The Group determines at each end of the reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If there is such evidence, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value, then recognises the amount in the "share of profit of investments accounted for using the equity method" in profit or loss.

Upon loss of significant influence over the associate, the Group measures and recognises any retained investment at its fair value. Any difference between the carrying amount of the associate upon loss of significant influence and the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in profit or loss.

# SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)

# 3.2 Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.

Subsequent cost is included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the Company and the cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the part of the asset being replaced is derecognised. All other repair and maintenance costs are charged to profit or loss in the period in which they incurred.

Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is computed on the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the various assets. The annual rates of depreciation based on the estimated useful lives of the various classes of depreciable assets are as follows:-

<table><tr><td>Plant and machinery</td><td>20% - 25%</td></tr><tr><td>Air conditioner</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>Computer hardware and software</td><td>20%</td></tr><tr><td>Furniture and fittings</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>Office equipment</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>Renovation</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>Motor vehicles</td><td>20%</td></tr></table>

Where major parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, the cost of the item is allocated on a reasonable basis between the parts and each part is depreciated separately.

At each reporting date, the residual values and useful lives of the property, plant and equipment are reviewed, and the effects of any changes are recognised prospectively as a change in accounting estimate.

Gain or loss arising from the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, and is recognised in profit or loss in the financial period in which the asset is derecognised.

Leased assets (including motor vehicles under lease arrangement) that fulfill the conditions to be recognised as right-of-use assets are presented as right-of-use assets in property, plant and equipment. Refer to accounting policy Note 3.3 to the financial statements on recognition and initial and subsequent measurements of leased assets.

# 3.3 Leases

The Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

# Group as a Lessee

The Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.

# 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)

# 3.3 Leases (cont'd)

Group as a Lessee (cont'd)

Right-of-use Assets

The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the leases (i.e., the date the underlying assets are available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The costs of right-of-use assets include the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the asset, as follows:-

Motor vehicles

20%

If the ownership of the leased assets transfer to the Group at the end of the leases term or the costs reflect the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the assets.

# Lease Liabilities

At the commencement date of the leases, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including insubstance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses (unless they are incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.

In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities are increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities are remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments) or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying assets.

Short-term Leases and Leases of Low-value Assets

The Group and the Company apply the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases that are considered to be low-value. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

# 3.4 Financial Instruments

A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.

# 3.4.1 Financial Assets

Initial Recognition and Measurement

Financial assets are classified, at initial recognition, as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income ("OCI"), and fair value through profit or loss.

The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset's contractual cash flow characteristics and the Group's and the Company's business model for managing them. With the exception of trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group and the Company have applied the practical expedient, the Group and the Company initially measure a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs. Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied the practical expedient are measured at the transaction price.

In order for a financial asset to be classified and measured at amortised cost or fair value through OCI, it needs to give rise to cash flows that are 'solely payments of principal and interest ("SPPI")' on the principal amount outstanding. This assessment is referred to as the SPPI test and is performed at an instrument level. Financial assets with cash flows that are not SPPI are classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss, irrespective of the business model.

The Group's and Company's business model for managing financial assets refers to how it manages its financial assets in order to generate cash flows. The business model determines whether cash flows will result from collecting contractual cash flows, selling the financial assets, or both. Financial assets classified and measured at amortised cost are held within a business model with the objective to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows while financial assets classified and measured at fair value through OCI are held within a business model with objective of both holding to collect contractual cash flows and selling.

Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Group and the Company commit to purchase or sell the asset.

# Subsequent Measurement

For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories:

(a) Financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments);  
(b) Financial assets at fair value through OCI with recycling of cumulative gains and losses (debt instruments);  
(c) Financial assets designated at fair value through OCI with no recycling of cumulative gains and losses upon derecognition (equity instruments); or  
(d) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.

The Group and the Company only have financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVTPL on their statements of financial position.

# 3.4 Financial Instruments (cont'd)

# 3.4.1 Financial Assets (cont'd)

Subsequent Measurement (cont'd)

Financial Assets at Amortised Cost

Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest ("EIR") method and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised, modified or impaired. The Group's and Company's financial assets at amortised cost includes trade and most of the other receivables, amount due from a subsidiary and cash and bank balances.

Financial Assets at FVTPL

Financial assets that are held within a different business model other than 'hold to collect' or 'hold to collect and sell' are categorised at FVTPL. Further, irrespective of business model financial assets whose contractual cash flows are not solely payments of principal and interest are accounted for at FVTPL.

The category also contains an equity investment. The fair value was determined in line with the requirements of MFRS 9, which does not allow for measurement at cost.

Asset in this category is measured at fair value with gains or losses recognised in profit or loss. The fair values of financial assets in this category are determined by reference to active market transactions or using a valuation technique where no active market exists. The Group's and the Company's financial assets at FVTPL include short-term placements.

Derecognition

A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognised when:

(a) The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or  
(b) The Group and the Company have transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a 'pass-through' arrangement; and either (a) the Group and the Company have transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group and the Company have neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

When the Group and the Company have transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a passthrough arrangement, it evaluates if, and to what extent, it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Group and the Company continue to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of its continuing involvement. In that case, the Group and the Company also recognise an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Group and the Company have retained.

Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group and the Company could be required to repay.

# SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)

# 3.4 Financial Instruments (cont'd)

# 3.4.1 Financial Assets (cont'd)

Impairment

The Group and the Company recognise an allowance for ECLs for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group and the Company expect to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms.

ECLs are recognised in two stages. For credit exposures for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the next 12-months (a 12-month ECLs). For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is required for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default (a lifetime ECLs).

Impairment for Trade Receivables and Contract Assets

For trade receivables and contract assets, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment.

To measure ECLs, trade receivables and contract assets are grouped into categories. The categories are differentiated by the different business risks and are subject to different credit assessments. Contract assets relate to unbilled work in progress and have substantially the same risk characteristics as the trade receivables for the same types of contracts. The Group considers the expected credit loss rates for trade receivables as a reasonable approximation of the loss rates for contract assets with similar risk characteristics.

Impairment for Financial Assets other than Trade Receivables and Contract Assets

The Group and the Company consider the probability of default upon initial recognition of the asset and whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis throughout each reporting period. To assess whether there is a significant increase in credit risk, the Group and the Company compare the risk of a default occurring on the asset as at the reporting date with the risk of default as at the date of initial recognition. The assessment considers available, reasonable and supportable forward-looking information.

Credit Impaired

A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows. The Group and the Company consider a receivable as credit impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated cash flows have occurred. These instances include adverse changes in the financial capability of the debtor and default or significant delay in payments. However, in certain cases, the Group and the Company may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal or external information indicates that the Group and the Company are unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group and the Company.

# 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)

# 3.4 Financial Instruments (cont'd)

# 3.4.2 Financial Liabilities

Initial Recognition and Measurement

Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.

All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.

# Subsequent Measurement

For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial liabilities are classified in two categories:

(a) Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss; or  
(b) Financial liabilities at amortised cost.

The Group and the Company only have financial liabilities at amortised cost on their statements of financial position.

# Financial Liabilities at Amortised Cost

After initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the profit or loss.

The Group's and Company's financial liabilities include trade and other payables, amount due to a Director and borrowing which are measured at amortised cost.

# Derecognition

A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the profit or loss.

# 3.4.3 Offsetting of Financial Instruments

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statements of financial position if, and only if, there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

A financial guarantee contract is a contract that requires the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts are recognised in the statements of financial position, initially as a liability at fair value, net of transaction costs.

Financial guarantee contracts are subsequently measured at the higher of.

(a) The amount determined in accordance with the ECL model under MFRS 9 Financial Instruments; and  
(b) The amount initially recognised, less, when appropriate, the cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the principles of MFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.

# 3.5 Impairment of Non-financial Assets

The Group and the Company assess at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group and the Company estimate the asset's recoverable amount. An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's or CGU's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.

In determining fair value less costs to sell, recent market transactions are taken into account, if available. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded subsidiary or other available fair value indicators.

The Group and the Company base their impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations which are prepared separately for each of the Group's and the Company's CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations are generally covering a period of five years. For longer periods, a long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the third year.

Impairment losses are recognised in the profit or loss in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset, except for a property previously revalued where the revaluation was taken to other comprehensive income. In this case, the impairment is also recognised in other comprehensive income up to the amount of any previous revaluation.

For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group and the Company estimate the asset's or CGU's recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the profit or loss unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.

# 3.6 Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, bank balances, deposits with licensed bank, short-term placements and bank overdraft which are readily available to known amount of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

Bank overdraft is shown in current liabilities in the statements of financial position.

For the purpose of the statements of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents are presented net of pledged deposits and bank overdraft.

# 3.7 Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities

A contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the customer. If the Group and the Company perform by transferring goods or services to a customer before the customer pays consideration or before payment is due, a contract asset is recognised for the earned consideration that is conditional.

A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Group has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. If a customer pays consideration before the Group transfers goods or services to the customer, a contract liability is recognised when the payment is made or the payment is due (whichever is earlier). Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the Group performs under the contract.

Refer to accounting policy Note 3.4.1 to the financial statements on impairment on contract assets.

# 3.8 Revenue Recognition

Revenue arises mainly from the construction contracts. To determine whether to recognise revenue, the Group and the Company follow a 5-step process:

1. Identifying the contract with a customer;  
2. Identifying the performance obligations;  
3. Determining the transaction price;  
4. Allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations; and  
5. Recognising revenue when/as performance obligation(s) are satisfied.

Transaction price for a contract is allocated amongst the various performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices. The transaction price for a contract excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties.

The control of the promised goods or services may be transferred over time or at a point in time. Revenue for performance obligation that is not satisfied over time is recognised at the point in time at which the customer obtains control of the promised goods or services. The control over the goods or services is transferred over time and revenue is recognised over time if:

The customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group's and the Company's performance as the Group and the Company perform;  
The Group's and the Company's performance create or enhance an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced; or  
The Group's and the Company's performance do not create an asset with an alternative use and the Group and the Company have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.

# 3.8 Revenue Recognition (cont'd)

# 3.8.1 Revenue from Construction Contracts

The revenue from construction contracts is measured at the fixed transaction price agreed under the respective agreements with the project owners, net of expected LAD payment, based on the expected value method.

Revenue from construction contract is recognised as and when the control of the asset is transferred to the customer and it is probable that the Group will collect the consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for the asset that will be transferred to the customer. Control of the asset is transferred over time if the Group's performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group. The Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to-date. The Group recognises revenue over the period of the contract by reference to the progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation.

The Group recognises revenue over time using the input method, which is based on the contract costs incurred up to the end of the reporting period as a percentage of total estimated costs for each contract. Costs incurred in the financial period in connection with future activity on a contract are excluded from the contract costs in determining the stage of completion. Such costs are presented as contract assets. Refer to accounting policy Note 3.7 to the financial statements on contract assets and contract liabilities.

# 3.8.2 Dividend Income

Dividend is recognised when the Company's right to receive payment is established, which is generally when shareholders approve the dividend.

# 3.8.3 Interest Income

Interest income is recognised in the profit or loss on time proportion basis taking into account the principal outstanding and the effective rate over the period to maturity, when it is determined that such income will accrue to the Group and the Company.

# 3.9 Tax Expense

Tax expense comprises current tax and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income.

# 3.9.1 Current Tax

Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Current tax is recognised in the statements of financial position as a liability (or an asset) to the extent that it is unpaid (or refundable).

# 3.9.2 Deferred Tax

Deferred tax is recognised using the liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the statements of financial position and their tax bases. Deferred tax is not recognised for the temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting date.

The amount of deferred tax recognised is measured based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

# 3.9 Tax Expense (cont'd)

# 3.9.2 Deferred Tax (cont'd)

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

# 3.10 Employee Benefits Expense

Short-term Employee Benefits

Wages, salaries, bonuses and social security contributions are recognised as expenses in the financial period in which associated services are rendered by employees of the Group and the Company. Short-term accumulating compensated absences such as paid annual leave are recognised when services are rendered by employees which increase their entitlement to future compensated absences, and short term non-accumulating compensated absences such as sick leave are recognised when the absences occurred.

Defined Contribution Plan

The Group and the Company are required by law to make monthly contributions to the Employees Provident Fund, a statutory defined contribution plan for all their eligible employees, based on certain prescribed rates of the employees' salaries. Once the contributions have been paid, the Group and the Company have no further payment obligations. The contributions are recognised as expenses as and when incurred.

# 3.11 Equity, Reserves and Distribution to Owners

An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities. Ordinary shares are equity instruments.

Retained earnings/(Accumulated losses) include all current and prior financial years' retained profits/ (accumulated losses).

Interim dividends are simultaneously proposed and declared, because the articles of association of the Company grant the Directors the authority to declare interim dividends.

Consequently, interim dividends are recognised directly as a liability when they are proposed and declared.

Final dividends proposed by the Directors are not accounted for in shareholders' equity as an appropriation of retained earnings, until they have been approved by the shareholders in a general meeting. When these dividends have been approved by the shareholders and declared, they are recognised as a liability.

The distribution of non-cash assets to owners is recognised as a dividend payable when the dividend was approved by shareholders. The dividend payable is measured at the fair value of the shares to be distributed. At the end of the financial period, the Company reviews the carrying amount of the dividend payable, with any changes in the fair value of the dividend payable are recognised in equity. When the Company settles the dividend payable, the difference between the carrying amount of the dividend distributed and the carrying amount of the dividend payable is recognised as a separate line item in profit or loss.

All transactions with owners of the Company are recorded separately within equity.

# 3.12 Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group and the Company have a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the Group and the Company expect some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to a provision is presented in the statements of profit or loss net of any reimbursement.

If the effect of the time of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.

# 3.13 Borrowing Costs

Borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.

# 3.14 Contingencies

# 3.14.1 Contingent Liabilities

Where it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required, or the amount cannot be estimated reliably, the obligation is not recognised in the statements of financial position and is disclosed as a contingent liability, unless the probability of outflow of economic benefits is remote. Possible obligations, whose existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more future events, are also disclosed as contingent liabilities unless the probability of outflow of economic benefits is remote.

# 3.14.2 Contingent Assets

When an inflow of economic benefit of an asset is probable where it arises from past events and where existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity, the asset is not recognised in the statements of financial position but is being disclosed as a contingent asset. When the inflow of economic benefit is virtually certain, then the related asset is recognised.

# 3.15 Related Parties

A related party is a person or entity that is related to the Group. A related party transaction is a transfer of resources, services or obligations between the Group and its related party, regardless of whether a price is charged.

(a) A person or a close member of that person's family is related to the Group if that person:-

(i) Has control or joint control over the Group;  
(ii) Has significant influence over the Group; or  
(iii) Is a member of the key management personnel of the Group.

# 3.16 Earnings per Ordinary Share

The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share ("EPS") data for its ordinary shares.

Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial period.

Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company over the weighted average number of shares outstanding, for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares during the financial period.

# 3.17 Operating Segments

An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenue and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group's other components. All operating segments' operating results are reviewed regularly by the chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.

# Financial Risk Management

The Group and the Company are exposed to financial risks arising from their operations and the use of financial instruments. Financial risk management policies are established to ensure that adequate resources are available for the development of the Group's and of the Company's business whilst managing its credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk. The Group and the Company operate within clearly defined policies and procedures that are approved by the Board of Directors to ensure the effectiveness of the risk management process.

The main areas of financial risks faced by the Group and the Company and the policies of the Group and of the Company in respect of the major areas of treasury activities are set out as follows:-

# (a) Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk of a financial loss to the Group and to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. It is the Group's and the Company's policy to enter into financial instrument with a diversity of creditworthy counterparties. The Group and the Company do not expect to incur material credit losses of its financial assets or other financial instruments.

Concentration of credit risk exists when changes in economic, industry and geographical factors similarly affect the group of counterparties whose aggregate credit exposure is significant in relation to the Group's and to the Company's total credit exposure. The Group's and the Company's transactions are entered into with diverse creditworthy counterparties, thereby mitigate any significant concentration of credit risk.

It is the Group's and the Company's policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. The Group and the Company do not offer credit terms without the approval of the management.

# (a) Credit Risk (cont'd)

The areas where the Group and the Company are exposed to credit risk are as follows:-

Receivables and Contract Assets

The net carrying amount of receivables is considered a reasonable approximate of fair value.

With a credit policy in place to ensure the credit risk is monitored on an on-going basis, the management has taken reasonable steps to ensure that receivables that are neither past due nor impaired are stated at their realisable values. A significant portion of the receivables are regular customers that have been transacting with the Group. The Group uses ageing analysis to monitor the credit quality of the receivables. Any receivables having significant balances past due more than credit terms granted are deemed to have higher credit risk, and are monitored individually.

Trade receivables that are neither past due nor impaired are creditworthy debtors with good payment records with the Group. None of the Group's trade receivables that are neither past due nor impaired have been renegotiated during the financial period.

Trade receivables of RM9,899,699 (31.12.2022: RM18,557,000) was past due but not impaired. The Directors are of the opinion that the receivables are collectible in view of long-term business relationship with the customers and no recent history of default.

An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date using a provision matrix to measure expected credit losses. The provision rates are based on overall past trend payments of the customers, financial performance of each individual customer and base lending rate and gross domestic product rate. All of these customers have low risk of default. The calculation reflects the probability-weighted outcome, the time value of money and reasonable and supportable information that is available at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.

None of the Group's financial assets are secured by collateral or other credit enhancement.

Set out below is the information about the credit risk exposure and ECLs on the Group's trade receivables and contract assets which are grouped together as they are expected to have similar risk nature:-

# (a) Credit Risk (cont'd)

The areas where the Group and the Company are exposed to credit risk are as follows (cont'd):

Receivables and Contract Assets (cont'd)

In respect of trade receivables and contract assets, the Group is subject to significant credit risk exposure to a single counterparty or a group of counterparties having similar characteristics, as disclosed below:-

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">30.6.2023</td><td colspan="2">31.12.2022</td></tr><tr><td>RM</td><td>%</td><td>RM</td><td>%</td></tr><tr><td>Trade receivables</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Top 2 customers(31.12.2022: Top 3 customers)</td><td>48,172,797</td><td>54</td><td>55,873,038</td><td>65</td></tr><tr><td>Contract assets</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Top 2 customers(31.12.2022: Top 3 customers)</td><td>20,306,839</td><td>79</td><td>17,827,733</td><td>76</td></tr></table>

# Other Receivables

The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by their carrying amounts in the statements of financial position.

# Corporate Guarantees

The maximum exposure to credit risk of the Group and the Company amounting to RM7,692,256 (31.12.2022: Nil) and RM12,806,291 (30.6.2022: Nil) respectively represented the outstanding banking facilities of third parties and its subsidiary as at the end of the reporting period.

The Group and the Company provide unsecured financial guarantee to bank in respect of banking facilities granted to third parties and its subsidiary. The Group and the Company monitor on an ongoing basis the results of the third parties and the subsidiary and repayments made by the third parties and the subsidiary. As at the end of reporting period, there was no indication that the third parties and the subsidiary would default on repayment.

The corporate guarantees do not have a determinable effect on the term of the credit facilities due to the bank requiring the Group and the Company's guarantees as a pre-condition for approving the banking facilities granted to the third parties and subsidiary. The actual terms of the credit facilities are likely to be the best indicator of "at market" term and hence the fair value of the credit facilities are equal to the credit facilities amount received by the third party and subsidiary. As such, there is no value on the corporate guarantees to be recognised in the financial statements.

# Intercompany Balances

The Company provides unsecured advances to its subsidiary and monitors the results of the subsidiary regularly.

As at the end of the reporting date, there was no indication that the carrying amount of amount due from the subsidiary are not recoverable.

# Cash and Cash Equivalents

The credit risk for cash and cash equivalents is considered negligible, since the counterparties are reputable banks with high quality external credit ratings and have no history of default. Consequently, the Company is of the view that the allowance is not material and hence, it is not provided for.

# Financial Risk Management (cont'd)

The main areas of financial risks faced by the Group and the Company and the policies of the Group and of the Company in respect of the major areas of treasury activities are set out as follows (cont'd):

# (b) Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group and the Company will not be able to meet their financial obligations as and when they fall due as a result of shortage of funds.

In managing its exposures to liquidity risk arises principally from its various payables, lease liabilities and borrowing, the Group and the Company maintain a level of cash and cash equivalents deemed adequate by the management to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities as and when they fall due.

The Group and the Company aim at maintaining a balance of sufficient cash and deposits and flexibility in funding by keeping diverse sources of committed and uncommitted credit facilities from various banks.

The summary of the maturity profile based on contractual undiscounted repayment obligations of non-derivative financial liabilities are as follows:-

# FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONT'D)

# Financial Risk Management (cont'd)

The main areas of financial risks faced by the Group and the Company and the policies of the Group and of the Company in respect of the major areas of treasury activities are set out as follows (cont'd):

# (c) Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of the Group's and of the Company's financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.

The Group's and the Company's variable rate borrowing are exposed to a risk of change in cash flows due to changes in interest rates. Short term receivables and payables are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk.

The Group's and the Company's interest rate management objective is to manage the interest expenses consistent with maintaining an acceptable level of exposure to interest rate fluctuation. In order to achieve this objective, the Group and the Company target a mix of fixed and floating debt based on assessment of its existing exposure and desired interest rate profile.

The interest rate profile of the Group's and the Company's significant interest-bearing financial instruments, based on carrying amounts as at the end of the reporting period are as below:-

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">Group</td><td colspan="2">Company</td></tr><tr><td>30.6.2023RM</td><td>31.12.2022RM</td><td>30.6.2023RM</td><td>30.6.2022RM</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed rate instruments</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Financial asset</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Deposits with licensed banks</td><td>7,718,132</td><td>-</td><td>7,718,132</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Financial liability</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Lease liabilities</td><td>(417,448)</td><td>(126,347)</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Net financial asset/(liability)</td><td>7,300,684</td><td>(126,347)</td><td>7,718,132</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Floating rate instruments</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Financial asset</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Amount due from a subsidiary</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>27,537,962</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Financial liability</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Borrowing</td><td>(4,995,142)</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Net financial (liability)/asset</td><td>(4,995,142)</td><td>-</td><td>27,537,962</td><td>-</td></tr></table>

# Fair Value Sensitivity Analysis for Fixed Rate Instruments

The Group and the Company do not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, and the Group and the Company do not designate derivatives as hedging instruments under a fair value hedge accounting model. Therefore, a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect profit or loss.

Cash Flow Sensitivity Analysis for Floating Rate Instrument

The following table illustrates the sensitivity of profit to a reasonably possible change in interest rate of  $+/-25$  (31.12.2022: Nil) basis points ("bp"). These changes are considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions. The calculations are based on a change in the average market interest rate for each reporting date, and the financial instruments held at each reporting date that are sensitive to change in interest rates. All other variables are held constant.

# Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Group and the Company have established policies and procedures in respect of the fair value measurement.

Financial Assets that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

Certain financial assets of the Group and the Company are measured at fair value at the end of the reporting period/ year. Details of fair value measurement of those financial assets are as follows:-

<table><tr><td></td><td colspan="2">Fair value</td><td>Fair value hierarchy</td><td>Valuation method and key inputs</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>30.6.2023</td><td>31.12.2022</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>RM</td><td>RM</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Group Financial asset</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Short-term placements</td><td>71,121,317</td><td>80,340,769</td><td>Level 1</td><td>Net asset value provided by fund manager - Quoted prices in active market.</td></tr><tr><td>Company Financial asset</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Short-term placements</td><td>71,121,317</td><td>-</td><td>Level 1</td><td>Net asset value provided by fund manager - Quoted prices in active market.</td></tr></table>

There is no transfer between the fair value hierarchy during the financial period/year.

The carrying amount of financial asset of the Group and of the Company at the reporting date approximate its fair value due to its short-term in nature or immaterial discounting impact.

# 2. Resolution 1 & 2 - Re-election of Directors pursuant to Clause 118 of the Company's Constitution

In determining the eligibility of the Directors standing for re-election at the forthcoming  $20^{\text{th}}$  AGM, the Nomination and Remuneration ("NRC") had reviewed the following assessments of each of the retiring Directors:

i) Assessment on the performance of directors and effectiveness of the Board as a whole;  
ii) Assessment on the performance of the members of the Board Committees;  
iii) Assessment on the independence of the Independent Directors;  
iv) Assessment on the fit and proper of the directors in line with the Directors' Fit and Proper Policy of the Company; and  
v) Assessment on the tenure of service of the Independent Directors and composition of the Board.

The NRC was satisfied with the performance of the retiring Directors in discharging their duties and responsibilities professionally and objectively in the best interest of the Company and shareholders. The retiring Directors have met the criteria of character, integrity, experience, competence and time commitment in discharging their roles in line with the Directors' Fit and Proper Policy of the Company. All the Independent Directors have complied with the independence criteria as set by the Bursa Malaysia and confirmed that they are able to exercise independent judgement under all circumstance.

Based on the above, the Board endorsed the NRC's recommendation on re-election of the retiring directors.

The details and profile of the Directors who is standing for re-election at the  $20^{\text{th}}$  AGM is provided in the Board of Directors section on page 8, 9 and 12 of the Company's Annual Report 2023.

The Directors' fees will be pro-rated to their term of office as Director and may include fees payable to such additional Director(s) appointed before the next Annual General Meeting of the Company.

As an illustration, the fee payable to the Directors pursuant to this resolution is as follows:

<table><tr><td>Name of Director</td><td>Amount per month (RM)</td><td>Amount per annum (RM)</td></tr><tr><td>Dato&#x27; Haji Mohd Amran Bin Wahid</td><td>6,000</td><td>72,000</td></tr><tr><td>Chai Tham Poh</td><td>6,000</td><td>72,000</td></tr><tr><td>Phe Kheng Peng</td><td>6,000</td><td>72,000</td></tr><tr><td>Too Siew Mooi</td><td>6,000</td><td>72,000</td></tr><tr><td>Additional Director that may be appointed</td><td>6,000</td><td>Pro-rated to their term of office</td></tr></table>

# 4. Resolution 4 - Re-appointment of Grant Thornton Malaysia PLT

# 5. Resolution 5 - Mandate to issue shares pursuant to Sections 75 and 76 of the Companies Act 2016

The Directors did not issue any new shares pursuant to the existing Mandate which will lapse at the conclusion of the  $20^{\text{th}}$  AGM. The proposed adoption of Resolution 5 is for the purpose of waiving the statutory pre-emptive rights of shareholders of the Company ("Waiver of Pre-Emptive Rights") and granting a renewed general mandate ("General Mandate") and empowering the Directors of the Company, pursuant to the Act, to issue and allot new shares in the Company from time to time provided that the aggregate number of shares issued pursuant to the General Mandate does not exceed  $10\%$  of the total number of issued shares of the Company for the time being. The General Mandate, unless revoked or varied by the Company in general meeting, will expire at the conclusion of the next AGM of the Company.

The Waiver of Pre-emptive Rights will allow the Directors of the Company to issue new shares of the Company which rank equally to existing issued shares of the Company, to any person without having to offer the new shares to all existing shareholders of the Company prior to issuance of new shares in the Company under the General Mandate. The General Mandate will provide flexibility to the Company for allotment of shares for any possible fundraising activities, including but not limited to placement of shares for the purpose of funding future investment project(s), working capital and/or acquisition(s).

# 6. Resolution 6 - Proposed Renewal of Existing Shareholders' Mandate for Recurrent Related Party Transactions of a Revenue or Trading Nature

The proposed resolution, if passed, will allow the Group to renew its mandate to enter into Recurrent Related Party Transactions of a revenue or trading nature pursuant to the provisions of ACE Market Listing Requirements of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad.
