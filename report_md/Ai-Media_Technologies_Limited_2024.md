# Chair's letter

# Dear fellow Shareholders,

As I reflect on the past three years, I am proud of the accomplishments achieved by our Company. Since we acquired New York-based EEG in May 2021, we have successfully transitioned our legacy human services business to offer a suite of AI-powered technology solutions to a diverse range of customers globally. This shift has enabled us to broaden our customer base, expanding into new segments and territories, and transition to more recurring, higher-margin revenue while increasing service quality and customer satisfaction.

From FY22 to FY24 we increased our technology revenue at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of  $35\%$ , and we significantly improved our gross profit margins from  $55\%$  to  $64\%$ . In FY24, approximately  $50\%$  of our revenue is derived from technology sales, reflecting our ability to build a scalable business model while delivering sustainable growth. In FY24, total revenue grew  $7\%$  to  $66.2$  million, and we saw a  $24\%$  increase on FY23 to Earnings Before Interest Tax and Depreciation (EBITDA) to  $\$4.1$  million. As we continue to drive adoption of our technology products, we remain committed to growing technology revenues and are targeting this segment to account for greater than  $80\%$  of total revenue within the next 18 months.

The growth in technology sales in FY24 was driven by the successful launch of LEXI 3.0 in May 2023. LEXI 3.0 is a new and improved version of our flagship live automatic captioning solution that takes advantage of the latest innovations in AI.

LEXI 3.0 delivers results that rival human captions at a fraction of the cost. It is capable of live captioning a wide range of content types from linear TV broadcasts, Over-the-Top (OTT), live sports, government and court proceedings, meetings, events and more. Captions are delivered through our encoders (hardware or virtual) and connected to our iCap Cloud Network. This integrated end-to-end solution fits into our customers' workflows, providing superior service for them and a competitive moat for us.

During FY24, we were pleased to grow and diversify our revenue mix and customer base to include sports-rights holders, local, state and federal governments and an increasing number of large enterprises and universities. To continue growing our technology sales and our iCap Cloud Network, we enhanced our global presence by expanding our sales team and increasing our attendance at key industry tradeshow, and we established new strategic distribution partnerships. These initiatives resulted in major new contract wins and renewals in FY24 and building out our sales pipeline for FY25.

To drive future growth, we continued to invest in the Company's ongoing Research and Development (R&D) initiatives and leveraged new LEXI product releases, including LEXI Disaster Recovery (DR) and LEXI Recorded, adding to our LEXI solutions suite and leading to additional cross-selling opportunities. By continuously incorporating the latest advancements in AI, we continue to offer market leading solutions, further strengthening and extending our defensive moat.

The triumphs over the course of the year would not have been possible without the dedication of the broader Al-Media team led by CEO and Co-Founder Tony Abrahams. I would like to express my gratitude for being nominated as Chair of the Company and recognise Deanne Weir for her stewardship in the Chair role over the past ten years. I have appreciated working alongside Deanne on the Board and on behalf of all Directors and staff, thank her for her valuable contribution and dedication over the years. Her efforts have been instrumental to our success. I would also like to thank my fellow Board members Cheryl Hayman and Alison Loat for their continuous efforts in driving the Company to success.

As we move into the new financial year, I am pleased to announce the appointment of Brent Cubis as Independent, Non-Executive Director as of 1 July 2024. Brent is a highly experienced Non-Executive Director and CFO with over 30 years of board level experience in senior finance roles for global businesses in health, medical devices, media, property and tourism; we look forward to his contribution as we execute on our growth priorities.

As we look forward into FY25, we are well positioned to continue our growth trajectory. We remain focused on deepening our engagement with existing customers, continuously improving our solutions via our ongoing R&D investment initiatives and investing in sales and marketing activities to acquire new customers across new territories and market segments.

# 24%

Increase in FY24 EBITDA

As we continue to deliver sustainable growth, we are confident in our ability to keep increasing our technology revenue, further improving gross profit margins, to deliver a valuation uplift and enhance shareholder value.

On behalf of the Board, I would like to express our gratitude to our dedicated employees for their hard work and our shareholders for their ongoing support. Together, we will continue to execute on our transformation and position Al-Media for substantial growth. I look forward to updating you with recent wins and milestones at our Annual General Meeting to be held in November 2024.

Thank you,

# Dear fellow Shareholders,

FY24 was a pivotal year in which Al-Media successfully transitioned the majority of its key customers in our core Live Captioning market from human Services to technology products and began to extend the AI-driven LEXI Toolkit beyond live captioning to the much larger language services market.

Technology revenues accounted for half of the Company's total revenue at a gross margin of  $85\%$ , mainly driven by the uptake of LEXI solutions. With over  $80\%$  of FY24 revenue derived from Live Captioning products, the transformational performance of LEXI has accelerated the uptake of a technology-only solution by an increasing number of customers, including broadcasters.

# CEO's letter

The value proposition for LEXI is clear: LEXI offers superior quality, latency, security and resilience over traditional live human captioning - at a fraction of the cost.

# LEXI TOOLKIT UPDATE

Al-Media's value proposition is to embed the best AI language products within our customers' existing workflows. For the first time in FY24, the quality of our AI captioning product LEXI overtook the significantly more expensive legacy 'human-in-the-loop' Live Captioning workflows. This monumental milestone was achieved in Live Captioning first, and over the next few years we anticipate LEXI superseding humans in other products serviced by our LEXI Toolkit.

In Q4 FY24 AI-Media launched innovative product LEXI DR (Disaster Recovery), an on-premise device providing failover for cloud and connectivity issues. During the quarter, the Company sold 13 LEXI DR devices and 66 licenses to four different customers. LEXI DR is the final module required to remove the traditional requirement for humans as a backup or failover workflow, therefore as we continue to sell devices, human services revenue will continue to decline.

LEXI Recorded was also launched in FY24, offering fast and secure AI-driven captioning of media clips. The quality of LEXI Recorded already exceeds that of LEXI Live and has generated great interest from early adopters. With 100 times more recorded content than live content produced, the total addressable market for LEXI Recorded is considerably larger than the market for LEXI Live. Continuing to improve the quality and features of LEXI Recorded is a key product development priority for the Company.

As we step into FY25, AI-Media will continue to invest in our R&D initiatives and several product releases are scheduled throughout the financial year, including an upgrade to LEXI Translate and LEXI Library, and the first launch of AI-Media's LEXI Voice products, LEXI Audio Description, LEXI Voice and LEXI Dub.

# OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS

AI-Media earns technology revenue from new encoder sales when a) a new customer is won; b) an existing customer replaces an old encoder; and c) when an existing customer adds additional encoders. In FY24, AI-Media sold over 800 hardware encoders to 50 new customers, and it was the Company's most successful year in terms of up-selling additional encoders to existing customers.

Revenue from encoding hardware grew  $40 \%$ year- on- year to  $12.8$ million in FY24, compared to  $\$ 9.1$ million in FY23. As we look to extend our market leading position from live closed captioning into other AI- powered language services, our ability to persist with increased encoder penetration will create exciting opportunities for revenue growth.

AI-Media successfully implemented the monetisation of our iCap network for third-party captioning agencies, previously supplied at no cost by EEG. Over the last three years, the iCap network usage grew at a CAGR of  $18\%$  and is estimated to contribute to over $1.6 million per annum. This will fund further improvements in the resilience of the network from 99.80% in 2021 at the date of EEG acquisition to a target of 99.999% in FY25 (Five Nines).

Between FY21 and FY24, the usage of LEXI products grew at a CAGR of  $76\%$ . This exceptional growth underscores the increasing effectiveness and demand for our technology solutions, specifically with improved accuracy and automation features.

# FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

In FY24 technology represented  $66 \%$ of our gross profit, with gross margin expansion reaching  $64 \%$ in FY24, up from  $60 \%$ in the prior corresponding year (pcp). EBITDA has also increased by over  $24 \%$ , reaching $4.1 million, reflecting improved performance and growing technology revenue, while still allowing for growth investments in sales, product and engineering teams.

Our successful transition away from legacy human Services has seen a reduction in operational expenditure for that product line. A large investment has been made during the year to grow our sales team, up by  $13\%$  on FY23. As we aim to penetrate new regions specifically in the Americas and EMEA as well as target growth in the enterprise and government segments, we will continue to invest in additional sales resources, trade show attendance, and product development, permitting us to remain at the forefront of the market in terms of innovation and to further advance our defensive moat.

We achieved operating cash flow of  $3.6 million signalling sustained performance and scalable growth potential within our technology business. Our inventories increased from a very low$ 0.9 million in FY23 to $2.4 million in FY24 as a direct result of a strategic decision to keep additional stock to meet latent customer demand.

During the first half of the financial year, we paid the final instalment of  $8.1 million related to the acquisition of EEG and ACS. While this reduced our cash position, we remain well positioned to execute on future growth objectives with a solid cash balance of$ 10.9 million.

# STRATEGY & OUTLOOK

Looking ahead, Al-Media will continue to focus on expanding into new segments and territories and growing technology revenues at higher margins to improve the Company's overall profitability. Our future growth plans draw on three key strategic goals:

1. Global expansion: harness our leadership position in North America and Australia to extend to EMEA, APAC and Latin America.

2. Expand beyond broadcast: AI-driven language services have innate demand in Government, Enterprise and Education sectors. Al-Media's focus in coming years is to increase the percentage of revenue generated by sectors outside of broadcast.

3. Drive adoption of new AI-powered LEXI products: Live Captioning represents less than  $1 \%$ of the total addressable market by our LEXI Toolkit yet currently comprises  $80 \%$ of FY24 revenues. Continuing to expand the LEXI Toolkit and grow sales outside of Live Captioning is our third growth goal.

Our continued growth in building a vertically integrated ecosystem of customer workflows has been the cornerstone to our success and our accomplishments this year have set a strong foundation for continued growth. We remain committed to innovating and enhancing our technology solutions to capture a greater share of the language services market.

Our success and achievements to date would not have been possible without the dedicated Al-Media team, the wisdom of the Board, and the continued support of our customers. Thank you to our shareholders for your continued support and I look forward to updating you as we advance towards our strategic goals and capitalise on emerging opportunities.

# Directors' report

The directors present their report, together with the financial statements, on the consolidated entity (referred to hereafter as the 'Group') consisting of Ai-Media Technologies Limited (referred to hereafter as the 'Company' or 'parent entity') and the entities it controlled at the end of, or during, the year ended 30 June 2024.

# Directors

The following persons were directors of Ai-Media Technologies Limited during the whole of the financial year and up to the date of this report, unless otherwise stated:

John Martin - Non-Executive Director and Chair (appointed as Chair on 29 February 2024)

Anthony Abrahams - Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer

Alison Loat - Non-Executive Director

Cheryl Hayman - Non-Executive Director

Brent Cubis - Non-Executive Director (appointed on 1 July 2024)

Deanne Weir - Non-Executive Director and Chair (retired on 29 February 2024)

# Principal activities

Ai-Media Technologies Limited (Ai-Media or Company) (ASX: AIM), is a global provider of technology-driven captioning, transcription and translation products and services.

# Dividends

There were no dividends paid, recommended or declared during the current or previous financial year.

# Review of operations

The loss for the Group after providing for income tax amounted to  $1,340,996 (30 June 2023:$ 4,017,064).

# Operations

A summary of the results for the year is as follows:

<table><tr><td></td><td>2024
$</td><td>2023
$</td><td>Change
$</td><td>Change
%</td></tr><tr><td>Revenue from operating activities</td><td>66,236,058</td><td>61,769,967</td><td>4,466,091</td><td>7.2%</td></tr><tr><td>Earnings/(loss) before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA)</td><td>4,111,855</td><td>3,310,552</td><td>801,303</td><td>24.2%</td></tr><tr><td>Loss after tax (expense)/benefit from ordinary activities</td><td>(1,340,996)</td><td>(4,017,064)</td><td>2,676,068</td><td>(66.6%)</td></tr></table>

EBITDA is a financial measure which is not prescribed by the Australian Accounting Standards (AASBs) and represents the profit under AASBs adjusted for specific items. The directors consider EBITDA to be one of the key financial measures of the Group.

The strong growth in technology sales and the ongoing transition from human based services has led to material EBITDA growth. The improved accuracy of LEXI, the Group's automated captioning solution, has seen the successful transition of existing customers and the acquisition of new customers. This is particularly evident in the Broadcast sector where the adoption of LEXI for live captioning has accelerated. The Group continues to grow its market share in this broadly defined area and anticipates this will continue in current and new markets.

As at 30 June 2024, the consolidated statement of financial position reflects a net asset position of  $75,912,603 (30 June 2023:$ 77,122,909). The EBITDA growth along with a strong balance sheet with minimal debt and a solid cash balance provides the Group the flexibility to execute on strategic initiatives.

# Directors' report

The following table summarises key reconciling items between statutory loss after income tax and EBITDA:

<table><tr><td rowspan="3"></td><td colspan="2">Consolidated</td></tr><tr><td>2024</td><td>2023</td></tr><tr><td>$</td><td>$</td></tr><tr><td>Revenue</td><td>66,236,058</td><td>61,769,967</td></tr><tr><td>Less: Direct employee costs</td><td>(18,375,556)</td><td>(20,750,957)</td></tr><tr><td>Less: Other direct costs including inventory expenses</td><td>(5,389,045)</td><td>(4,158,191)</td></tr><tr><td>Gross profit*</td><td>42,471,457</td><td>36,860,819</td></tr><tr><td>Add: Other revenue**</td><td>-</td><td>456,469</td></tr><tr><td>Less: Indirect costs or overheads</td><td>(42,767,740)</td><td>(39,623,352)</td></tr><tr><td>Less: Income tax expense</td><td>(1,044,713)</td><td>(1,711,000)</td></tr><tr><td>Loss after income tax expense</td><td>(1,340,996)</td><td>(4,017,064)</td></tr><tr><td>Add: Finance costs</td><td>162,487</td><td>761,594</td></tr><tr><td>Add: Income tax expense</td><td>1,044,713</td><td>1,711,000</td></tr><tr><td>Less: Interest income</td><td>(164,822)</td><td>(50,169)</td></tr><tr><td>Loss before interest and taxation (EBIT)</td><td>(298,618)</td><td>(1,594,639)</td></tr><tr><td>Depreciation and amortisation expense</td><td>4,410,473</td><td>4,905,191</td></tr><tr><td>EBITDA</td><td>4,111,855</td><td>3,310,552</td></tr></table>

EBITDA for the Group was  $4,111,855 (2023:$ 3,310,552), showing significant progress in the Group's performance compared to the previous year.

# Liquidity

The Group continued to improve on all financial metrics over the past 12 months. The consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the year ended 30 June 2024 reflects a net loss after income tax of \(1,340,996 (2023: \\)4,017,064)\( and the consolidated statement of cash flows reflects net cash inflows from operating activities of \)3,566,414\( (2023: \)3,477,003). As at 30 June 2024, the consolidated statement of financial position reflects a net asset position of \)75,912,603 (2023: net asset of \(77,122,909)\( and a net current asset position of \)12,652,780 (2023: net current asset of \)10,395,527). While revenue for the period was up \(7.2\%\), this was primarily driven by growth in technology sales (hardware and SaaS), which provide improved margins over human driven captioning services, and comprised \(50\%\) of total revenue for the year (2023: \(39\%\)). The Group, with a robust balance sheet featuring a cash balance of nearly \)10.9 million, no debt and improving performance, is now well-positioned to confidently pursue growth opportunities as they arise.

The directors have assessed that based on the Group's position it is appropriate to prepare the financial report on a going concern basis. For further information, refer to note 2.

# Business risks

The following is a summary of material business risks that could adversely affect the Group's financial performance and growth potential in future years and how the Group propose to mitigate such risks.

# Macroeconomic risks

The Group's financial performance can be impacted by current and future economic conditions which it cannot control, such as increases in interest rates and inflation and foreign currency fluctuations. The Group stays abreast of these conditions, focuses on its internal debtor controls and diversifies its customer base by industry and geography and the natural currency hedge which all help to manage these risks.

# Directors' report

# Recruitment

It is evident that the labour landscape has displayed a trend of increasing availability since COVID-19 within sectors such as technology, sales, operations, and professional services. However, labour market tightness persists as a noteworthy consideration. While inflationary pressures have also shown signs of stabilising, the consequences stemming from these pressures throughout the past year have led to a notable salary escalation of up to  $10\%$  beyond the initially budgeted projections for positions demanding professional expertise or high-level skills.

# Competitive market and changes to market trends

The Group operates in a highly competitive market. Innovation is constant and competitive superior products that may be released to the market could result in pricing pressures on our product suite and result in unfavourable product positioning within the market. The Group seeks to mitigate this risk through maintaining experienced product development teams that remain abreast of the latest technological advances, developing leading edge technology, building deep customer relationships and monitoring all potential competitive impacts on the business, and current and future products.

# Disruption to, or failure of, technology systems and software, including cybersecurity breaches

The risk of system disruption, either malicious or accidental, is something that can never be completely mitigated against as technology and methods of potential disruption are, by definition, constantly changing. We manage this risk in diverse ways, including utilising third parties to proactively review our environments and make recommendations for improvement, focusing on monitoring and reporting back so we can be aware of any changes as they happen (before causing noticeable disruption). This enables us to make certain that we have backups and methods in place to reproduce our data and materials from scratch in case a worst-case scenario does happen.

# Data protection and privacy laws

Data protection and privacy laws are regularly being implemented and updated across many jurisdictions globally. This could be a risk if we are not aware of the changes or not able to comply and therefore, we need to make sure we are actively and constantly monitoring changes. We look to minimise this risk by basing our data protection and privacy standards on the most robust jurisdictions in order to aid in global compliance.

# Significant changes in the state of affairs

There were no significant changes in the state of affairs of the Group during the financial year.

# Matters subsequent to the end of the financial year

After the reporting period, a new director, Brent Cubis, joined the board. He was appointed on 1 July 2024. This event does not require adjustment to the financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2024, but is significant for the ongoing operations and governance of the Group.

No other matter or circumstance has arisen since 30 June 2024 that has significantly affected, or may significantly affect the Group's operations, the results of those operations, or the Group's state of affairs in future financial years.

# Likely developments and expected results of operations

With the success of LEXI Live now outperforming expensive human workflows, the Group's growth strategy is focused on exploiting its strengths as the clear leader in the provision of the highest quality AI-driven live captioning in the North American and Australian markets to further grow in three key directions:

- Geographic expansion: utilise the leadership in North America and Australia to grow aggressively in EMEA, APAC and Latin America;  
- Beyond broadcast: AI-driven language services have latent demand in Government, Enterprise and Education sectors. AIM's focus in coming years is to increase the percentage of revenue generated by sectors outside of broadcast; and  
- Drive adoption of new AI-powered LEXI products: Continuing to expand the LEXI Toolkit and grow sales outside of Live Captioning into LEXI Recorded, LEXI Translate, LEXI Audio Description, LEXI Voice, LEXI Dub, LEXI DR and LEXI Library.

The Group will continue to drive organic growth, partnership opportunities for new sales channels and consider acquisition opportunities to accelerate sales momentum.

# Directors' report

# Remuneration report (audited)

The remuneration report details the key management personnel remuneration arrangements for the Group, in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and its Regulations.

Key management personnel are those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the entity, directly or indirectly, including all directors.

The remuneration report is set out under the following main headings:

- Principles used to determine the nature and amount of remuneration  
Details of remuneration  
Service agreements  
- Share-based compensation  
Additional information  
Additional disclosures relating to key management personnel

# Principles used to determine the nature and amount of remuneration

The objective of the Group's executive reward framework is to ensure reward for performance is competitive and appropriate for the results delivered. The framework aligns executive reward with the achievement of strategic objectives and the creation of value for shareholders, and it is considered to conform to the market best practice for the delivery of reward. The Board of Directors (the Board) ensures that executive reward satisfies the following key criteria for good reward governance practices:

- competitiveness and reasonableness;  
acceptability to shareholders;  
performance linkage / alignment of executive compensation; and  
transparency.

The Remuneration and Nomination Committee is responsible for determining and reviewing remuneration arrangements for its directors and executives. The performance of the Group depends on the quality of its directors and executives. The remuneration philosophy is to attract, motivate and retain high performance and high quality personnel.

The Remuneration and Nomination Committee has structured an executive remuneration framework that is market competitive and complementary to the reward strategy of the Group.

The reward framework is designed to align executive reward to shareholders' interests. The Board has considered that it should seek to enhance shareholders' interests by:

having economic profit as a core component of plan design;  
- focusing on sustained growth in shareholder wealth, consisting of dividends and growth in share price, and delivering constant or increasing return on assets as well as focusing the executive on key non-financial drivers of value; and  
- attracting and retaining high calibre executives.

Additionally, the reward framework should seek to enhance executives' interests by:

rewarding capability and experience;  
- reflecting competitive reward for contribution to growth in shareholder wealth; and  
- providing a clear structure for earning rewards.

In accordance with best practice corporate governance, the structure of non-executive director and executive director remuneration is separate.

# Non-executive directors' remuneration

Fees and payments to non-executive directors reflect the demands and responsibilities of their role. Non-executive directors' fees and payments are reviewed annually by the Remuneration and Nomination Committee. The Remuneration and Nomination Committee may, from time to time, receive advice from independent remuneration consultants to ensure nonexecutive directors' fees and payments are appropriate and in line with the market. The chair's fees are determined independently to the fees of other non-executive directors based on comparative roles in the external market. The chair is not present at any discussions relating to the determination of his own remuneration.

ASX listing rules require the aggregate non-executive directors' remuneration be determined periodically by a general meeting. The most recent determination was at the Annual General Meeting held on 9 August 2020, where the shareholders approved a maximum annual aggregate remuneration of $500,000.

# Directors' report

# Executive remuneration

The Group aims to reward executives based on their position and responsibility, with a level and mix of remuneration which has both fixed and variable components.

The executive remuneration and reward framework has three components:

- base pay and non-monetary benefits;  
short-term performance incentives; and  
- other remuneration such as superannuation and long service leave.

The combination of these comprises the executive's total remuneration.

Fixed remuneration, consisting of base salary, superannuation and non-monetary benefits, are reviewed annually by the Remuneration and Nomination Committee based on individual and business unit performance, the overall performance of the Group and comparable market remunerations.

Executives may receive their fixed remuneration in the form of cash or other fringe benefits (for example motor vehicle benefits) where it does not create any additional costs to the Group and provides additional value to the executive.

The short-term incentives (STI) program includes salaries, annual leave and other short term incentive payments and is designed to align the targets of the business units with the performance hurdles of executives. STI payments are granted to executives based on specific annual targets and key performance indicators (KPI's) being achieved. KPI's include profit contribution, customer satisfaction, leadership contribution and product management.

The long-term benefits include long service leave.

# Consolidated entity performance and link to remuneration

Remuneration for certain individuals is directly linked to the performance of the Group. A portion of cash bonus and incentive payments are dependent on EBITDA targets being met. The remaining portion of the cash bonus and incentive payments are at the discretion of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee. Refer to the section 'Additional information' below for details of the earnings and total shareholders return for the last five years.

The Remuneration and Nomination Committee is of the opinion that the continued improved results can be attributed in part to the adoption of performance based compensation and is satisfied that this improvement will continue to increase shareholder wealth if maintained over the coming years.

# Use of remuneration consultants

During the financial year ended 30 June 2024, the Group engaged the use of remuneration consultants, Guerdon Associates, to benchmark its existing remuneration policies, including Executive and CEO remuneration practices, to ensure they adhere to the Groups practices noted above. The benchmarking was also used to analyse the peer group market and seek to improve both the Group's Short Term Incentives and Long Term Incentives programs for future financial years.

Voting and comments made at the Company's 30 June 2023 Annual General Meeting (AGM)

At the 27 October 2023 AGM,  $99.56\%$  of the votes received supported the adoption of the remuneration report for the year ended 30 June 2023. The Company did not receive any specific feedback at the AGM regarding its remuneration practices.

# Notes to the consolidated financial statements

# Note 1. General information

The financial statements cover Ai-Media Technologies Limited as a Group consisting of Ai-Media Technologies Limited (Company or parent entity) and the entities it controlled at the end of, or during, the year (referred to in these financial statements as the Group). The financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, which is Ai-Media Technologies Limited's functional and presentation currency.

Ai-Media Technologies Limited (formerly known as Access Innovation Holdings Limited) is an ASX listed public company limited by shares, incorporated and domiciled in Australia. Its registered office and principal place of business are:

# Registered office

Level 20

15 William Street

Melbourne VIC 3000

# Principal place of business

Level 1

103 Miller Street

North Sydney NSW 2060

A description of the nature of the Group's operations and its principal activities are included in the directors' report, which is not part of the financial statements.

The financial statements were authorised for issue, in accordance with a resolution of directors, on 28 August 2024. The directors have the power to amend and reissue the financial statements.

# Note 2. Material accounting policy information

The accounting policies that are material to the Group are set out below. The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year, unless otherwise stated.

# New or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations adopted

The Group has adopted all of the new, revised or amending Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) that are mandatory for the current reporting period. The adoption of these Accounting Standards and Interpretations did not have any significant impact on the financial performance or position of the Group.

Any new or amended Accounting Standards or Interpretations that are not yet mandatory have not been early adopted.

The following Accounting Standards and Interpretations have been adopted from 1 July 2023:

# AASB 2021-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Disclosure of Accounting Policies and Definition of Accounting Estimates

AASB 2021-2 was issued in March 2021 and is applicable to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. This standard amends AASB Standards to improve accounting policy disclosures so that they provide more useful information to investors and users of the financial statements and clarifies the distinction between accounting policies and accounting estimates. Specifically, AASB 2021-2 amends:

- AASB 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, to clarify that information about measurement bases for financial instruments is expected to be material to an entity's financial statements.  
- AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements, to require entities to disclose their material accounting policy information rather than their significant accounting policies.  
- AASB 108 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, to clarify how entities should distinguish changes in accounting policies and changes in accounting estimates.  
- AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting, to identify material accounting policy information as a component of a complete set of financial statements.  
- AASB Practice Statement 2 Making Materiality Judgements, to provide non-mandatory guidance on how to apply the concept of materiality to accounting policy disclosures.

# Notes to the consolidated financial statements

# Note 2. Material accounting policy information (continued)

# AASB 2021-5 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction

AASB 2021-5 was issued in June 2021 and is applicable to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. The standard amends AASB 112 to clarify that the initial recognition exemption from the requirement to recognise deferred tax does not apply to transactions for which entities recognise both an asset and a liability and that give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. Such transactions include leases and decommissioning, restoration and similar obligations. For lease accounting, the implication is that where the entity has adopted an accounting policy that attributes the tax deduction as being directly related to the repayment of the lease liability, a deferred tax asset will arise on initial recognition of the lease liability, and a deferred tax liability will be recognised on initial recognition of the related component of the lease asset's cost. Alternatively, where the entity attributes the tax deduction as being related to the consumption of the right-of-use asset, the deferred tax liability and deferred tax asset are both attributable to the recognition of the right-of-use asset and will net off resulting in no deferred tax recognised. The amendments to AASB 1 require deferred tax related to such transactions to be recognised by first-time adopters at the date of transaction to AASBs.

# Comparative information

Certain comparatives in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income have been reclassified to conform with the current year disclosure. The reclassification of the comparatives has not changed the net results for the prior year.

# Going concern

The financial report has been prepared on the going concern basis which contemplates the continuity of normal business activities and the realisation of assets and settlement of liabilities in the ordinary course of business and assumes the Group will have sufficient cash resources to pay their debts as and when they become due and payable for at least 12 months from the date of signing the financial report.

The consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the year ended 30 June 2024 reflects a net loss after income tax of  $1,340,996 (30 June 2023:$ 4,017,064) and the consolidated statement of cash flows reflects net cash inflows from operating activities of  $3,566,414 (30 June 2023:$ 3,477,003). As at 30 June 2024, the consolidated statement of financial position reflects a net asset position of  $75,912,603 (30 June 2023: net asset of$ 77,122,909) and a net current asset position of $12,652,780 (30 June 2023: net current asset of $10,395,527). While the Group continues to experience losses it is taking the necessary action to grow revenue sustainably and ensure that it will become profitable in the near future.

Based upon the growth of the business achieved to date, sufficient cash reserves at reporting date and after reviewing forecasts and projections prepared for the business, the directors are confident that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis.

# Basis of preparation

These general purpose financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) and the Corporations Act 2001, as appropriate for for-profit oriented entities. These financial statements also comply with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).

# Historical cost convention

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.

# Critical accounting estimates

The preparation of the financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in note 3.

# Parent entity information

In accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, these financial statements present the results of the Group only. Supplementary information about the parent entity is disclosed in note 30.

# Principles of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets and liabilities of all subsidiaries of Ai-Media Technologies Limited as at 30 June 2024 and the results of all subsidiaries for the year then ended.

# Notes to the consolidated financial statements

# Note 2. Material accounting policy information (continued)

Subsidiaries are all those entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.

Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between entities in the Group are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of the impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. A change in ownership interest, without the loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction, where the difference between the consideration transferred and the book value of the share of the non-controlling interest acquired is recognised directly in equity attributable to the parent.

Where the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets including goodwill, liabilities and non-controlling interest in the subsidiary together with any cumulative translation differences recognised in equity. The Group recognises the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any investment retained together with any gain or loss in profit or loss.

# Operating segments

Operating segments are presented using the 'management approach', where the information presented is on the same basis as the internal reports provided to the Chief Operating Decision Makers (CODM). The CODM is responsible for the allocation of resources to operating segments and assessing their performance.

# Foreign currency translation

# Foreign currency transactions

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the Company's functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at financial year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss.

# Foreign operations

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars using the exchange rates at the reporting date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars using the average exchange rates, which approximate the rates at the dates of the transactions, for the period. All resulting foreign exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income through the foreign currency reserve in equity.

The foreign currency reserve is recognised in profit or loss when the foreign operation or net investment is disposed of.

# Revenue recognition

The Group recognises revenue as follows:

# Revenue from contracts with customers

Revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group is expected to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. For each contract with a customer, the Group: identifies the contract with a customer; identifies the performance obligations in the contract; determines the transaction price which takes into account estimates of variable consideration and the time value of money; allocates the transaction price to the separate performance obligations on the basis of the relative stand-alone selling price of each distinct good or service to be delivered; and recognises revenue when or as each performance obligation is satisfied in a manner that depicts the transfer to the customer of the goods or services promised.

# Notes to the consolidated financial statements

# Note 2. Material accounting policy information (continued)

Variable consideration within the transaction price, if any, reflects concessions provided to the customer such as discounts, rebates and refunds, any potential bonuses receivable from the customer and any other contingent events. Such estimates are determined using either the 'expected value' or 'most likely amount' method. The measurement of variable consideration is subject to a constraining principle whereby revenue will only be recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur. The measurement constraint continues until the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Amounts received that are subject to the constraining principle are recognised as a refund liability. During the year, variable consideration comprised of immaterial discounts to certain customers.

# Revenue from services

Revenue from a contract to provide services is recognised over time for all live captioning, as customers simultaneously receive and consume captioning services as live captioned events occur. All recorded captioning is recognised at a point in time, at such time that the customers gains control of and derives the benefits from the completed captioned medium(s) produced and incurs the obligation to pay for completed captioning. Revenue from services primarily have payment terms of 30-60 days.

# Hardware

Revenue from a contract to provide goods (computer hardware, parts, and hardware rentals) are recognised at a point in time based on the Incoterm Ex works which is a shipping arrangement where the seller makes product available for pick up at a specific location and the buyer pays for the transport costs. The goods are picked up for delivery and loaded into the carrier's vehicle which is when the title, risks and rewards pass from the seller to the buyer, and it is when the Company invoices the client.

# Software as a Service

Software as a service (SaaS) are electronically delivered software that are categorized as single contract for services or multiple deliverable arrangements depending on the terms of the license or subscription. Revenue is recognised either proportionally over the term of the license or subscription agreement, which is when the stand-alone performance obligation(s) are satisfied, or at the point of consumption, when the service is delivered based on usage.

# Interest

Interest revenue is recognised as interest accrues using the effective interest method. This is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset and allocating the interest income over the relevant period using the effective interest rate, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.

# Other revenue

Other revenue is recognised at a point in time when it is received or when the right to receive payment is established. Other income is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group is expected to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer.

# Income tax

The income tax expense or benefit for the period is the tax payable on that period's taxable income based on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction, adjusted by the changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences, unused tax losses and the adjustment recognised for prior periods, where applicable.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences at the tax rates expected to be applied when the assets are recovered or liabilities are settled, based on those tax rates that are enacted or substantively enacted, except for:

- When the deferred income tax asset or liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting nor taxable profits; or  
- When the taxable temporary difference is associated with interests in subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures, and the timing of the reversal can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses.

# Notes to the consolidated financial statements

# Note 2. Material accounting policy information (continued)

The carrying amount of recognised and unrecognised deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date. Deferred tax assets recognised are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that future taxable profits will be available for the carrying amount to be recovered. Previously unrecognised deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that there are future taxable profits available to recover the asset.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and deferred tax assets against deferred tax liabilities; and they relate to the same taxable authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities which intend to settle simultaneously.

Ai-Media Technologies Limited (the 'head entity') and its wholly-owned Australian subsidiaries have formed an income tax consolidated group under the tax consolidation regime. The head entity and each subsidiary in the tax consolidated group continue to account for their own current and deferred tax amounts. The tax consolidated group has applied the 'separate taxpayer within group' approach in determining the appropriate amount of taxes to allocate to members of the tax consolidated group.

In addition to its own current and deferred tax amounts, the head entity also recognises the current tax liabilities (or assets) and the deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses and unused tax credits assumed from each subsidiary in the tax consolidated group.

Assets or liabilities arising under tax funding agreements with the tax consolidated entities are recognised as amounts receivable from or payable to other entities in the tax consolidated group. The tax funding arrangement ensures that the intercompany charge equals the current tax liability or benefit of each tax consolidated group member, resulting in neither a contribution by the head entity to the subsidiaries nor a distribution by the subsidiaries to the head entity.

# Current and non-current classification

Assets and liabilities are presented in the statement of financial position based on current and non-current classification.

An asset is classified as current when: it is either expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in the Group's normal operating cycle; it is held primarily for the purpose of trading; it is expected to be realised within 12 months after the reporting period; or the asset is cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period. All other assets are classified as non-current.

A liability is classified as current when: it is either expected to be settled in the Group's normal operating cycle; it is held primarily for the purpose of trading; it is due to be settled within 12 months after the reporting period; or there is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period. All other liabilities are classified as non-current.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are always classified as non-current.

# Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

# Trade and other receivables

Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any allowance for expected credit losses.

Contract receivables represent receivables in respect of which the Group's right to consideration is unconditional subject only to the passage of time. Contract receivables are non-derivative financial assets accounted for in accordance with the Group's accounting policy for non-derivative financial assets for expected credit losses. Trade receivables are generally due for settlement within 30-60 days.

The Group has applied the simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses, which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on days overdue.

Other receivables are recognised at amortised cost, less any allowance for expected credit losses.

# Notes to the consolidated financial statements

# Note 2. Material accounting policy information (continued)

# Inventories

Finished goods are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value on a weighted average cost basis. Cost comprises of purchase and delivery costs, net of rebates and discounts received or receivable.

# Property, plant and equipment

Plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis to write off the net cost of each item of property, plant and equipment (excluding land) over their expected useful lives as follows:

Buildings

Leasehold improvements

Plant and equipment

30 years

Over the lease term

3 to 5 years

The residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date.

Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the unexpired period of the lease or the estimated useful life of the assets, whichever is shorter.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when there is no future economic benefit to the Group. Gains and losses between the carrying amount and the disposal proceeds are taken to profit or loss.

# Intangible assets

Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination, other than goodwill, are initially measured at their fair value at the date of the acquisition. Intangible assets acquired separately are initially recognised at cost. Indefinite life intangible assets are not amortised and are subsequently measured at cost less any impairment. Finite life intangible assets are subsequently measured at cost less amortisation and any impairment. The gains or losses recognised in profit or loss arising from the derecognition of intangible assets are measured as the difference between net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the intangible asset. The method and useful lives of finite life intangible assets are reviewed annually. Changes in the expected pattern of consumption or useful life are accounted for prospectively by changing the amortisation method or period.

# Goodwill

Goodwill arises on the acquisition of a business and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment losses on goodwill are taken to profit or loss and are not subsequently reversed.

# Development

Development costs are capitalised when: it is probable that the project will be a success considering its commercial and technical feasibility; the Group is able to use or sell the asset; the Group has sufficient resources and intent to complete the development; and its costs can be measured reliably. Capitalised development costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of their expected benefit, being their finite life of 4 years.

# Intellectual property

Significant costs associated with intellectual property are deferred and amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of its expected benefit, being its finite life of 10 years.

# Brand name and trademarks

Brand name and trademarks arise on the acquisition of a business and are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Brand name and trademarks are assessed to have indefinite lives as there is no indication that the useful life of the asset will end in the reasonably foreseeable future and there is no way to reliably determine when the assets will cease having economic value. This is reassessed every year. Instead, it is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired, and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

# Customer contracts

Customer contracts acquired in a business combination are amortised on a straight-line basis over the revised period of their expected benefit, being their finite life of 3 to 10 years (2023: 3 to 10 years).

# Notes to the consolidated financial statements

# Note 2. Material accounting policy information (continued)

# Software

Significant costs associated with software are deferred and amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of its expected benefit, being its finite life, which varies from 7 to 10 years.

# Impairment of non-financial assets

Goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired. Other non-financial assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.

Recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs of disposal and value-in-use. The value-in-use is the present value of the estimated future cash flows relating to the asset using a pre-tax discount rate specific to the asset or cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Assets that do not have independent cash flows are grouped together to form a cash-generating unit.

# Trade and other payables

Trade and other payables represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of the financial year and which are unpaid. Due to their short-term nature they are measured at amortised cost and are not discounted. The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days of recognition.

# Finance costs

Finance costs attributable to qualifying assets are capitalised as part of the asset. All other finance costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.

# Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present (legal or constructive) obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable the Group will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. If the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate specific to the liability. The increase in the provision resulting from the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.

# Employee benefits

# Short-term employee benefits

Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits, annual leave and long service leave expected to be settled wholly within 12 months of the reporting date are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled.

# Other long-term employee benefits

The liability for annual leave and long service leave not expected to be settled within 12 months of the reporting date are measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service. Expected future payments are discounted using market yields at the reporting date on high quality corporate bonds with terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows.

# Defined contribution superannuation expense

Contributions to defined contribution superannuation plans are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.

# Share-based payments

Equity-settled and cash-settled share-based compensation benefits are provided to employees.

Equity-settled transactions are awards of shares, or options over shares, that are provided to employees in exchange for the rendering of services.

# Notes to the consolidated financial statements

# Note 2. Material accounting policy information (continued)

The cost of equity-settled transactions are measured at fair value on grant date. Fair value is independently determined using either the Binomial or Black-Scholes option pricing model that takes into account the exercise price, the term of the option, the impact of dilution, the share price at grant date and expected price volatility of the underlying share, the expected dividend yield and the risk free interest rate for the term of the option, together with non-vesting conditions that do not determine whether the Group receives the services that entitle the employees to receive payment. No account is taken of any other vesting conditions.

The cost of equity-settled transactions are recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity over the vesting period. The cumulative charge to profit or loss is calculated based on the grant date fair value of the award, the best estimate of the number of awards that are likely to vest and the expired portion of the vesting period. The amount recognised in profit or loss for the period is the cumulative amount calculated at each reporting date less amounts already recognised in previous periods.

Market conditions are taken into consideration in determining fair value. Therefore, any awards subject to market conditions are considered to vest irrespective of whether or not that market condition has been met, provided all other conditions are satisfied.

If equity-settled awards are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the modification has not been made. An additional expense is recognised, over the remaining vesting period, for any modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based compensation benefit as at the date of modification.

If the non-vesting condition is within the control of the Group or employee, the failure to satisfy the condition is treated as a cancellation. If the condition is not within the control of the Group or employee and is not satisfied during the vesting period, any remaining expense for the award is recognised over the remaining vesting period, unless the award is forfeited.

If equity-settled awards are cancelled, they are treated as if they had vested on the date of cancellation, and any remaining expense is recognised immediately. If a new replacement award is substituted for the cancelled award, the cancelled and new award is treated as if they were a modification.

# Fair value measurement

When an asset or liability, financial or non-financial, is measured at fair value for recognition or disclosure purposes, the fair value is based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date; and assumes that the transaction will take place either: in the principal market; or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market.

Fair value is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming they act in their economic best interests. For non-financial assets, the fair value measurement is based on its highest and best use. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value are those that are appropriate in the circumstances and which maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs.

# Issued capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity.

Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.

# Earnings per share

# Basic earnings per share

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the owners of Ai-Media Technologies Limited, excluding any costs of servicing equity other than ordinary shares, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year, adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary shares issued during the financial year.

# Diluted earnings per share

Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account the after income tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares and the weighted average number of additional ordinary shares that would have been outstanding assuming conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.

# Notes to the consolidated financial statements

# Note 2. Material accounting policy information (continued)

# Goods and Services Tax (GST) and other similar taxes

Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of associated GST, unless the GST incurred is not recoverable from the tax authority. In this case it is recognised as part of the cost of the acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense.

Receivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST receivable or payable. The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the tax authority is included in other receivables or other payables in the statement of financial position.

Cash flows are presented on a gross basis. The GST components of cash flows arising from investing or financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to the tax authority, are presented as operating cash flows.

Commitments and contingencies are disclosed net of the amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the tax authority.

# New Accounting Standards and Interpretations not yet mandatory or early adopted

Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations that have recently been issued or amended but are not yet mandatory, have not been early adopted by the Group for the annual reporting period ended 30 June 2024. The Group has assessed that there will be no significant impact on adoption of these new or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations, except for AASB 18, as explained below. The new or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations, most relevant to the Group, are set out below.

# AASB 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements

This standard is applicable to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027, with early adoption permitted. The standard replaces AASB 101 'Presentation of Financial Statements', although many of the requirements have been carried forward unchanged and is accompanied by limited amendments to the requirements in AASB 107 'Statement of Cash Flows'. The standard requires income and expenses to be classified into five categories: 'Operating' (residual category if income and expenses are not classified into another category), 'Investing', 'Financing', 'Income taxes' and 'Discontinued operations'. The standard introduces two mandatory sub-totals: 'Operating profit' and 'Profit before finance and income taxes'. There are also new disclosure requirements for 'management-defined performance measures', such as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation ('EBITDA') or 'adjusted profit'. The standard provides enhanced guidance on how to organise and group information (aggregation and disaggregation) in the financial statements and whether to provide it in the primary financial statements or in the notes. The Group will adopt this standard from 1 July 2027 and it is expected that there will be a significant change to the layout of the statement of profit or loss.

# AASB 2020-1 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current and AASB 2022-6 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Non-current Liabilities with Covenants

AASB 2020-1 was issued in March 2020 and is applicable to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024, as extended by AASB 2020-6. Early adoption is permitted. AASB 2022-6 was issued in December 2022 and is applicable to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024. Early adoption is permitted where AASB 2020-1 is also early adopted.

These standards amend AASB 101 'Presentation of Financial Statements' to clarify requirements for the presentation of liabilities in the statement of financial position as current or non-current. The amendments clarify that a liability is classified as non-current if an entity has the right at the end of the reporting period to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period. If the deferral right is subject to the entity complying with covenants in the loan arrangement based on information up to and including reporting date, the deferral right will exist where the entity is able to comply with the covenant on or before the end of the reporting date even if compliance is assessed after the reporting date. The deferral right will be deemed to exist at reporting date if the entity is required to comply with the covenant only after the reporting date based on post-reporting date information. Additional disclosure is required about loan arrangements classified as non-current liabilities in such circumstances which enables users of financial statements to understand the risk that the liabilities could become repayable within twelve months after the reporting period. Classification of a liability as non-current is unaffected by the likelihood that the entity will exercise its right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date or even if the entity settles the liability prior to issue of the financial statements. The meaning of settlement of a liability is also clarified. The Group does not expect these amendments to have a material impact.

# Notes to the consolidated financial statements

# Note 3. Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions

The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements. Management continually evaluates its judgements and estimates in relation to assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities, revenue and expenses. Management bases its judgements, estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on other various factors, including expectations of future events, management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.

The resulting accounting judgements and estimates will seldom equal the related actual results. The judgements, estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities (refer to the respective notes) within the next financial year are discussed below.

# Best estimate judgements on present obligations

The amount recognised as a provision shall be the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period. Management take into account the probability weighting of the most likely outcome when recognising provisions which involves key judgements.

# Estimation of useful lives of assets

The Group determines the estimated useful lives and related depreciation and amortisation charges for its property, plant and equipment and finite life intangible assets. The useful lives could change significantly as a result of technical innovations or some other event. The depreciation and amortisation charge will increase where the useful lives are less than previously estimated lives, or technically obsolete or non-strategic assets that have been abandoned or sold will be written off or written down.

# Goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets

The Group tests annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment, whether goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets have suffered any impairment in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note 2.

# Recovery of deferred tax assets

Deferred tax assets are recognised when the Group believes it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available for utilizing tax losses and deductible temporary differences. Currently, the group holds notable tax losses and Research and Development credit balances in Australia and its overseas entities. The projected sustained profitability in Australia over the forthcoming years is expected to facilitate the utilisation of these Deferred Tax Assets (DTA), attributed in part to recent modifications in corporate recharge strategies and the inclusion of intercompany loan interest.

# Note 4. Operating segments

# Identification of reportable operating segments

The Group is organised into three operating segments based on geographical locations: Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, and Malaysia (APAC); North America (including Canada and the United States of America); and the United Kingdom (EMEA). The Chief Operating Decision Makers (CODM) have reviewed and redefined these segments. Previously, the segments were Australia and New Zealand (ANZ), North America (including Canada and the United States of America), and Rest of the World (ROW) (including the United Kingdom, Singapore, and Malaysia). The Group's operating segments have been updated to reflect the organisation's strategic focus and growth objectives. These operating segments are based on the internal reports that are reviewed and used by the Board of Directors (who are identified as the CODM) in assessing performance and in determining the allocation of resources. There is no aggregation of operating segments.

The CODM reviews EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation). The accounting policies adopted for internal reporting to the CODM are consistent with those adopted in the financial statements.

The information reported to the CODM is on a monthly basis.

The CODM does not regularly review segment assets and segment liabilities. Refer to statement of financial position for assets and liabilities.

# Major customers

During the year 30 June 2024 and 30 June 2023, there were no customers exceeding  $10\%$  of the Group's revenue.

# Impairment test for goodwill

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group's cash generating units (CGU), or groups of CGUs, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combinations. Each unit or groups of units to which goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level at which assets are monitored for internal management purposes.

The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to the CGUs as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan="3"></td><td colspan="2">Consolidated</td></tr><tr><td>2024</td><td>2023</td></tr><tr><td>$</td><td>$</td></tr><tr><td>North America</td><td>44,591,714</td><td>45,089,767</td></tr><tr><td>EMEA</td><td>448,131</td><td>447,619</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>45,039,845</td><td>45,537,386</td></tr></table>

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. The goodwill associated with the North America CGU, arose through company acquisitions. Subsequent to the acquisition, the subsidiaries continued to operate ahead of expectations and the Group is benefiting from the synergies of the combination in the North America CGU. The recoverable amount of the cash-generating units is determined based on a value in use calculation which uses cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by the directors covering a five-year period.

The directors have assessed the recoverable amount of the North America CGU, using discount cash flow model, is in excess of the carrying amount. The model used a discount rate of  $12\%$  (2023:  $12\%$ ), an average growth rate of  $19\%$  (2023:  $9\%$ ) for the next 5 years and a terminal growth rate of  $3\%$  (2023:  $3\%$ ).

The directors have assessed the recoverable amount of the EMEA CGU, using discount cash flow model, is in excess of the carrying amount. The model used a discount rate of  $12\%$  (2023:  $12\%$ ), an average growth rate of  $39\%$  (2023:  $20\%$ ) for the next 5 years and a terminal growth rate of  $3\%$  (2023:  $3\%$ ).

Despite the absence of goodwill in the Australia CGU, the management proceeded to assess the recoverable amount of the Australia CGU, ensuring that it exceeded the carrying amount of its assets. The model used a discount rate of  $12\%$  (2023:  $12\%$ ), an average growth rate of  $1\%$  (2023:  $3\%$ ) for the next 5 years and a terminal growth rate of  $3\%$  (2023:  $3\%$ ). The evaluation of the recoverable amount, conducted using a discounted cash flow model, revealed a headroom over the carrying amount of the assets.

# Sensitivity analysis

The Group has conducted an analysis of the sensitivity of the impairment test to changes in the key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for each of the group of CGUs to which goodwill is allocated.

On management assumptions, sensitivities are applied to the value-in-use calculations with the associated headroom. The directors believe that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would not cause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed the aggregate recoverable amount of the related CGUs.

# Other payables from acquisitions

# Lease make good

The provision represents the present value of the estimated costs to make good the premises leased by the Group at the end of the respective lease terms.

# Other payables from acquisitions

A USD 4,968,000 (AUD 7,692,784) earn-out payment for the purchase of EEG was due on 29 September 2023 and a deferred liability of USD 280,000 (AUD 436,886) was paid on 13 September 2023.

# Other provisions

Other provisions represent the best estimate of a tax provision associated with the share based payment plan of  $200,000 (2023:$ 550,000) and for other indirect taxes in a foreign subsidiary amounting to $32,468 (2023: $40,941).

# Annual leave and long service leave

The current portion of provision for employee benefits includes the total amount accrued for annual leave entitlements and the amounts accrued for long service leave entitlements that have vested due to employees having completed the required year of service. Based on past experience, the Group does not expect the full amount of annual leave balances classified as current provisions to be settled within the next 12 months. However, these amounts must be classified as current, since the Group does not have an unconditional right to defer the settlement of these amounts in the event employees wish to use their leave entitlement.

# Notes to the consolidated financial statements

# Note 20. Issued capital (continued)

# Ordinary shares

Ordinary shares entitle the holder to participate in any dividends declared and any proceeds attributable to shareholders should the Company be wound up in proportions that consider both the number of shares held and the extent to which those shares are paid up. The fully paid ordinary shares have no par value and the Company does not have a limited amount of authorised capital.

On a show of hands every member present at a meeting in person or by proxy shall have one vote and upon a poll each share shall have one vote.

# Share buy-back

There is no current on-market share buy-back.

# Capital risk management

The Group's objectives when managing capital is to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimum capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

Capital is regarded as total equity, as recognised in the statement of financial position, plus net debt. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.

The Group would look to raise capital when an opportunity to invest in a business or company was seen as value adding relative to the current Company's share price at the time of the investment. The Group is not actively pursuing additional investments in the short term as it continues to integrate and grow its existing businesses in order to maximise synergies.

The capital risk management policy remains unchanged from the 30 June 2023 Annual Report.

# Note 23. Financial instruments

# Financial risk management objectives

The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign currency risk, price risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group's overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group.

Risk management is carried out by senior finance executives (Finance) under frameworks approved by the Board of Directors (the Board). These frameworks include identification and analysis of the risk exposure of the Group and appropriate procedures, controls and risk limits.

# Market risk

# Foreign currency risk

The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currency and is exposed to foreign currency risk through foreign exchange rate fluctuations.

# Notes to the consolidated financial statements

# Note 23. Financial instruments (continued)

Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions and recognised financial assets and financial liabilities denominated in a currency that is not the entity's functional currency. The Group manages this risk with natural currency hedges in the regions it operates. The risk is measured using sensitivity analysis and cash flow forecasting, example sensitivities are provided in the following analysis.

The carrying amount of the Group's foreign currency denominated financial assets and financial liabilities at the reporting date were as follows:

<table><tr><td></td><td colspan="2">Assets</td><td colspan="2">Liabilities</td></tr><tr><td>Consolidated</td><td>2024 $</td><td>2023 $</td><td>2024 $</td><td>2023 $</td></tr><tr><td>Pound sterling</td><td>1,623,941</td><td>1,647,475</td><td>681,147</td><td>499,392</td></tr><tr><td>Canadian dollars</td><td>492,865</td><td>597,207</td><td>203,659</td><td>175,184</td></tr><tr><td>Singapore dollars</td><td>444,994</td><td>441,278</td><td>87,611</td><td>53,160</td></tr><tr><td>US dollars</td><td>13,522,548</td><td>11,710,412</td><td>3,093,286</td><td>9,682,519</td></tr><tr><td>Malaysian ringgit</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>6,716</td><td>12,765</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>16,084,348</td><td>14,396,372</td><td>4,072,419</td><td>10,423,020</td></tr></table>

The Group had net liabilities denominated in foreign currencies of \(12,011,929 (assets of \)16,084,348 less liabilities of \(4,072,419) as at 30 June 2024 (2023: \)3,973,352 (assets of $14,396,372 less liabilities of $10,423,020)). Based on this exposure, had the Australian dollars weakened by 5%/strengthened by 5% (2023: weakened by 5%/strengthened by 5%) against these foreign currencies with all other variables held constant, the Group's profit before tax for the year would have been \(571,997 lower/\)632,207 higher (2023: \)188,207 lower/$209,124 higher) and equity would have been \)400,398 lower/$442,545 higher (2023: \)132,445 lower/$146,387 higher). The percentage change is the expected overall volatility of the significant currencies, which is based on management's assessment of reasonable possible fluctuations taking into consideration movements over the last 12 months each year and the spot rate at each reporting date. The actual foreign exchange gain for the year ended 30 June 2024 was \)168,228 (2023: gain of $149,314).

# Price risk

The Group is not exposed to any significant price risk.

# Interest rate risk

The Group's financial performance can be impacted by current and future economic conditions which it cannot control, such as increases in interest rates and inflation. The Group has no short or long-term borrowings thus, the Group is not exposed to any significant interest rate risk.

# Credit risk

Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. The Group has a strict code of credit, confirming references and setting appropriate credit limits. The Group obtains guarantees where appropriate to mitigate credit risk. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date to recognised financial assets is the carrying amount, net of any provisions for impairment of those assets, as disclosed in the statement of financial position and notes to the financial statements. The Group does not hold any collateral.

The Group has adopted a lifetime expected loss allowance in estimating expected credit losses to trade receivables through the use of a provisions matrix using fixed rates of credit loss provisioning. These provisions are considered representative across all customers of the Group based on recent sales experience, historical collection rates and forward-looking information that is available.

Trade receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Indicators of this include the failure of a debtor to engage in a repayment plan, no active enforcement activity and a failure to make contractual payments for a period greater than 1 year.

# Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk requires the Group to maintain sufficient liquid assets (mainly cash and cash equivalents) to be able to pay debts as and when they become due and payable.

# Notes to the consolidated financial statements

# Note 23. Financial instruments (continued)

The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves by monitoring actual and forecast cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.

# Remaining contractual maturities

The following tables detail the Group's remaining contractual maturity for its financial instrument liabilities. The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the financial liabilities are required to be paid. The tables include both interest and principal cash flows disclosed as remaining contractual maturities (except as noted below) and therefore these totals may differ from their carrying amount in the statement of financial position.

<table><tr><td>Consolidated - 2024</td><td>1 year or less$</td><td>Between 1 and 2 years$</td><td>Between 2 and 5 years$</td><td>Over 5 years$</td><td>Remaining contractual maturities$</td></tr><tr><td>Non-interest bearing</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Trade payables</td><td>1,589,325</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>1,589,325</td></tr><tr><td>Interest-bearing - fixed rate</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Lease liability</td><td>257,589</td><td>120,265</td><td>186,724</td><td>-</td><td>564,578</td></tr><tr><td>Total non-derivatives</td><td>1,846,914</td><td>120,265</td><td>186,724</td><td>-</td><td>2,153,903</td></tr><tr><td>Consolidated - 2023</td><td>1 year or less$</td><td>Between 1 and 2 years$</td><td>Between 2 and 5 years$</td><td>Over 5 years$</td><td>Remaining contractual maturities$</td></tr><tr><td>Non-interest bearing</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Trade payables</td><td>948,716</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>948,716</td></tr><tr><td>Interest-bearing - fixed rate</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Lease liability</td><td>197,808</td><td>152,599</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>350,407</td></tr><tr><td>Other payables from acquisitions</td><td>7,776,772</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>7,776,772</td></tr><tr><td>Total non-derivatives</td><td>8,923,296</td><td>152,599</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>9,075,895</td></tr></table>

# Restricted Share Units (RSUs)

At the time of the IPO in 2020, the Company agreed to grant each Non-Executive Director RSUs to the value of $25,000 per annum for each of the first 3 financial years following the IPO. The first tranche of the 60,705 RSUs was vested and convertible into fully paid ordinary shares of the Company at 30 June 2021 based on the Offer Price under the IPO. The second tranche of 70,391 RSUs was vested as at 30 June 2022 and converted into fully paid ordinary shares of the Company on 7 July 2022. The third tranche of 293,916 RSUs was vested as at 30 Jun 2023 and converted into fully paid ordinary shares of the Company on 7 September 2023.

In determining the fair value at grant date of restricted share units, reference was made to the value of the share-based payment entitlement of  $25,000. A valuation model was not required and no further inputs were considered necessary since the entitlement at grant date has been fixed at$ 25,000.

On 20 December 2021, the Company granted RSUs to ex-ACS employees as part of the acquisition of ACS. 125,061 RSUs were vested and converted into fully paid ordinary shares of the Company on 1 February 2022 based on the offer price under the IPO to the value of $153,824. The second tranche of 252,968 RSUs vested and converted into fully paid ordinary shares of the Company on 20 December 2022 amounted to $72,485. The third tranche of 270,999 RSUs were vested and converted into fully paid ordinary shares of the Company on 7 September 2023 amounted to $75,091.

The share-based payment expense in relation to RSUs for 2024 is $nil (2023: $125,803).

In our opinion, the accompanying financial report of the Group is in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, including:

Giving a true and fair view of the Group's financial position as at 30 June 2024 and of its financial performance for the year then ended; and  
- Complying with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Regulations 2001.

# Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional & Ethical Standards Board's APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the Code) that are relevant to our audit of the financial report in Australia. We have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.

We confirm that the independence declaration required by the Corporations Act 2001, which has been given to the directors of the Company, would be in the same terms if given to the directors as at the time of this auditor's report.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

# Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial report for the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

<table><tr><td>Key Audit Matter</td><td>How the scope of our audit responded to the Key Audit Matter</td></tr><tr><td>Revenue Recognition
For the year ended 30 June 2024, the Group reported total revenue of $66.24 million, of which technology revenue was $32.92m. Technology revenue included Software-as-a-Service (&quot;SaaS&quot;) revenue of $19.57 million which represents subscription, consumption-based and support revenue. The deferred revenue relating to technology revenue amounted to $4.05 million as of 30 June 2024.
Revenue recognition for the consumption-based and deferred revenue is considered a key audit matter for the following reasons:
·Significance of technology revenue: A material portion of this revenue is derived from consumption-based services ($7.97m) and deferred revenue ($4.05m). They represent one of the fastest-growing sources of revenue of the Group.
·Complexity and Automation: Revenue earned in relation to customer usage is determined by hours used and hourly rates, tracked and billed through highly automated systems. Customers are invoiced based on the usage recorded in the automated system. It is critical to understand whether system algorithms are appropriately calculating client usage and hence requires additional audit attention.
·Business Model Transformation and Incentives: The rapid growth in technology revenue and the shift to a SaaS business model, combined with significant management incentives to meet expectations creates additional pressure to achieve revenue targets, further elevating the risk of misstatement.</td><td>Our procedures included, but were not limited to:
·Performed design and implementation tests on the controls related to the preparation and review of the monthly deferred revenue schedule, review of weekly/monthly billings and reconciliations.
·Agreed the total deferred revenue schedule to the unearned revenue recorded in the general ledger. Performed data validation checks on the deferred revenue schedule to check for evidence of error and using the deferred revenue schedule, test the accuracy of formulas and the mathematical accuracy of the schedule.
·For completeness and valuation of deferred revenue, software revenue invoices (through revenue occurrence testing) were traced back to the deferred revenue schedule to verify that they are appropriately and recorded in that schedule.
·Engaged our technology and controls specialists to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the system, focusing on the algorithms used for calculating customer usage and the relevant controls in place.
·Obtained direct confirmations at the transaction level with customers. This confirmation served as the primary evidence to test the occurrence and accuracy of software revenue. Subsequent payments were used as additional evidence, as the payment of invoices indicated customer agreement with the charges.
·Assessed the completeness of revenue by obtaining a sample of transactions recorded from reciprocal populations and making sure that these were recorded in the general ledger.
·Performed analytical review procedures and compared movements in revenue to the prior year.
·Performed cut off testing on a sample basis to assess whether the identified revenue transactions were recorded in the correct period.
·Tested credit notes raised during the year on a sample basis and obtained the relevant invoice, as well as any subsequent invoices to test validity of the credit notes.
·Assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures included in Note 5 of the financial statements.</td></tr></table>

As at 30 June 2024, the Group&#x27;s net assets exceeded the listed market value.Where a cash generating unit (&quot;CGU&quot;) contains goodwill, management is required to conduct annual impairment tests (or more frequently if impairment indicators exist) to assess the recoverable amount of the CGU and the associated goodwill amount. goodwill. This assessment is performed through the preparation of a discounted cash flow model.

# Other Information

The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Group's annual report for the year ended 30 June 2024, but does not include the financial report and our auditor's report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Report

The directors of the Company are responsible:

- For the preparation of the financial report in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, including giving a true and fair view of the financial position and performance of the Group in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards; and  
- For such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, including giving a true and fair view of the financial position and performance of the Group, and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.

As part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.  
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group internal control.  
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.  
- Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.  
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the disclosures, and whether the financial report represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.  
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group's audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

# Independent auditor's report

# Deloitte.

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial report of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
