# Corporate Profile

SSBB is a Malaysian investment holding company listed on the ACE Market of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad ("Bursa Securities"). Together with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Southern Score Sdn. Bhd. ("Southern Score"), SSBB forms the SSBB Group ("the Group"), which is involved in the provision of construction management for high-rise residential buildings and civil infrastructure.

With nearly 15 years of experience, the Group is a Construction Industry Development Board ("CIDB") Grade 7 contractor. It adopts an asset-light and flexible construction management model via outsourcing of construction work that provides scalability and leaner balance sheet while lowering risk exposures. The Group's commitment to quality is also underscored by its adoption of the Industrialised Building System ("IBS"), a modern construction method that utilises prefabricated components for faster and more efficient construction.

The Group's portfolio of projects encompasses high-rise residential, commercial, and specialised buildings across the Klang Valley, such as Vista Sentul Residences, PV9 Residences, PR1MA Jalan Jubilee Residences, Platinum Arena Residences, PV18 Residences, and Platinum Teratai Residences. With a robust track record, the Group has solidified its position as a key player in the Malaysian construction management industry.

The Group has also obtained its shareholders' approval at an Extraordinary General Meeting ("EGM") held on 30 August 2024 to acquire a  $51\%$  -stake in mechanical and electrical ("M&E") specialist, SJEE Engineering Sdn. Bhd. ("SJEE"). The transaction is expected to complete by end-2024. This complements the Group's construction-related offerings, which would effectively expand its capabilities to include M&E services involving the design, installation, and commissioning of electrical works, with a strong expertise in Building Information Modelling ("BIM"). In turn, this move positions the Group in high-value sectors such as data centres and healthcare.

SSBB was listed on the ACE Market of Bursa Securities in November 2022, following the completion of reverse takeover of G Neptune Berhad.

GAN YU CHAI

MANAGING DIRECTOR

Tan Sri Datuk Seri Gan Yu Chai ("Tan Sri Datuk Seri Gan") was appointed to the Board of SSBB on 9 November 2022 as the Managing Director, following the completion of the Company's regularisation plan. Tan Sri Datuk Seri Gan has been serving on the Board of Southern Score since 7 June 2012. He is responsible for shaping Southern Score's strategic direction, overseeing the development and implementation of key business strategies, as well as ensuring its broader corporate development aligns with long-term objectives.

Tan Sri Datuk Seri Gan holds a Diploma in Electronic Engineering from the Institute of Further Technical Education, Malaysia.

With over three decades of experience in the property development and construction industries, Tan Sri Datuk Seri Gan brings a wealth of expertise to his leadership roles. To date, Tan Sri Datuk Seri Gan has built a distinguished track record, having overseen the completion of more than 30 property development projects as he continues to actively

shape the landscape of the property development industry.

Tan Sri Datuk Seri Gan's career began at Unigreen Hardware Supplies, a building materials trading business co-owned by his family, where he served as a business partner. His tenure there saw him progress from overseeing sales, to taking the helm of the company's overall operations.

Building upon this foundation, Tan Sri Datuk Seri Gan transitioned to property development with the successful completion of Pelangi Condominium in Kuala Lumpur in 2002, a project carried out by Inner Glamour Sdn. Bhd. This accomplishment laid the groundwork for the establishment of the Platinum Victory Group ("Platinum Victory"), Tan Sri Datuk Seri Gan's flagship company, which has since flourished under his guidance. Platinum Victory's portfolio boasts numerous prosperous developments, including the Platinum Hill condominium series in Taman Melati Utama, the Platinum Lake condominium series in Danau Kota Setapak, and the Platinum Suites series on Jalan Sultan Ismail in Kuala Lumpur, all executed under the entities of Platinum Victory Sdn. Bhd., Platinum Victory Development Sdn. Bhd., and Platinum Victory Property Sdn. Bhd., respectively.

In 2010, Tan Sri Datuk Seri Gan expanded his business interests by venturing into construction, drawing upon his extensive experience and knowledge in construction and

project management. This led to the founding of Southern Score to capitalise on demand for construction services mainly for high-rise residential buildings.

Under Tan Sri Datuk Seri Gan's leadership, Southern Score actively pursued opportunities in both public and private sector construction projects, culminating in the successful award of its inaugural project, the PR1MA Jalan Jubilee project by PR1MA Corporation Berhad in 2015.

Tan Sri Datuk Seri Gan does not hold any directorship in other public or listed companies.

Tan Sri Datuk Seri Gan is the father of Gan Yee Hin, the Chief Executive Officer & Executive Director and the major shareholder of SSBB via his direct interest in Super Advantage Property Sdn. Bhd., a major shareholder of SSBB. Save for the above, he does not have any family relationship with any directors and/or major shareholder of SSBB nor any conflicts of interest/potential conflicts of interest in any business arrangement involving the Company. He has not been convicted of any offences (excluding traffic offences, if any) within the past five (5) years and has not faced any public sanctions or penalties from relevant regulatory bodies during the financial year under review.

MANAGEMENT

DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS

# OPERATIONAL & BUSINESS OVERVIEW

The construction industry continued to play a pivotal role in driving our country's economic growth, contributing significantly to the country's gross domestic product ("GDP"). Over the past year, the sector saw healthy expansion, particularly in civil engineering and residential projects, spurred by both public infrastructure initiatives and private sector investments despite facing challenges such as high interest rates and a rising cost environment.

According to the Department of Statistics Malaysia, the value of construction work done rose  $8.0\%$  year-on-year ("YoY") to RM67.5 billion in the second half of 2023, before increasing further to RM75.7 billion in the first half of 2024. The expansion was primarily driven by activities across civil engineering, non-residential and residential sub-sectors.

During the year under review, we observed property developers are gradually launching or planning to launch new residential projects amid the improving domestic economy. This resurgence in activity reflects growing confidence in the market, supported by increased consumer demand and more favourable financing conditions.

On the flip side, however, building material costs in Malaysia remained elevated in FYE 2024 due to a combination of supply chain issues and inflationary pressures. Despite these challenges, the Group stayed agile, adapting by optimising the selection of subcontractors and suppliers, leveraging bulk purchasing, and ensuring tight budget controls. This approach allowed us to manage the impact of rising costs and sustain efficiency while keeping projects on schedule.

# PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS

# Completed Project in FYE 2024:

During the year, we successfully completed the Vista Sentul Residences project which had a contract value of RM148.6 million. Located at Jalan Sentul, Vista Sentul Residences comprises 705 units of apartments across two towers (24- and 37-storey) along with an 8-storey car park. The on-time completion of this project further demonstrated our expertise in construction management and contributed to the Group's revenue growth. We take pride in our unwavering commitment to timely and efficient project execution, which continues to solidify our reputation for excellence in the industry.

Vista Sentul Residences

# New Project Secured in FYE 2024:

We are delighted to share that in February 2024, we secured our single largest contract to-date, valued at RM618.2 million, for the main building works of the PV 22 Residences located in Setapak, Kuala Lumpur.

The project essentially entails the construction of two 47-floor residential apartment blocks with a combined 2,082 units, 55 units of commercial space, a hawker area, kindergarten, management office, prayer room, TNB switching station, mechanical rooms, a 6-level car park podium, a resident facility level as well as a basement level with car park and mechanical room.

Works for the project commenced in March 2024 and is slated for completion in August 2028. This win not only strengthens our project pipeline but also provides clear earnings visibility for the next 4 years. Note that SSBB also undertook the site clearance, piling, pile cap, stump and sub-structure ("sub-structure") works for PV 22 Residences in an earlier contract awarded in February 2023 valued at RM135.3 million. As of 30 June 2024, sub-structure works were  $64\%$  completed, while main building works were  $3\%$  completed.

DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS

# STRATEGIC PROPOSED ACQUISITION: EXPANDING M&E ENGINEERING CAPABILITIES

As part of our growth strategy and value creation to our shareholders, SSBB has obtained its shareholders' approval at an EGM held on 30 August 2024 to acquire a  $51\%$  -stake in SJEE for a cash consideration of RM22.95 million from Ir. Ngo Hea Bing ("Vendor"). Post-completion, the Vendor will continue to hold  $49.0\%$  stake and will continue growing the business ("Proposed Acquisition").

This is a strategic move for us, aimed at expanding our offerings to include mechanical and electrical ("M&E") services as well as enhancing market reach beyond high-rise residential buildings and civil infrastructure. The Proposed Acquisition was priced at 9 times Price/Earnings ("PE") multiples based on profit guarantee provided by SJEE whereby SJEE shall achieve a cumulative profit after tax of not less than RM15.00 million over 3 financial years ("Profit Guarantee").

The Group had obtained shareholders' approval for the Proposed Acquisition at the EGM held on 30 August 2024. The Proposed Acquisition is expected to be completed by end-2024.

Established in 1992, SJEE specialises in the design, installation, and commissioning of electrical works, with a particular focus on high-tech industries and data centres. Beyond data centres, SJEE's portfolio includes successful M&E projects across diverse sectors such as high-rise buildings, commercial and industrial facilities, and healthcare institutions.

Over the past 10 years, SJEE has completed over RM500.0 million worth of projects across Malaysia, serving clientele across various industries, including software, cloud computing, technology, oil and gas, electronics, financial services, and healthcare. This strategic Proposed Acquisition not only enhances our capabilities but also unlocks new and lucrative opportunities for the Group. SJEE's established client base and project experience will significantly broaden our market reach.

The Proposed Acquisition will position us to capitalise on the burgeoning data centre market in Malaysia. SJEE has completed six data centre jobs to-date, including for a global multinational technology corporation. Upon completion of the Proposed Acquisition, SJEE's specialised skills and experience in high-tech and data centre electrical works will equip us to meet the surging demand for these facilities, driven by rapid digitalisation and cloud adoption. This expansion into the data centre sector aligns seamlessly with our vision for future growth and shareholder value creation.

SSBB is forging ahead into FYE 2025 with optimism, backed by our twin engines of growth - progressive growth in the construction management services as well as expected expansion in its M&E division. With this and barring any unforeseen circumstances, the Group is optimistic about its future prospects moving forward.

MANAGEMENT

DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS

# FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE REVIEW

# Revenue

In FYE 2024, SSBB reported revenue of RM170.7 million, driven primarily by the progress billings for the ongoing projects - Vista Harmoni Sentul Residences, Berlian Setapak 2 Residences, PV 22 Residences substructure works, as well as commencement of main building works for the PV 22 Residences project.

# Profitability

The Group registered a Gross Profit ("GP") of RM49.0 million in FYE 2024 against the revenue of RM170.7 million, rendering a GP margin of  $28.7\%$ . Meanwhile, PBT stood at RM41.5 million, with a net profit of RM31.5 million, reflecting a PBT margin of  $24.3\%$  and a net profit margin of  $18.4\%$ .

We attribute our healthy profit margin profiles to our asset-light model with low depreciation charges, as well as cost efficiencies derived from lower overhead cost, reduced risk exposure and flexibility in operational scalability.

There are no YoY comparative figures as the previous financial period covered only six months period due to a change in the financial year-end of Southern Score from 31 December to 30 June. As a result, the audited financial statements for FPE 2023 reflect the shorter period from 1 January 2023 to 30 June 2023 ("FPE 2023").

# Capital Structure and Resources

As of 30 June 2024, SSBB's total assets increased  $20.6\%$  YoY to RM238.2 million from a year ago, primarily attributed to higher trade receivables, which stood at RM143.3 million at the end of FYE 2024, compared to RM88.4 million in the prior year. This was in tandem with higher progress billings undertaken during the year under review.

The larger revenue base also resulted in total liabilities rising to RM80.5 million at the end of FYE 2024 from RM48.5 million a year ago. This was attributable to an increase in trade payables and total borrowings to support ongoing project developments.

On balance, the Group has maintained a strong financial position. Total cash holdings, including deposits and short-term placements, stood at RM67.8 million, significantly exceeding the Group's total borrowings of RM14.6 million for FYE 2024. This healthy cash position provided the Group with great financial flexibility as well as a buffer for any contingencies.

Meanwhile, SSBB's total equity reached RM157.7 million as at 30 June 2024, representing a  $5.9\%$  increase from RM149.0 million in the previous year on higher retained earnings. This growth in total equity further strengthened the Group's financial foundation and demonstrated our ability to generate value for shareholders.

# Net Gearing, Net Cash Per Share & Net Operating Cash Flow ("NOCF")

The Group has maintained a net cash position with a net cash per share of 2.3 sen as at 30 June 2024. Additionally, the Group also reported a positive NOCF of RM1.4 million for the year.

# ANTICIPATED OR KNOWN RISKS

# Market Risk

The global and Malaysian economies may face potential slowdowns, which could dampen demand for construction services.

DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS

# FORGING AHEAD

The World Economic Outlook ("WEO") projects a stable global growth rate of  $3.2\%$  in 2024 and  $3.3\%$  in 2025, fuelled by resilience in advanced economies and a gradual recovery in emerging markets. The recent interest rate cut in September 2024 by the Federal Reserve in the United States ("US") is expected to boost global market confidence, spurring investment and consumer spending.

Back in Malaysia, the GDP growth is now projected to expand between  $4.8\%$  to  $5.3\%$ , an upward revision from  $4.0\%$  to  $5.0\%$  previously according to Budget 2025. This optimistic forecast is driven by strong domestic demand and a revitalised services sector. The healthy  $5.9\%$  GDP growth in the second quarter of 2024 further supports this positive outlook.

Zooming into the domestic construction industry, it is poised for growth in the second half of 2024 and beyond, catalysed by major infrastructure initiatives such as the Penang Light Rail Transit ("LRT") and Mass Rapid Transit 3 ("MRT3"), as well as ongoing projects including the East Coast Rail Link ("ECRL") and Pan Borneo Highway. Additionally, increasing demand for industrial facilities such as warehouses, data centres, and semiconductor plants will contribute to this expansion too. These developments are anticipated to generate substantial job opportunities and bolster economic growth.

At SSBB, our construction business development team is actively pursuing for more projects in the high-rise building and infrastructure sub-sectors, while being mindful to select tenders that align with our strategic priorities.

On that note, we are pleased to share we have been awarded a turnkey contract in July 2024 for the proposed development of residential apartments in Mukim Setapak from Smart Advance Resources Sdn Bhd. The project entails the construction of 3 blocks with an aggregate of 794 apartment units, along with 1 facility floor, 8 floors of podium car park, 1 guard house and 1 Tenaga Nasional Berhad 11kV substation.

With this latest contract win, we now have 7 ongoing projects, providing clear earnings visibility for the next 3 to 4 years. The Group remains committed to delivering projects on time while ensuring uncompromising quality standards.

On the other hand, we are excited about prospects of SJEE as it is poised to benefit from the data centre boom in Malaysia. According to Digital News Asia who quoted Juwai IQI co-Founder and Group CEO Kashif Ansari, Malaysia is Southeast Asia's fastest growing data centre market owing to our strategic location, favourable government policies, proximity to Singapore, and attractively priced land, power, and water. It is understood that the data centre market development pipeline consists of 1.2 GW, which represents  $600\%$  growth over the next five years.

Major cloud service providers such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Google have all made announcements of their respective intentions to build data centres in Malaysia. Other names who are planning to similarly set up data centres here are AirTrunk, Yondr Group, Princeton Digital Group, AIMS Group, EdgeConneX and Sea Ltd., to name a few. A separate article by the Malaysian Investment Development Authority ("MIDA") highlighted that data centre projects are estimated to reach at least 4.7 GW over the next 10 years in Malaysia.

# Optimising Energy Efficiency

Our operations rely on electricity, which powers our existing operational locations, including two construction sites, a project office, and our headquarters. Apart from electricity, we also utilise diesel for machinery, and petrol for company vehicles.

Cognisant of the environmental impact from energy usage, we leverage smart technologies to optimise energy consumption in our buildings. In our buildings, we incorporate automated lighting systems that respond to usage patterns, along with energy-efficient features like light-emitting diode ("LED") lighting, leading to lower greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions.

Furthermore, we embrace renewable energy sources such as solar power to further decrease our reliance on fossil fuels. In addition, we prioritise advanced insulation to curtail heat transfer, leading to lower energy consumption for cooling.

![](images/26a9136c97283d2951c6c59ba216a10d28c831b3314971c4cccf3f96a579bba9.jpg)

# Enhancing Operational Efficiencies

At the same time, we are enhancing operational efficiencies to further lower the Group's environmental impact. This includes optimising construction schedules to reduce equipment idle time, minimising fuel consumption and GHG emissions.

To manage fuel usage more effectively, we install meters on diesel tanks at construction sites. These meters provide insights into fuel consumption and equipment usage, allowing us to implement targeted measures to improve fuel efficiency and lower emissions.

# OUR PROGRESS

In FYE 2024, SSBB Group consumed a total of 452,035 kilowatt-hours ("kWh") of electricity. The increase is primarily attributed to higher site progress and change in our financial year-end, which resulted in the previous FPE 2023 only covering six months of usage, while FYE 2024 reflects a full 12-month consumption.

During the year, the Group consumed 110,098 litres of diesel, mainly for machinery and equipment usage at project sites. Meanwhile, petrol consumption decreased to 579 litres following reduced travel requirements.

# WASTE AND MATERIALS MANAGEMENT

# WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?

The construction industry generates a significant amount of waste, which can contribute to pollution, resource depletion, and health and safety risks. With this in mind, we prioritise responsible waste and materials management in minimising our projects' overall environmental footprint. This approach mitigates operational risks, conserves resources, and lowers landfill use and emissions, benefitting the environment, our company, as well as our clients.

# OUR APPROACH

At SSBB Group, we adopt a multi-pronged approach to waste and materials management, as we seek to minimise waste generation and maximise resource efficiency throughout the lifecycle of our projects - from material procurement to final completion. Our commitment is demonstrated through our implementation of the 3R concept.

![](images/7a3eb8dd1ff2e5148f43ca033e5b0a0e43eb3e6f3de54d3a35b9050a7f9817b9.jpg)

RECYCLE

# Reduce:

Our approach begins with a focus on reducing waste at its source. We opt for sustainable and recycled construction materials whenever feasible. Our top five most-used materials are ready-mix concrete, cement, sand, steel products, and plywood. We carefully manage these resources to lower our environmental footprint, while upholding the quality of our projects.

We also explore innovative material alternatives to further reduce waste generation. One such initiative involves substituting Ordinary Portland Cement ("OPC") with Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag ("GGBS") in our ready-mix concrete, which enhances the concrete's durability and strength, while reducing the energy required for production. Furthermore, we utilise durable aluminium or metal formwork, which have a longer lifespan and require less frequent replacement compared to traditional materials, such as timber and steel. This leads to a reduction in waste generated from formwork materials over time.

Besides that, we leverage specialised software like BIM and IBS to lessen material wastage and optimise resource utilisation, further contributing to waste reduction on our projects.

At construction sites, we prioritise precision and efficiency as we employ practices such as using cut-to-size rebar and BRC. The cut-to-size rebar ensures the

steel reinforcement bars are precisely measured and cut to the required lengths, reducing excess material and waste. Meanwhile, the BRC involves prefabricated steel mesh reinforcement, which not only enhances structural integrity but also reduces the amount of on-site cutting and trimming.

At our office premises, we encourage employees to rely on digital documents whenever possible. This practice minimises paper use and lessens energy consumption associated with printing and storing document.

![](images/20658fe21de20911f1faeaadc858b8f01b991d3b132e0019124e50eab8f208c1.jpg)

# Reuse:

We seek opportunities to reuse materials and limit waste in our operations. One of our practices is the reuse of plywood and other formwork materials in our projects. By disassembling and reusing these materials, we extend their lifespan and reduce the need for new resources. This approach promotes a circular economy, where materials are given new life at the end of their useful life without harmful environmental effects.

# Recycle:

We promote a culture of recycling within our organisation. Through ongoing waste recycling programmes, we aim to raise employee awareness about the importance of recycling. To facilitate responsible waste management, we provide designated recycling bins at our office for the collection of various recyclable materials. These include wastes such as paper, envelopes, cardboard, metals, plastic and glass bottles, to name a few.

For waste that cannot be reduced, reused, or recycled, we ensure responsible disposal. At our construction sites, we segregate waste into distinct categories, primarily construction waste or domestic waste. Construction waste encompasses materials like concrete, wood, metals, and packaging materials, while domestic waste mainly consists of food scraps.

We engage waste contractors licensed by the Department of Environment ("DOE") to handle "Construction Waste" and "Commercial and Industrial Waste". This enables us to dispose of all waste generated from our operations responsibly and in compliance with environmental regulations.

# OUR PROGRESS

In FYE 2024, we maintained compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including the Environmental Quality (Scheduled Wastes) Regulations 2005.

# WATER MANAGEMENT

# WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?

Water is a finite yet crucial resource for the construction sector. As a construction management company, we are mindful of the industry's impact on water availability and embrace our roles as responsible stewards. Through responsible water management, we strive to minimise our environmental footprint, lower costs, and preserve the continued availability of this vital resource.

# OUR APPROACH

SSBB Group practices water stewardship through responsible planning and equitable water use. Our offices and construction sites primarily draw water from the municipal water supply. We manage our water usage through monitoring and data collection from water meter readings. This enables us to identify and implement measures to minimise water wastage.

A critical aspect of our water management strategy is stormwater management, ensuring we protect water quality and prevent any negative impacts on the environment and the community. As part of our initiatives, we strategically install and maintain silt traps at our construction sites. These structures act as barriers, capturing sediment and other pollutants carried by stormwater runoff, preventing them from entering natural water bodies. We also install filters, such as aggregate-wrapped geotextile filters, at silt trap outlets to filter out sediment and protect water quality. Moreover, slope areas are covered with geotextile fabric to prevent erosion.

Our commitment to water stewardship is ongoing. We continually seek ways to further enhance our water efficiency.

# OUR PROGRESS

During the year under review, SSBB Group's operations consumed 16,977 cubic metres ("m³") of water, reflecting water usage for a full 12-month period, as compared to the 6-month period under FPE 2023.

# SOCIAL

# LABOUR PRACTICES AND HUMAN RIGHTS

# WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?

Our employees' well-being and performance are crucial to the Group's success and sustainability. Upholding human rights and fair labour practices is not just a moral imperative, but also essential to building stakeholder trust. This fosters employee satisfaction and productivity, ultimately leading to improved project outcomes. Moreover, by having this ethical foundation, we mitigate risks and strengthen the Group's reputation. Prioritising human rights is an investment in our Group, our clients, and our shared future.

# OUR APPROACH

Our Employee Handbook provides clear guidance on SSBB Group's policies, procedures, and expectations. It serves as a roadmap for the Group's practices and ensures compliance with applicable laws and regulations pertaining to human rights and fair labour practices. The handbook covers a wide range of topics crucial to maintaining an equitable workplace, including nondiscrimination, fair wages and benefits, and safe working conditions, to name a few.

A copy of the handbook is provided to each new hire upon onboarding. This facilitates all employees becoming well-acquainted with the Group's policies and procedures that guide their roles and responsibilities, as well as the entitlements and benefits they are entitled to.

In addition to the Employee Handbook, we have implemented an Employee Code of Conduct, outlining the ethical and professional standards we expect from every member of our team.

The Group's Workplace Harassment Prevention Policy further solidifies our dedication to a safe and inclusive environment. It enforces a zero-tolerance stance against any conduct that creates a hostile or offensive atmosphere.

Ultimately, all SSBB Group's employees are required to sign and acknowledge the Employee Handbook, Employee Code of Conduct, and Workplace Harassment Prevention Policy to confirm their understanding and compliance.

# OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH

# WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?

In the construction industry, prioritising occupational safety and health ("OSH") is paramount. The Group's employees and contractors face inherent risks daily on project sites, from working at heights to operating heavy machinery. By maintaining a safe and healthy environment, we fulfil our obligations to protect our workforce, while ensuring operational efficiency and timely project delivery. A strong safety culture reduces accidents and injuries, prevents costly delays, and preserves employee well-being, ultimately contributing to a more sustainable business.

# OUR APPROACH

We have implemented a Safety, Health & Environment ("SHE") Policy at Southern Score. This policy serves as the foundation of the Group's pledge to maintain a safe and healthy working environment for all employees and stakeholders. As outlined in the policy, we adopt a proactive and preventive approach to OSH, requiring the cooperation of all our people.

We are committed to complying with all relevant safety laws and regulations as well as achieving a hazard-free workplace. To facilitate this, we have established two key bodies:

- Safety & Health Team: Led by a Safety Officer, this team takes a strategic approach, responsible for developing and implementing safety policies, programmes and procedures at project sites.  
- OSH Committee: We have a dedicated OSH Committee at each project site, with representatives from both employer and employee sides.

These committees focus on practical, on-site implementation of safety measures. They work closely with the Safety & Health Department to monitor safety practices, conduct regular site-specific risk assessments, and investigate incidents at respective locations.

![](images/4710d7b4ca770833060a67c6d0e204588fa36ce70d2499ee57016ab214161008.jpg)

This collaborative approach is crucial to effectively managing health and safety risks at Southern Score's project sites. At our construction sites, we have in place clear health and safety protocols for all individuals to adhere to. We recognise that the active participation and cooperation of all team members are essential, and we are committed to providing the necessary resources and support to promote everyone's safety and well-being.

We believe that a strong safety culture is built on communication, education, and shared responsibility. To promote this, we have implemented several initiatives including:

- Weekly Tool-Box Talk: These regular meetings provide a platform for open dialogue about safety concerns, recent incidents, and best practices.  
- Site Safety Campaign: This ongoing campaign focuses on specific safety risks or areas of improvement, using engaging and informative materials to raise awareness and promote safe behaviours.  
Monthly committee meetings: These meetings provide a forum for in-depth discussions, ensuring safety concerns are addressed promptly and effectively by the OSH Committees.

Meanwhile, for new development projects, we leverage technology and meticulous planning to strengthen safety. We integrate BIM to conduct virtual audits of our construction plans, enabling us to identify potential safety hazards early in the design phase. Besides that, the use of IBS further improves safety by streamlining construction processes. We also develop Health, Safety and Environment ("HSE") plans outlining safety protocols, and emergency response procedures at each site.

# OUR PROGRESS

In FYE 2024, SSBB Group complied with relevant local OSH laws, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act 1994 ("OSHA 1994"), Construction Industry Development Board Act 520 ("CIDB Act 520") and the Occupational Health (Amendment) Act 2022.

Our dedication to safety has been recognised with the Safety and Health Assessment System in Construction ("SHASSIC") certification for our Vista Sentul Residences Kuala Lumpur project. This certification highlights our high level of commitment to safety and health management.

# PRODUCT QUALITY AND RESPONSIBILITY

# WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?

At SSBB Group, we understand that every project impacts lives and the environment, which underlines the importance of quality and accountability in our endeavours. We prioritise sustainable practices and superior materials, ensuring high workmanship, along with the safety and durability of our buildings. This commitment cultivates client trust and enhances the Group's reputation, while minimising our ecological footprint.

# OUR APPROACH

Our pursuit of excellence is underpinned by our Quality Management System ("GMS") that is ISO 9001:2015 certified, which drives continuous improvement through regular feedback and evaluation. We also maintain strict adherence to industry standards and regulations.

Furthermore, the Group's CIDB G7 contractor status underscores our capabilities and experience in undertaking large and complex projects.

Our firm commitment to quality is reinforced through regular site inspections and supervision. We benchmark against industry standards and utilise the Quality Assessment System in Construction ("QLASSIC") Assessment based on the Construction Industry Standard (CIS 7:2014), to objectively measure and evaluate the quality of workmanship. QLASSIC ensures that our projects consistently meet or exceed industry benchmarks.

Furthermore, we embrace the GreenRE standards to promote environmentally sustainable construction practices. By adhering to GreenRE standards, we demonstrate our resolute to minimising the environmental impact of our projects.

# Leveraging Technology

We harness technology and implement advanced construction techniques, such as BIM and IBS, to optimise design and construction processes.

We employ BIM to visualise and optimise projects in the pre-construction phase, ensuring efficient resource allocation and minimising errors. BIM also allows for detailed planning, leading to time and cost savings.

Meanwhile, IBS is integral to our construction solutions as we integrate IBS technology into every project. IBS is a core part of our projects, improving productivity, and reducing construction errors. Furthermore, we are exploring the integration of automation and robotics into IBS processes, potentially further streamlining construction.

# OUR PROGRESS

Our completed projects serve as a testament to our dedication to quality. We offer comprehensive design and construction services for residential, commercial, and specialised buildings, evident in successful projects like Vista Sentul Residences, PV9 Residences, Platinum Arena Residences, and PR1MA Jalan Jubilee Residences.

We have achieved QLASSIC scores exceeding  $75\%$  for our completed projects, highlighting the build quality we uphold.

# COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT

# WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?

As a responsible corporate citizen, we believe our success is intertwined with the well-being of those around us. Therefore, we seek to make a positive social impact through Corporate Social Responsibility ("CSR") initiatives that align with our values. Through community engagement and investment, we aim to build lasting relationships with the communities we serve, leaving a positive legacy beyond the completion of our projects.

# OUR APPROACH

Our approach to community engagement is rooted in a deep sense of responsibility. We believe in supporting established charitable organisations that share our values and are dedicated to uplifting the lives of those in need.

Beyond financial contributions, we also invest in the future of our community. We provide internship opportunities for undergraduates, nurturing future talent. At the same time, we prioritise hiring local employees and partnering with local vendors, recognising the importance of contributing to the economic well-being of the communities where we operate. By creating job opportunities and supporting local businesses, we aim to stimulate economic growth and create a more vibrant and sustainable community.

# OUR PROGRESS

For the year under review, we made a total contribution of RM15,800 to various charitable causes and community initiatives.

This included a contribution to Persatuan Pencinta Hak Asasi Haiwan in Ulu Langat in support of their efforts in animal rescue, rehabilitation, and advocacy. We have also made a donation to Tabung Kebajikan Majlis Kebajikan & Sukan Anggota-Anggota Kerajaan Wilayah Persekutuan ("MAKSWIP") for their Kejohanan Golf Amal Perpaduan community project. Furthermore, we have channeled funds to our banking partner's CSR initiatives during the year.

In FYE 2024, our workforce comprises  $100\%$  local employees, and  $100\%$  of our vendors are locals. These initiatives highlight our dedication to giving back to the community and supporting causes that align with our values.

# GOVERNANCE

# GOVERNANCE AND ANTI-CORRUPTION

# WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?

The Group acknowledges that our success is linked to a foundation of strong governance and ethical principles, crucial for navigating the dynamic landscape of the construction industry. By upholding these values, we minimise risks associated with fraud, corruption, and other unethical business practices. This cultivates a culture of transparency and accountability, which in turn reinforces the confidence of our stakeholders in the Group.

# OUR APPROACH

Our approach to governance emphasises integrity, transparency and accountability. We achieve this through clear policies and procedures designed to identify and address potential ethical concerns.

![](images/d34ace5bd104fc53731e20aa0a73e32c349126ae85411c17d46b24f1c9012e0e.jpg)

The Group's governance framework is built upon a set of policies that provide clear guidelines on ethical conduct, anti-corruption, and other critical areas. These policies, some of which are available on SSBB Group's corporate website at www.southernscore.com.my, ensure that our business practices remain lawful and ethically sound.

To reinforce these policies, we invest in training programmes, equipping our management and executive-level employees with the knowledge and tools to uphold ethical standards, particularly in areas such as tender submission, procurement, and quality assurance. Apart from that, our Whistle-Blowing Policy allows concerns about potential unethical practices to be raised without fear of reprisal. This facilitates the prompt identification and resolution of issues, maintaining the highest levels of integrity throughout our operations.

SUSTAINABILITY

STATEMENT

# Anti-Corruption

We adhere to a strict zero-tolerance policy towards all forms of bribery and corruption. This stance is currently formalised within the Group's Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy ("ABC Policy"). This policy applies to all employees, directors, and third parties acting on behalf of the Group.

The ABC Policy outlines our firm commitment to preventing all acts of bribery and corruption in accordance with Section 17A of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission ("MACC") Act 2009. Our Integrity Committee oversees the implementation and enforcement of the ABC Policy to uphold its effectiveness.

In order to embed these principles within our Group, all employees including new hires, are required to certify in writing, via the Employee Declaration Form, that they have understood and will abide by the ABC Policy. We extend this expectation to our business partners, requiring them to complete a Business Partner Declaration Form, affirming their pledge to lawful business practices and anti-corruption principles. By doing so, we ascertain our business transactions are conducted with utmost integrity, contributing to a more equitable business environment.

# Whistleblowing Policy and Procedures

The Group's Whistleblowing Policy provides a safe and confidential channel for internal or external stakeholders to report potential misconduct or concerns. The policy outlines the reporting procedure, emphasising confidentiality and protection from retaliation for whistleblowers. It also details the investigation process and our commitment to taking appropriate action to address any substantiated misconduct. The Audit and Risk Management Committee ("ARMC") is responsible for conducting periodic reviews of the Whistleblowing Policy.

# Whistleblowing Procedures

# Report Concerns

Individuals can report concerns or suspicions of misconduct by submitting a written disclosure via the Whistleblower Form, enclosed in the policy and on the corporate website.

The form should be e-mailed to the chairperson of the ARMC at humanresource@southernscore.com.

# Investigation

The Chairperson of the ARMC will screen and assess the whistleblower's disclosure to determine if it constitutes an improper conduct.

The Human Resources Department ("HRD") will conduct an initial investigation and report preliminary findings to the Chairperson.

# Feedback

The whistleblower is informed about the progress and outcome of the investigation, maintaining confidentiality and integrity. The notification letter will be signed off by the Chairperson of the ARMC.

# Action

Appropriate action is taken if the investigation confirms the misconduct. This may include disciplinary measures, corrective actions, or other remedies as deemed necessary, based on our Human Resources guidelines and procedures.

# SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT

# WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?

As a construction management services provider, effective supply chain management is at the core of our operations. It is critical to secure the right resources at the right time and cost. Beyond operational efficiency, responsible sourcing is vital for driving sustainability across our projects and the wider industry. We also emphasise local procurement to optimise costs, reduce our carbon footprint, and support the communities where we work.

# OUR APPROACH

SSBB Group engages with a wide network of suppliers to access the resources and necessary expertise for our operations. We procure a wide range of services and products, including building materials.

![](images/2dd24fe5f6bdf22a8941c6b888fecd8f6fd272faf2560b9b269eb1ae97d49ae8.jpg)

Our partnerships are forged through open collaboration, innovation, and proactive problem-solving. During the tendering process, potential vendors are thoroughly evaluated against a set of criteria to ensure they meet our standards and contribute to successful projects.

We also seek suppliers and subcontractors who share our commitment to sustainability, allowing the Group to reduce costs through economies of scale and shared expertise while promoting environmentally responsible practices.

Business partners are required to formally acknowledge their understanding of and adherence to the ABC Policy. This ensures we deal with ethical and reputable suppliers and contractors.

We prioritise sourcing from local suppliers, whenever feasible. Local contractors are given priority as we opt to source for local products, materials, and services whenever possible. This not only assures quality and reliability, but also generates a positive socio-economic impact in our communities, supporting job creation and economic growth.

# OUR PROGRESS

In FYE 2024, we maintained a  $100\%$  local supplier base with  $100\%$  of our procurement spending directed towards them as well.

# DATA PRIVACY AND SECURITY

# WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?

In today's digital age, data protection is paramount. In our course of business, we handle sensitive information from various stakeholders. Our IT division manages a large amount of data, making us vulnerable to cyber threats. A breach of our cyber defences could lead to operational disruptions, financial losses, reputational damage, as well as potential legal and regulatory consequences. Therefore, protecting sensitive information is crucial to maintaining stakeholder trust and ensuring business continuity.

# OUR APPROACH

Recognising our responsibility to uphold data integrity, we have implemented data protection measures to safeguard stakeholder information. We have implemented an IT Policy, outlining our procedures to protect personal and sensitive information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

These procedures are complemented by the robust security protocols, regular audits, and employee training enshrined in the Group's Privacy Policy. The policy is fully compliant with the Personal Data Protection Act 2010 ("PDPA"), ensuring data security and legal compliance.

# OUR PROGRESS

As a result of our data protection measures and adherence to privacy protocols, we recorded zero (0) cases of breaches of customers' data and zero (0) substantiated complaints concerning breaches of customer privacy or data misuse in FYE 2024.

To this end, the Board has the overall responsibility for reviewing and adopting the strategic plans, overseeing the Group's business, implementing an appropriate system of risk management and ensuring the adequacy and integrity of the Company's system of internal control.

The Board also has a crucial role in establishing a proper ethical framework within the organisation. It is entrusted with the task of effectively and ethically leading and managing the Group. Each Director is legally obligated to act in the Group's best interests, ultimately aiming to enhance shareholders' value. The directors, both collectively and individually, are fully aware of their responsibilities towards stakeholders in managing the Group's affairs.

Detailed information about these responsibilities can be found in the Board Charter & Code of Conduct, which is accessible on the Company's website at www.southernscore.com.my.

The corporate governance of the Group comprises a framework of structures, policies and procedures. The Board is supported by two (2) Board Committees, i.e. the Audit and Risk Management Committee and the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.

These committees are actively involved and serve as oversight bodies. They assess and make recommendations on matters falling within their respective areas of responsibility for the Board's consideration and approval. The Board is also kept informed by the respective Chairman of these committees about the discussions and deliberations that occur during their meetings.

The Board conveys its directives to the Management through the Managing Director ("MD"), who is responsible for implementing these directives. Management, in turn, is accountable for the day-to-day administration of the Group, operating within the powers delegated by the Board and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

Additionally, it outlines the operational practices of the Board.

The Board Charter lists out matters that are reserved for the Board supported by any recommendation as may be made from time to time by the Board Committees (as appropriate).

# PRINCIPLE A: BOARD LEADERSHIP AND EFFECTIVENESS (CONT'D)

# II. BOARD COMPOSITION

# 1. Composition and Diversity

The Board recognises the value of a diverse and inclusive composition, believing that it harnesses the unique strengths of its members to effectively steer the Company and maintain its competitive edge. To ensure this, the Board, through its NRC, conducts an annual review of its size and composition. This evaluation aims to confirm that the Board possesses the appropriate size, diversity, and independence to align with the Company's objectives and strategic goals.

The Board consists of one (1) Non-Independent Non-Executive Chairman, one (1) Non-Independent Non-Executive Director, two (2) Independent Non-Executive Directors and three (3) Executive Directors. This complies with Paragraph 15.02(1) of the AMLR which requires at least two (2) Directors or one-third (1/3) of the board to be Independent Directors. In the event of any vacancy in the Board of Directors resulting in noncompliance with Para 15.02(1) of the AMLR, the Company must fill the vacancy within 3 months. A brief profile of each Director is presented in pages 8 to 14 of this Annual Report.

The Directors bring a wealth of diverse knowledge, skills, and competencies to the Board, enabling them to make active, informed, and positive contributions to the Group's management, business operations, and strategic development. The appointments of both the Board and Senior Management are based on objective criteria, merit, and a commitment to diversity, encompassing skills, experience, age, cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds, and gender.

While the Board acknowledges the importance of promoting gender diversity and aims to increase female representation in both the Board and Senior Management in the future, it has chosen not to establish specific targets. The focus remains on having the right mix of skills and competencies rather than merely percentages. Currently, there are two (2) women serving on the Board, representing approximately  $28.6\%$  of female representation.

Diversity at the Senior Management level fosters constructive debates and leads to better decision-making, particularly in today's rapidly changing environment. The Board values the diversity of perspectives and experiences at the Senior Management level, recognising the advantages it brings to decision-making and competitiveness.

With a moderately sized Board, it incorporates a mix of entrepreneurship, business acumen and professional expertise across various domains, including business and risk management, finance (including audit, tax, accounting and legal), and the technical aspects relevant to the Group's industries. The collective business, management, and professional experience, along with knowledge and expertise, possessed by Board members, provides the essential competencies necessary for diverse and objective perspectives on the Group's business and strategic direction.

The Board Diversity Policy is included in the Board Charter of the Company and is available for reference on the Group's website at www.southernscore.com.my.

# 2. Independence

The Board places great importance on having Directors who are not only capable and willing to make decisions in the best interest of shareholders but also free from any conflicts of interest. These Directors are expected to be independent of Management, which means they should be able to carry out their duties and express their views without any hindrance caused by personal relationships or business ties.

Presently, the Board has two (2) Independent Non-Executive Directors, namely Ms. Phe Kheng Peng and Ms. Too Siew Mooi. Neither of them holds any shares in the company nor are they employed by the Group. Furthermore, they do not have any relationships that could potentially influence their impartial judgment.

# PRINCIPLE A: BOARD LEADERSHIP AND EFFECTIVENESS (CONT'D)

# II. BOARD COMPOSITION (CONT'D)

# 2. Independence (Cont'd)

Consistent with the guidelines established by the Code and the Board Charter, the tenure of an Independent Non-Executive Director should not exceed a cumulative term of nine (9) years. Once this nine-year period is reached, an Independent Director may continue to serve on the Board. However, the Board is required to provide justification, and subject to obtaining approval from shareholders, it may retain him/her as an Independent Non-Executive Director who has served for nine years or more. As of the date of this statement, none of the Independent Non-Executive Directors has completed nine (9) years of service since their appointment.

The Board conducts an annual assessment of the independence of Independent Non-Executive Directors as part of the annual Board assessment process. This assessment is conducted based on the criteria set by Bursa Securities. The Board is content with the level of independence demonstrated by all Independent Non-Executive Directors.

# 3. Board Appointments and Re-election of Directors

The NRC is responsible to recommend candidates to the Board to fill vacancies arising from resignation, retirement or other reasons or if there is a need to appoint additional Directors with the required skills of profession to the Board to meet any competency gaps identified by the NRC. The potential candidates may be proposed by existing Directors, Senior Management, shareholders or third-party referrals.

Upon receipt of the proposal, the NRC is responsible to conduct an assessment and evaluation on the proposed candidates.

The assessment and evaluation on the proposed candidates and the re-election of retiring Directors include, among others:-

(a) the composition requirements for the Board and Board Committees;  
(b) the candidate's age, education background, experience, skills, knowledge, expertise, integrity, any potential conflict of interest and other qualities which are relevant for the Board to discharge his or her responsibilities in an effective and competent manner;  
(c) the candidate's independence (for the appointment/ re-election of Independent and Non-Executive Director);  
(d) the candidate's ability to allocate time and commitment to attend to the Group's affairs; and  
(e) the annual assessment, including fit and proper assessment of the candidate (for the re-election of a retiring Director).

Pursuant to the Company's Constitution, one-third (1/3) of the Board is subject to retirement by rotation at each AGM provided always that each Director shall retire at least once in every three (3) years and the retiring Director shall be eligible for re-election. Further, a retiring Director shall retain office until the conclusion of the AGM at which he retires.

# 4. Annual Assessment

The NRC bears the responsibility of conducting an annual evaluation of the performance and effectiveness of the entire Board, the various Board Committees, and individual Directors. This evaluation process is overseen by the NRC Chairman and facilitated with the assistance of the Company Secretary, who administers questionnaires to gather feedback.

The NRC had on 30 August 2024 assessed the effectiveness of the Board, its Committees and the contribution of each Director by identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the Board for the FYE 2024.

The Board's evaluation process encompasses several key aspects, including the performance assessment of the Board and its various Committees, self-evaluation by Directors, and an evaluation of the independence of Independent Directors. These assessments revolve primary areas relating to board structure, boardroom activities, Board and Chairman's roles and responsibilities, Board's roles and responsibilities in dealing with ESG issues and Board Committees' roles and responsibilities. For Directors' self-evaluation, specific criteria are considered, including their fit and appropriateness, conflict of interests or potential conflict of interests, ability and competence, personal qualities, mix of skills technical knowledge, objectivity and their level of engagement and contribution during Board and Committee meetings.

The Board expressed satisfaction with the evaluation outcomes. It was confident that the skills and experiences of the current Directors align with the requirements outlined in the skills matrix. Additionally, it affirmed that the Chairman possesses the leadership qualities necessary to safeguard the interests of stakeholders and ensure the Group's profitability. The Directors also demonstrated their commitment by dedicating the requisite time and effort to fulfil their responsibilities to the Company and the Group throughout the year. The NRC concurred with the re-appointment of existing members to the various Board Committees for the upcoming year.

The NRC maintains an ongoing commitment to assess and identify the training requirements of its members aimed at equipping Directors with the knowledge and skills necessary to effectively fulfil their roles and responsibilities as members of the Board.

# PRINCIPLE A: BOARD LEADERSHIP AND EFFECTIVENESS (CONT'D)

# III. REMUNERATION

The Company's approach to determining the remuneration of Directors and Senior Management is driven by the objective of offering equitable and competitive compensation. This strategy aims to attract and retain a high-calibre team that benefits the Company. The remuneration packages for Executive Directors and Senior Management comprise a fixed component (in the form of a base salary and, where applicable, fixed allowances determined by the Group's Human Resource policies) and variable components (which would normally comprise of annual bonus) together with benefits-in-kind, if any, to reward performance that supports the Group's strategy and creates sustainable long-term value for shareholders.

When assessing the structure and level of Directors' fees for Non-Executive Directors, the NRC takes into account the roles and responsibilities and time commitment of Directors. The NRC also benchmarks against industry peers' practices, the demands and complexities associated with the Company's operations and its performance. Each Non-Executive Director receives a fixed base fee, and a meeting allowance for attendance at Board, Board Committee, and general meetings. The fees and benefits for Directors are proposed by the NRC for the Board consideration for tabling to the shareholders for approval at the AGM. Notably, Directors abstain from voting to approve their own fees and benefits.

The Remuneration Policy is outlined in the Board Charter and is accessible for reference on the Group's website at www.southernscore.com.my.

The Directors' remuneration paid/payable for FYE 2024 of the Company and the Group on an individual basis is set out below:

Directors abstained from voting on their own remunerations. Similarly, Executive Directors are not involved in deciding on their own remuneration.

For Senior Management remuneration, due to confidentiality and sensitivity of information, the Board is of the view that it would not be in its best interest to fully disclose the detailed remuneration of each member of Senior Management on a named basis due to the competitive nature of human resource market and the Company should maintain confidentiality on employees' remuneration packages.

As an alternative, the Board decided to disclose the aggregate remuneration of the Senior Management (excluding Executive Directors) for the FYE 2024 as follows:-

<table><tr><td>Group</td><td>Salaries, wages, bonuses and other emoluments (RM)</td><td>Benefits-in-kind (RM)</td><td>Total (RM)</td></tr><tr><td>Senior Management*</td><td>1,647,098</td><td>11,100</td><td>1,658,198</td></tr></table>

* Senior Management team comprises of the Ms. Lee Chen Nee (Chief Financial Officer of Finance & Accounting); Mr. Pang Cheng Wei (Head of Legal & Corporate Communication); Puan Sri Datin Seri Elaine Lee Kuan Kiow (Director of Human Resource & Administrative); & Ir. Ong Beng Hoe (Director of Development & Projects).

In accordance with the Remuneration Policy, the Board recognises the significance of offering competitive remuneration packages to Senior Management based on their scope of responsibilities and performance. The Board emphasises that this approach is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, as it helps motivate and retain talented and dedicated Senior Management personnel, thereby promoting the Company's growth prospects.

# PRINCIPLE B: EFFECTIVE AUDIT AND RISK MANAGEMENT

# I. ARMC

# 1. Composition

The ARMC solely comprises the Non-Executive Directors. All ARMC members are financially literate and are able to analyse and interpret financial statements in order to effectively discharge their duties and responsibilities as members of the ARMC. The Chairman of the ARMC is not the Chairman of the Board ensuring that the impartiality and objectivity of the Board's review on the ARMC's findings and recommendations remain intact.

The ARMC's Terms of Reference ("TOR") stipulate that any former partner of an external audit firm must observe a cooling-off period of at least three (3) years before being eligible for appointment as a member of the ARMC.

The NRC conducts an annual assessment of the composition of the ARMC and subsequently recommends its composition to the Board for approval. This process ensures that all ARMC members meet the criteria of independence, financial literacy and a clear understanding of matters falling under the ARMC's purview.

# 2. External Auditors

The ARMC conducts an annual assessment to evaluate the suitability, objectivity, and independence of the external auditors. In this evaluation, the ARMC takes into consideration various factors, including the audit firm's experience and available resources. The ARMC has obtained written assurance from the external auditors confirming their independence throughout the course of the audit engagement, as per the terms of all relevant professional and regulatory requirements, and was satisfied that the external auditors have carried out their work independently. The specific procedures for this assessment are outlined in the ARMC's TOR, which is available for reference on the Company's website at www.southernscore.com.my.

Moreover, the external auditors are granted direct access to the ARMC, enabling them to promptly bring forward any concerns or issues that may arise. The ARMC meets with the external auditors at least once a year, in the absence of Executive Directors and Management. During these meetings, discussions encompass a range of topics, including audit findings, audit plans, and the Company's financial statements.

# REVIEW OF THE STATEMENT BY EXTERNAL AUDITORS

As required by Rule 15.23 of the AMLR of Bursa Securities, the external auditors have reviewed this Statement. Their review was performed in accordance with Audit and Assurance Practice Guide 3 ("AAPG 3"), Guidance for Auditors on Engagements to report on the Statement included in the Annual Report, issued by the Malaysian Institute of Accountants. AAPG 3 does not require the External Auditors to consider whether this Statement covers all risk and controls, or to form an opinion on the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control system.

Based on the review by the External Auditors, nothing has come to their attention that causes them to believe that this Statement intended to be included in the annual report is not prepared, in all material respect, in accordance with the disclosures required by paragraph 41 and 42 of the Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control (Guidelines for Directors of Listed Issuers) to be set out, nor is the Statement factually inaccurate.

# CONCLUSION

The Directors believe that the system of the internal control is considered appropriate to the current business operations and that the risk taken is at an acceptable level within the context of the business environment of the Group. It should be noted that such arrangements do not eliminate the possibility of collusion or deliberate circumvention of procedures by employees. Human error and/or other unforeseen circumstances can result in poor judgement. For the financial year under review, there were no significant internal control deficiencies or material weaknesses resulting in material losses, contingencies or uncertainties which would require separate disclosure in this Annual Report.

This Statement is made in accordance with the resolution of the Board on 29 October 2024.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF SOUTHERN SCORE BUILDERS BERHAD

(INCORPORATED IN MALAYSIA)

REGISTRATION NO: 200301019817 (622237 - D)

# Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements

# Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Southern Score Builders Berhad, which comprise the statements of financial position as at 30 June 2024 of the Group and of the Company, and the statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows of the Group and of the Company for the financial year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including material accounting policy information, as set out on pages 88 to 128.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and of the Company as at 30 June 2024, and of their financial performance and their cash flows for the financial year then ended in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS Accounting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.

# Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Independence and Other Ethical Responsibilities

We are independent of the Group and of the Company in accordance with the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, Conduct and Practice) of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants ("By-Laws") and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) ("IESBA Code"), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the By-Laws and the IESBA Code.

# Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for current financial year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Allowance for Expected Credit Losses of Trade Receivables

# The Risk

Refer to Note 7 to the financial statements. We focused on this area because the Group has material amount of trade receivables. The key associated risk was the recoverability of billed trade receivables as management judgement is required in determining the completeness of the allowance for expected credit losses of trade receivables and in assessing its adequacy through considering the expected recoverability of the year-end trade receivables.

# Our Response

We have obtained an understanding of the Group's controls relating to credit control and approval process, how the Group identifies and assesses the allowance for expected credit losses of trade receivables and how the Group makes the accounting estimates for the allowance. We have also reviewed the ageing analysis of the trade receivables and tested the reliability thereof and assessed the recoverability of the overdue trade receivables through examination of cash receipts subsequent to the year end.

(INCORPORATED IN MALAYSIA)

REGISTRATION NO: 200301019817 (622237 - D)

# Key Audit Matters (cont'd)

Revenue Recognition for Construction Contracts

# The Risk

There are significant accounting judgements involved including determining the stage of completion, the timing of revenue recognition and the calculation under the percentage of completion method made by management in applying the Group's revenue recognition policies to construction contracts entered into by the Group. The nature of these judgements resulted in them being susceptible to management bias.

Contract revenue should include the amount agreed in the initial contract, plus revenue from alterations in the original contract work, plus claims and incentive payments that are expected to be collected and that can be measured reliably.

Refer to Note 18 to the financial statements, total revenue from construction contracts was RM170,717,663 which represents  $100\%$  of the Group's revenue in this financial year.

# Our Response

We performed a range of audit procedures which included obtaining samples of contracts or letter of awards, reviewing for change orders or variation orders, reviewing estimated profit and costs to complete and enquiring of key personnel regarding adjustments for job costing and potential contract losses.

We assessed whether the revenue and cost recognition policies are appropriate in accordance with MFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.

There is no key audit matter to be communicated in respect of the audit of the financial statements of the Company.

# Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditors' Report Thereon

The Directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but does not include the financial statements of the Group and of the Company and our auditors' report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditors' report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Statements

The Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that give a true and fair view in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS Accounting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF SOUTHERN SCORE BUILDERS BERHAD (INCORPORATED IN MALAYSIA)

REGISTRATION NO: 200301019817 (622237 - D)

# Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Statements (cont'd)

In preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group's and of the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors intend either to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

# Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.  
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's and of the Company's internal control.  
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors.  
- Conclude on the appropriateness of Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's or the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.  
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.  
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements of the Group. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

(INCORPORATED IN MALAYSIA)

REGISTRATION NO: 200301019817 (622237 - D)

# Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements (cont'd)

We communicate with the Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identified during our audit.

We also provided the Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

From the matters communicated with the Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# Other Matter

This report is made solely to the members of the Company, as a body, in accordance with Section 266 of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility to any other person for the content of this report.

# 1. GENERAL INFORMATION

The Company is a public limited liability company, incorporated and domiciled in Malaysia and listed on the ACE Market of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad. The registered office of the Company is located at Unit 621, 6th Floor, Block A, Kelana Centre Point, No. 3, Jalan SS7/19, Kelana Jaya, 47301 Petaling Jaya, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia.

The principal place of business of the Company is located at Unit No. 21-3, PV7, Jalan Melati Utama 2, Taman Melati Utama, 53100 Setapak, Kuala Lumpur.

The Company was principally engaged in investment holding, research and development in information technology.

The principal activities of the subsidiary are indicated in Note 4 to the financial statements.

There have been no significant changes in the nature of these principal activities of the Company and its subsidiary during the financial year.

The Company is a subsidiary of Super Advantage Property Sdn. Bhd., a private limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in Malaysia.

The financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 29 October 2024.

# 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# 2.1 Statement of Compliance

The financial statements of the Group and the Company have been prepared in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards ("MFRSs"), IFRS Accounting Standards ("IFRSs") and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.

# 2.2 Basis of Measurement

The financial statements of the Group and the Company are prepared under the historical cost convention, unless otherwise indicated in the summary of material accounting policies.

Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability, or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to by the Group and the Company.

The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.

A fair value measurement of a non-financial market takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.

The Group and the Company use valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, recognised the use of relevant observable inputs and recognised the use of unobservable inputs.

# 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT'D)

# 2.2 Basis of Measurement (cont'd)

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are recognised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to their fair value measurement as a whole:

Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to their fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.

Level 3 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to their fair value measurement is unobservable.

For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group and the Company determine whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to their fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.

The Group and the Company have established control framework in respect of measurement of fair values of financial instruments.

# 2.3 Functional and Presentation Currency

These financial statements are presented in Ringgit Malaysia ("RM"), which is the Company's functional currency and all values are rounded to the nearest RM except otherwise stated.

# 2.4 MFRSs

# 2.4.1 Adoption of New Standards/Amendments/Improvements to MFRSs

At the beginning of the current financial year, the Group and the Company adopted new standards/amendments/improvements to MFRSs which are mandatory for the financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023.

Initial application of the new standards/amendments/improvements to the standards did not have material impact to the financial statements, except for:-

Amendments to MFRS 101 Presentation of Financial Statements - Disclosure of Accounting Policies

The amendments change the requirements in MFRS 101 with regard to disclosure of accounting policies. The amendments replace all instances of the term 'significant' with 'material'. Accounting policy information is material if, when considered together with other information included in an entity's financial statements, if can reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general-purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements.

The supporting paragraphs in MFRS 101 are also amended to clarify that accounting policy information that related to immaterial transactions, other events or conditions is immaterial and need not be disclosed. Accounting policy information may be material because of the nature of the related transactions, other events or conditions, even if the amounts are immaterial. However, not all accounting policy information relating to material transactions, other events or conditions is itself material. The Malaysia Accounting Standards Board has also developed guidance and examples to explain and demonstrate the application of the 'four-step materiality process' described in MFRS Practice Statement 2.

# 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT'D)

# 2.5 Significant Accounting Estimates and Judgements

Estimates, assumptions concerning the future and judgements are made in the preparation of the financial statements. They affect the application of the Group's and the Company's accounting policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, and disclosures made. Estimates and underlying assumptions are assessed on an on-going basis and are based on experience and relevant factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The actual results may differ from the judgements, estimates and assumptions made by management, and will seldom equal the estimated results.

# 2.5.1 Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty

Information about significant estimates and assumptions that have the most significant effect on recognition and measurement of assets, liabilities, income and expenses are discussed below.

Useful Lives of Depreciable Assets

The management estimates the useful lives of the property, plant and equipment and to be within 4 to 10 years and reviews the useful lives of depreciable assets at each reporting date. The management assesses that the useful lives represent the expected utility of the assets to the Group and the Company. Actual results, however, may vary due to change in the expected level of usage and technological developments, which may result in an adjustment to the Group's and the Company's assets.

Construction Contracts

The Group recognises contract revenue based on stage of completion method. The stage of completion is measured by reference to the contract costs incurred up to reporting date as a percentage of total estimated cost for each contract. Significant judgement is required in determining the stage of completion, the extent of the contract costs incurred, the estimated total contract costs, the profitability of the contracts, including the foreseeable losses, potential claims (variation orders) to owners of the projects and counter claims from subcontractor and liquidated ascertained damages ("LAD") based on expected completion dates of the contracts.

In making this judgement, the Directors took into consideration the current circumstances and replied on input from the Group's project managers, external consultants, where appropriate and past experience. In addition, in determining the provision for LAD to be recorded, the Directors also assessed the ability of the Group to recover from the subcontractors, the potential LAD imposed on the Group by the project owners for delays in projects caused directly by the subcontractor.

Provision for Expected Credit Losses ("ECLs") of Trade Receivables and Contract Assets

The Group uses a provision matrix to calculate ECLs for trade receivables and contract assets. The provision rates are based on days past due for groupings of various customer segments that have similar loss patterns (i.e., by geography, product type, customer type and rating).

The provision matrix is initially based on the Group's historical observed default rates. The Group will calibrate the matrix to adjust the historical credit loss experience with forward-looking information. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

- 30 JUNE 2024

# 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT'D)

# 2.5 Significant Accounting Estimates and Judgements (cont'd)

# 2.5.1 Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty (cont'd)

Provision for Expected Credit Losses ("ECLs") of Trade Receivables and Contract Assets (cont'd)

The assessment of the correlation between historical observed default rates, forecast economic conditions and ECLs is a significant estimate. The amount of ECLs is sensitive to changes in circumstances and of forecast economic conditions. The Group's historical credit loss experience and forecast of economic conditions may also not be representative of customer's actual default in the future.

Impairment of Non-financial Assets

An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's or cash-generating unit's ("CGU") carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. To determine the recoverable amount, management estimates expected future cash flows from each CGU and determines a suitable interest rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. In the process of measuring expected future cash flows, management make assumptions about future operating results. The actual results may vary, and may cause significant adjustments to the Group's and the Company's assets within the next financial year.

In most cases, determining the applicable discount rate involves estimating the appropriate adjustment to market risk and the appropriate adjustment to asset-specific risk factors.

Income Taxes/Deferred Tax Liabilities

Significant judgement is involved in determining the Group's and the Company's provision for income taxes. There are certain transactions and computations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business.

The Group and the Company recognised tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recognised, such difference will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.

# 2.5.2 Significant Management Judgement

# Material Accounting Policy Information

# (a) Recognition and Measurement

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised as an asset if, and only if, it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the Company and the cost can be measured reliably.

Right-of-use Assets

The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the leases (i.e., the date the underlying assets are available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The costs of right-of-use assets include the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received.

# 4. INVESTMENT IN A SUBSIDIARY (CONT'D)

# Material Accounting Policy Information

(i) Investment in subsidiary is measured in the Company's statement of financial position at cost less any impairment loss.  
(ii) Consolidation - Reverse Acquisition upon Consolidation

Consolidated financial statements prepared following a reverse acquisition are issued under the name of the legal parent (accounting acquiree) but described in the notes as a continuation of the financial statements of the legal subsidiary (accounting acquirer), with one adjustment, which is to adjust retroactively the accounting acquirer's legal capital to reflect the legal capital of the accounting acquiree. That adjustment is required to reflect the capital of the legal parent (the accounting acquiree). Comparative information presented in those consolidated financial statements also is retroactively adjusted to reflect the legal capital of the legal parent (accounting acquiree).

Because the consolidated financial statements represent the continuation of the financial statements of the legal subsidiary except for its capital structure, the consolidated financial statements reflect:

(a) The assets and liabilities of the legal subsidiary (the accounting acquirer) recognised and measured at their pre-combination carrying amounts.  
(b) The assets and liabilities of the legal parent (the accounting acquiree) recognised and measured in accordance with the applicable accounting standard.  
(c) The retained earnings and other equity balances of the legal subsidiary (accounting acquirer) before the business combination.  
(d) The amount recognised as issued equity interests in the consolidated financial statements determined by adding the issued equity interest of the legal subsidiary (the accounting acquirer) outstanding immediately before the business combination to the fair value of the legal parent (accounting acquiree) determined in accordance with the applicable accounting standard. However, the equity structure (i.e. the number and type of equity interests issued) reflects the equity structure of the legal parent, including the equity interests of the legal parent issued to effect the combination. Accordingly, the equity structure of the legal subsidiary is restated using the exchange ratio established in the acquisition agreement to reflect the number of shares of the legal parent issued in the reverse acquisition.

Typically, the amount will be billed once the construction works have been inspected by customers' quantity surveyor and payment is expected within normal credit terms. The significant decrease in contract assets in 2024 is the result of the completed construction progress at the end of the year.

The contract liabilities consist of advance billings in excess of revenue recognised over time during the construction period. The increase in contract liabilities primarily related to advance consideration received from customer for construction contract. The contract liabilities were expected to be recognised as revenue over a period of 60 days.

# Material accounting policy information

# (a) Recognition and Measurement

At the commencement date of the leases, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including insubstance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses (unless they are incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.

# (b) Recognition Exemption

The Group and the Company apply the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases that are considered to be low-value. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

# Financial Risk Management

The Group and the Company are exposed to financial risks arising from their operations and the use of financial instruments. Financial risk management policies are established to ensure that adequate resources are available for the development of the Group's and of the Company's business whilst managing its credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk. The Group and the Company operate within clearly defined policies and procedures that are approved by the Board of Directors to ensure the effectiveness of the risk management process.

The main areas of financial risks faced by the Group and the Company and the policies of the Group and of the Company in respect of the major areas of treasury activities are set out as follows:-

# (a) Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk of a financial loss to the Group and to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. It is the Group's and the Company's policy to enter into financial instrument with a diversity of creditworthy counterparties. The Group and the Company do not expect to incur material credit losses of its financial assets or other financial instruments.

Concentration of credit risk exists when changes in economic, industry and geographical factors similarly affect the group of counterparties whose aggregate credit exposure is significant in relation to the Group's and to the Company's total credit exposure. The Group's and the Company's transactions are entered into with diverse creditworthy counterparties, thereby mitigate any significant concentration of credit risk.

It is the Group's and the Company's policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. The Group and the Company do not offer credit terms without the approval of the management.

# 27. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONT'D)

# Financial Risk Management (cont'd)

The main areas of financial risks faced by the Group and the Company and the policies of the Group and of the Company in respect of the major areas of treasury activities are set out as follows (cont'd):

# (a) Credit Risk (cont'd)

The areas where the Group and the Company are exposed to credit risk are as follows:-

Receivables and Contract Assets

The net carrying amount of receivables is considered a reasonable approximate of fair value.

With a credit policy in place to ensure the credit risk is monitored on an on-going basis, the management has taken reasonable steps to ensure that receivables that are neither past due nor impaired are stated at their realisable values. A significant portion of the receivables are regular customers that have been transacting with the Group. The Group uses ageing analysis to monitor the credit quality of the receivables. Any receivables having significant balances past due more than credit terms granted are deemed to have higher credit risk, and are monitored individually.

Trade receivables that are neither past due nor impaired are creditworthy debtors with good payment records with the Group. None of the Group's trade receivables that are neither past due nor impaired have been renegotiated during the financial period.

Trade receivables of RM1,054,221 (2023: RM9,899,699) was past due but not impaired. The Directors are of the opinion that the receivables are collectible in view of long-term business relationship with the customers and no recent history of default.

An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date using a provision matrix to measure expected credit losses. The provision rates are based on overall past trend payments of the customers, financial performance of each individual customer and base lending rate and gross domestic product rate. All of these customers have low risk of default. The calculation reflects the probability-weighted outcome, the time value of money and reasonable and supportable information that is available at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.

None of the Group's financial assets are secured by collateral or other credit enhancement.

# Financial Risk Management (cont'd)

The main areas of financial risks faced by the Group and the Company and the policies of the Group and of the Company in respect of the major areas of treasury activities are set out as follows (cont'd):

# (a) Credit Risk (cont'd)

The areas where the Group and the Company are exposed to credit risk are as follows (cont'd):

# Corporate Guarantees

The maximum exposure to credit risk of the Group and the Company amounting to RM7,692,256 (2023: RM7,692,256) and RM22,749,620 (2023: RM12,806,291) respectively represented the outstanding banking facilities of third parties and its subsidiary as at the end of the reporting period.

The Group and the Company provide unsecured financial guarantee to bank in respect of banking facilities granted to third parties and its subsidiary. The Group and the Company monitor on an ongoing basis the results of the third parties and the subsidiary and repayments made by the third parties and the subsidiary. As at the end of reporting period, there was no indication that the third parties and the subsidiary would default on repayment.

The corporate guarantees do not have a determinable effect on the term of the credit facilities due to the bank requiring the Group and the Company's guarantees as a pre-condition for approving the banking facilities granted to the third parties and subsidiary. The actual terms of the credit facilities are likely to be the best indicator of "at market" term and hence the fair value of the credit facilities are equal to the credit facilities amount received by the third party and subsidiary. As such, there is no value on the corporate guarantees to be recognised in the financial statements.

# Intercompany Balances

The Company provides unsecured advances to its subsidiary and monitors the results of the subsidiary regularly.

As at the end of the reporting date, there was no indication that the carrying amount of amount due from the subsidiary are not recoverable.

# Cash and Cash Equivalents

The credit risk for cash and cash equivalents is considered negligible, since the counterparties are reputable banks with high quality external credit ratings and have no history of default. Consequently, the Company is of the view that the allowance is not material and hence, it is not provided for.

# (b) Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group and the Company will not be able to meet their financial obligations as and when they fall due as a result of shortage of funds.

In managing its exposures to liquidity risk arises principally from its various payables, lease liabilities and borrowings, the Group and the Company maintain a level of cash and cash equivalents deemed adequate by the management to ensure, as far as possible, that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities as and when they fall due.

The Group and the Company aim at maintaining a balance of sufficient cash and deposits and flexibility in funding by keeping diverse sources of committed and uncommitted credit facilities from various banks.

# (c) Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of the Group's and of the Company's financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.

The Group's and the Company's variable rate borrowings are exposed to a risk of change in cash flows due to changes in interest rates. Short term receivables and payables are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk.

The Group's and the Company's interest rate management objective is to manage the interest expenses consistent with maintaining an acceptable level of exposure to interest rate fluctuation. In order to achieve this objective, the Group and the Company target a mix of fixed and floating debt based on assessment of its existing exposure and desired interest rate profile.

Fair Value Sensitivity Analysis for Fixed Rate Instruments

The Group and the Company do not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, and the Group and the Company do not designate derivatives as hedging instruments under a fair value hedge accounting model. Therefore, a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect profit or loss.

Cash Flow Sensitivity Analysis for Floating Rate Instrument

The following table illustrates the sensitivity of profit to a reasonably possible change in interest rate of  $+/-25$  (30.6.2023:  $+/-25$ ) basis points ("bp"). These changes are considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions. The calculations are based on a change in the average market interest rate for each reporting date, and the financial instruments held at each reporting date that are sensitive to change in interest rates. All other variables are held constant.

# Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Group and the Company have established policies and procedures in respect of the fair value measurement.

Financial Assets that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

Certain financial assets of the Group and the Company are measured at fair value at the end of the reporting period/year. Details of fair value measurement of those financial assets are as follows:-

<table><tr><td></td><td colspan="2">Fair value</td><td>Fair value hierarchy</td><td>Valuation method and key inputs</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2024
