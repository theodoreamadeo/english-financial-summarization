//QinetiQ continues to provide critical expertise, protecting lives by serving the national interest of our customers - I'm proud of the important role we play in national defence and security, helping to make the world a safer place.

We continue to see unrest and conflict across many regions of the world, demonstrating the important role of the defence sector. QinetiQ is critical to national defence and security, delivering world-class engineering and technology through our committed and inspirational people.

Alongside our customers, we continue to witness the remarkable pace of change of modern warfare. Such structural change, coupled with escalating tensions, has resulted in unprecedented levels of funding. In April, the UK Government announced an incremental £75bn of defence spending, the 'biggest strengthening of our national defence in a generation', with defence spending set to rise to  $2.5\%$  of GDP by the end of the decade. Such commitment, and transatlantic recognition of the requirement for greater investment, transcends party politics. It is increasingly apparent that we are at a turning point in terms of global security, with the consequences of inaction potentially catastrophic. Within this context, I am extremely proud of the critical and unique role we have in developing, testing and assuring cutting-edge systems that give our customers advantage on the battlefield. This, combined with the work we do to train our customers to use those enhanced sovereign defence capabilities in the land, sea, air, cyber and space domains, ensures they are able to protect and enhance their defence and security.

We have a clear and relevant strategy to drive meaningful outcomes for our customers, growth and opportunity for our people, and significant returns for our shareholders.

We continue to see increased demand for our six distinctive offerings with particularly strong progress in EMEA Services. Budget delays and market uncertainty has impacted the speed of growth in the US over the past year; whilst this was an area of risk identified at the point of the Avantus acquisition it has been challenging to offset these delays, impacting the overall Global Solutions segment this year. Despite these setbacks, at a Group-level we once again achieved good revenue growth and stable margins and remain confident in the future prospects of the business, which is well aligned to the planned structural growth areas of defence spending.

As a Board we continue to actively engage in the refinement and iteration of Company strategy - at our October 2023 Board meeting we engaged external experts from our main customers, partners and academia to review and consider the  $10+$  year view of the Company and its strategic direction. As part of this we remain focused on delivering for our customers, people and shareholders; both organically, and once current acquisitions are proven, with further acquisitions.

# Delivering for our customers, people and shareholders

We understand that excellent customer relationships are critical to our success. Ensuring we retain an engaged and committed workforce helps us to meet and exceed customer expectations. We actively engage as a Board with our people, and this year have enjoyed extensive interactions with our colleagues in Australia, the UK and the US, including a number of site visits.

I'm delighted to have engaged directly with a large number of shareholders in the last year, either via one-to-one meetings or through the completion of our Shareholder Perception Audit - all of these engagements have helped me and the Board to understand the views of our UK, US and European shareholders to shape our thinking and decision-making. We are pleased to demonstrate our balanced capital allocation policy with the commencement of the share buyback and, reflecting our confidence in the

future, an increase in our progressive dividend growth rate from  $5\%$  to  $7\%$ . The buyback represents an attractive use of our capital to drive shareholder value whilst maintaining the financial flexibility to invest in the ongoing execution of our strategy to deliver sustainable growth and attractive returns.

Sustainability remains an important area for consideration and debate, both within the business and at Board-level. In the past year we have retained our rating as a top-rated ESG company by Sustainability and our AA rating from MSCI. We have identified the most material issues for our business and monitor these as non-financial KPIs, where we are pleased to have seen improvements across safety (lost time incidents), employee engagement and Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions.

# Board changes

On 16 April we announced that Carol Borg, Group Chief Financial Officer (CFO) would be stepping down immediately from her role. In her place we have appointed Martin Cooper and he is expected to join the QinetiQ Board no later than October. Martin is a qualified chartered accountant and has more than 25 years' experience leading multi-disciplinary teams in senior finance roles. He joins QinetiQ from BAE Systems where he held a number of positions including UK & Rest of World Financial Controller, Divisional Finance Director and most recently Investor Relations Director.

To enable a smooth transition in the interim period prior to Martin joining QinetiQ, Heather Cashin, currently the Group Financial Controller, has been appointed Interim Group CFO. David Smith, former Group CFO of QinetiQ, has agreed to provide advice and support services to Heather and the Board during the interim period.

In addition to the above, a few months ago I was delighted to announce two new Board appointments which further strengthens the breadth and depth of skills on the Board: Ross McEwan CBE and Dina Knight both joined the Board on 1 March 2024.

Ross has been Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of National Australia Bank Limited (NAB) since December 2019 and will retire from NAB on 1 July 2024. Ross brings extensive global business experience at the highest level and his successful track record is recognised in both the UK and in Australia. Dina is Chief People Officer of global technology services and solutions provider Datatec Group and Logicalis International, accountable for its people operations and strategy. Dina is a seasoned HR professional and will bring a broad spectrum of corporate strategic experience to the role.

Susan Searle will remain as Chair of the Remuneration Committee for the time being to provide an extended handover to Dina, after which Susan Searle will step down as a Nonexecutive Board member. I would like to thank Susan for her invaluable contribution to both the Board and the QinetiQ Group.

Larry Prior took the decision to step down from the Board to be able to devote his time and focus to another corporate role. Larry's thoughtful advice and guidance to the Board and the business will be missed. During the coming year we will be looking at options for bringing a US perspective back onto the Board. Overall I am confident we have the right mix of skills and experience on the Board to provide effective challenge and support to the business as it continues its global growth.

Whilst not Executive-level appointments, I am also pleased to see the QinetiQ Leadership Team develop further, with the appointment of Iain Stevenson to the newly created role of Chief Operating Officer, and Will Blamey, as Chief Executive of our UK Defence sector. The new role of Chief Operating Officer will provide increased focus on the delivery of consistent operational performance across the Group as we continue to scale and grow.

Finally, I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Steve Wadey, our Group CEO, and all of the QinetiQ leaders and employees for pulling together to deliver for our customers and shareholders.

# Looking ahead

We are well placed to deliver our long-term growth and returns ambitions, with good customer relationships, strong employee engagement and positive support from shareholders for our strategy. I remain hugely impressed by the commitment, determination and focus of our people, living our values of Integrity, Collaboration and Performance on a day-to-day basis, making a real difference to defence and security around the world.

//We enter this year with strong momentum and increasing spending in our major markets, which gives us confidence to increase our guidance for FY25 and underpins our FY27 outlook of c£2.4bn organic revenue at c.12% margin. //

1: Our six distinctive offerings are: Experimentation and Technology, Robotics and Autonomous Systems, Engineering Services and Support, Test and Evaluation, Cyber and Information Advantage, Training and Mission Rehearsal

# We have delivered strong overall Group financial results, against the background of difficult market conditions in the US.

These results have been achieved through the outstanding skills and capabilities of our people working in partnership with our customers and supply chain. The world is experiencing the highest and most rapidly evolving threat environment for a generation and our teams have continued to deliver our highly relevant services and products, critical to enduring national defence and security priorities.

Since launching our strategy in 2016 to build a disruptive and uniquely integrated global defence and security company, we have grown our revenue by more than 2.5x, doubled earnings and now have more than 8,500 highly-skilled people across 60 sites globally. Our depth and breadth of expertise across the defence and security lifecycle helps our customers to rapidly create, test and use capability to stay ahead of the threat. Our cutting edge technology and innovation, allied with world leading expertise in science, technology and engineering, is critical to enabling our customers' mission.

Our strategy is structurally aligned and focused on enabling the shared security mission of our Australian, United Kingdom and United States (AUKUS) customers and their allies. Our six distinctive offerings are highly relevant to the rapidly changing character of warfare and aligned to our customers' high-priority areas that are attracting increasing defence and security spending, most notably in Research & Development (R&D), Test & Evaluation (T&E), Training & Mission Rehearsal and Cyber & Intelligence.

For our people, we've made significant progress creating an environment where they can all thrive, with our highest ever level of employee engagement achieved this year. Having a highly skilled and engaged team, with an inclusive culture, enables us to deliver for our customers' mission with even greater agility and pace.

For our shareholders, we are focused on continuing disciplined execution of our strategy and are on-track to deliver our FY27 outlook of c.f.24bn organic revenue at c.12% margin. With a strong balance sheet and enhanced focus on disciplined capital allocation, we are well positioned and have a clear strategy with optionality for investment in sustainable growth and further shareholder returns.

# Performance in the year

We delivered another year of strong overall Group operational and financial performance. Revenue growth was  $21\%$ , or  $14\%$  on an organic constant currency basis and underlying operating profit grew by  $20\%$ , or  $16\%$  on an organic constant currency basis, with stable margin at  $11.3\%$ . We continued our track record of high cash generation with underlying cash conversion at  $104\%$ , contributing to the reduction of our leverage (net debt to EBITDA) from  $0.8x$  to  $0.5x$ . Order intake achieved a record high of  $\pm 1.74bn$ , with a book-to-bill of  $1.1x$  and an order backlog of  $\pm 2.9bn$ . As part of our enhanced capital allocation policy, we launched a value accretive  $\pm 100m$  share buyback programme and have increased the growth rate of our progressive dividend from  $5\%$  to  $7\%$ .

# EMEA Services

EMEA Services delivered excellent growth, achieving  $19\%$  organic revenue growth with stable margin at  $11.5\%$ . This performance was driven by the strong execution of prior year orders and consistent operational delivery on our long-term contracts.

In the UK, service delivery partnerships remain the bedrock of our offering. Our large long-term Engineering Delivery Partner (EDP) contract has now delivered more than £1.5bn of orders since inception, enabling capability and sustainment of the majority of UK military systems; and we signed a Principles Agreement with UK MOD to extend the Long Term Partnering Agreement (LTPA) to 2033, where we test, trial, train and evaluate (T3E) national defence and security capabilities critical to mitigating global threats. Both of these contracts make a meaningful contribution to the sustainable performance and returns generated by EMEA Services. In addition, to accelerate the production of mission data for

the Royal Air Force, the SOCIETAS transformation programme has achieved full operating capability three months early. Also, in the UK we commenced support of the new AUKUS submarine programme through initial tasking as a capability partner. In Australia, as a leading provider within Team Nova, we secured a three year extension to our Managed Service Provider (MSP) contract to provide technical advisory services in support of the Australian Capability Acquisition and Sustainment Group; and we continue to successfully develop the high energy defensive laser system prototype in collaboration with the Defence Science and Technology Group. In Germany, we signed a significant, multi-year contract to provide aerial training and mission rehearsal services for their Armed Forces.

Strategic achievements include:

- Formidable Shield for NATO – Over three weeks in May 2023 at UK MOD Hebrides, we hosted Formidable Shield 23, one of the world's largest and most complex tests of naval and missile defences. The exercise saw over 20 ships, 35 aircraft, and nearly 4,000 allied military personnel from 13 NATO nations come together to test military platforms, missiles, and sensor systems against representative threat scenarios in realistic live-fire mission rehearsal exercises.

- DragonFire for the UK - In collaboration with the UK's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl), MBDA and Leonardo, we demonstrated the capabilities of our world-leading beam combining technology with the UK's first high-power firing of a laser weapon against aerial targets. Subsequently, the MOD has recently announced that the cutting-edge DragonFire laser directed energy weapon system will be installed on Royal Navy warships for the first time from 2027, far sooner than previously envisaged.

Joint Adversarial Training and Testing Services (JATTS) for Australia - The JATTS contract supports our ambition to double the size of the Australian business over the next four years through training support to the Australian Defence Force with 'enemy' force aircraft and aerial targets. In the year we achieved a  $20\%$  increase in aircraft flying hours and  $90\%$  more aerial target missions than originally planned. A notable highlight was providing our threat representation services into the Talisman Sabre training exercise involving 13 allied nations and involving 30,000 military personnel.

With strong visibility, and a pipeline of significant opportunities, our confidence remains high that EMEA Services will continue to support the sustainable growth of the Group.

# Global Solutions

Global Solutions was impacted by difficult market conditions in the US, with recent headwinds including one of the longest periods of Continuing Resolution on record. Overall, revenue was up  $23\%$ , declining  $3\%$  on an organic basis, with margin remaining stable at  $10.5\%$ .

Avantus delivered a high single digit revenue decline over the course of the year. However, the business achieved modest revenue growth in the second half, with double digit margin and cash conversion of  $c.100\%$  over the full year. With the integration now complete, the benefits of Group synergies are now being realised with  $\\(977m$  of total contract awards during the year and a funded book-to-bill of 1.2x. We remain confident of Avantus delivering value for shareholders and expect mid-single digit growth in FY25 before returning to double digit growth in FY26. Notable contract awards include a  $\$ 170m \) five year Tethered Aerostat Radar System (TARS) contract providing surveillance operations along the southern border of the US and its territories, a  $\\(126m$  five year contract to provide technical, professional, and support services to the Office of the Secretary of Defense Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO), and a  $\$ 224m \), five year, firm fixed price contract with the US Space Development Agency (SDA) to provide systems engineering and technical assistance support needed to deliver the Proliferated Space Warfare Architecture.

Revenue in the rest of Global Solutions was broadly flat for the year, due to the loss of the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV) opportunity. We also saw the planned production ramp down of the Common Robotic System - Individual (CRS-I) small ground robots in the US, offset by QinetiQ Target Systems (QTS) achieving its highest ever production levels within the year in the UK. A significant step forward in the year was the successful certification of our Banshee target by the US Threat Systems Management Office, enabling market entry and opening up growth opportunities in FY25 and beyond.

# Tethered Aerostat Radar System for

the US - We were awarded a five year $170m TARS contract as a Prime System Integrator to the Department of Homeland Security providing persistent surveillance operations and sustainment along the southern border of the US and its territories. Upon award, we successfully transitioned eight operational sites in six weeks, hired 229 employees, negotiated union agreements, and the management of all critical services providers. We are on track to secure more than  $10\%$  on-contract growth in FY25 through expanded mission scope and capability enhancements, and have identified c.  $50\%$  on-contract growth opportunities over the life of the programme.

# - Robotic Combat Vehicle Light (RCV-L)

for the US - Working alongside Oshkosh Defence, we were one of four awardees for the RCV-L full scale prototype contract from the US Army, following successful operational trials. The RCV-L solution works directly with warfighters on the ground providing an intelligence and reconnaissance platform used for forward scouting with the ability to carry lethal payloads. The prototype contract positions us well to compete for our share of the future development and production phases worth up to $500m.

# - Next Generation Advanced Bomb Suits

(NGABS) –A five year, $83m contract for the testing and production of over 700 next generation advanced bomb suits for the US Army, demonstrating our ability to leverage our R&D into core capability.

With an attractively positioned portfolio of high priority capabilities, and the integration of Avantus complete, we are confident that Global Solutions is well placed to deliver a meaningful contribution to our FY27 organic revenue target of c£2.4bn.

# Aligned with high priority needs

Global tensions continue at elevated levels. In the Middle East, Houthi forces attempt to disrupt world supply lines and broaden the Yemeni civil war, whilst Iran has escalated the Israel-Hamas conflict, and Russian forces remain entrenched within Ukraine. China continues to provide a destabilising influence, notably in the Indo-Pacific, as does North Korea and transnational terrorist networks. As a result, Australia, the UK and the US, through the AUKUS security pact, and with their 5-Eyes and NATO allies, continue to review their evolving defence and security capabilities and investment priorities.

Given this heightened threat environment, levels of defence spending are expected to increase over the long-term. In the US, the Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) budget is the largest ever at \(145bn³. Governments in the UK and Australia intend to increase defence spending to c.2.5% of GDP over the long-term, with the UK ring-fencing 5% of the defence budget for R&D and 2% for exploitation. In total, our addressable market is estimated to be greater than £30bn⁴ per annum. More broadly, a record 18 member countries are now set to meet NATO's target of spending 2% of their economic output on defence and security this year, a marked increase from 11 out of the 31 members a year ago.

These investment priorities are driving increasing spending in high-priority areas such as R&D, T&E, Training & Mission Rehearsal, and Cyber & Intelligence, to enable our customers to maintain and develop technological superiority in areas such as robotics, autonomy, directed energy, hypersonics, integrated sensing, cyber, advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence. We remain at the forefront of the adoption and integration of these new and emerging technologies with traditional defence capabilities, providing enhanced inter-operability between allied systems and enhancing our customers' operational effectiveness.

A combination of our global reach and alignment to these high-priority high-growth areas provides confidence in the Group's ability to deliver organic revenue growth at double the rate of growth of national defence budgets, as we have done consistently over the past five years.

# Clear strategy delivering

At this time of heightened geopolitical uncertainty and conflict, our purpose has never been more relevant: protecting lives by serving the national security interests of our customers. With a unique customer value proposition to rapidly create, test and train effective use of capability, we enable our customers to respond to their national and global security needs and counter the increasing threat at pace.

With a clear purpose and strategy, the Group is well positioned to deliver sustainable shareholder value. Our strategy has three interrelated components:

1. Delivering six distinctive and mutually supportive offerings: We co-create high-value differentiated solutions for our customers in experimentation, test, training, information, engineering and autonomous systems;

2. Applying disruptive and innovative technology and business models: We invest in and apply disruptive business models, digitisation and advanced technologies to enable our customers' operational mission at pace; and, 3. Leveraging those capabilities across our global operations: We are developing an integrated global defence and security company that leverages our capability in the UK, the US, Australia, Canada and Germany.

The disciplined execution of our strategy is building a global platform and delivering sustainable growth, underpinning our FY27 outlook to deliver c.£2.4bn organic revenue at c.12% margin. Our focus on our customers' high-priority areas, specifically Research and Development (R&D), Test and Evaluation (T&E), Training & Mission Rehearsal, and Cyber & Intelligence, provides confidence in our high single digit revenue growth guidance and is why our growth outpaces headline defence spending. Our strategy is further underpinned by a record order intake of £1.74bn with a backlog of £2.9bn, and an exceptionally strong pipeline of future growth opportunities worth more than £11bn over the next five years.

# Disciplined capital allocation

Our strategy to deliver long-term sustainable growth is underpinned by an enhanced focus on disciplined capital allocation and execution. Given the highly cash generative nature of the Group, as well as the strength of the balance sheet, we continually assess the best risk adjusted opportunities to deploy capital to support shareholder returns.

# Capital allocation policy

# Invest in our organic growth

# Complement with value accretive acquisitions

# Provide a progressive dividend to shareholders

# Return excess cash to shareholders

We are continuing to invest in value accretive organic growth, with a focus on our people, technology and capability. This will be complemented by value accretive bolt-on acquisitions in time, following strengthened delivery and performance of our US platform and growth of Avantis.

Reflecting our confidence in the future prospects of the business, we have increased the growth rate of our progressive dividend from  $5\%$  to  $7\%$  and are returning excess cash to shareholders through the £100m share buyback programme announced in January.

Our strengthened balance sheet provides optionality for investment in growth and further shareholders returns.

# Sustainability

In delivering our strategy, the single biggest contributor will be our people. Their safety, wellbeing and motivation is essential for our success.

We measure employee engagement each quarter and I was delighted that at the end of this year we achieved our highest ever employee engagement measure since introducing this metric five years ago. Since its introduction we have improved employee engagement by  $19\%$  and the loyalty measure by  $25\%$ , a fantastic achievement and symbolic of the inclusive culture we are growing.

We were deeply saddened by the fatal crash involving two aircrew on-board one of our PC-9 aircraft in the Neuenstein area of Germany whilst on a customer training exercise in September 2023. Our thoughts remain with the families and close colleagues. Although the formal investigations into this accident are ongoing, we do not believe that there was any contributory fault by the company.

We continue to make good progress on our Net Zero plan. Our Scope 1 and 2 emissions have now reduced by  $33\%$  against our re-baseline FY20 base year, including a  $c.8\%$  reduction in FY24, whilst some elements of our Scope 3 emissions, such as business travel, have increased as we have grown globally. With our strong focus on our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) agenda, we are ranked as one of the top ESG companies in the defence and security sector by Sustainability and we have retained our AA rating from MSCI.

# Leadership changes

At the start of April, we announced that Carol Borg, Group CFO, and the Board together agreed that Carol would step down from her role. The Board and I were delighted to announce the appointment of Martin Cooper as Group CFO. Martin is a qualified chartered accountant with more than 25 years' experience leading multi-disciplinary teams in senior finance roles and is expected to join QinetiQ no later than October. To enable a smooth transition prior to Martin joining, Heather Cashin, previously Group Financial Controller, has been appointed Interim Group CFO.

Also in April, I was delighted to announce the appointment of Iain Stevenson to the newly created role of Chief Operating Officer. As an experienced senior business leader having previously led large business divisions in the defence and construction sectors, his skills will strengthen the delivery of consistent operational performance across the Group as we continue to scale and grow.

Finally, I was extremely pleased to confirm the internal promotion of Will Blamey to Chief Executive UK Defence. Will has played a critical role leading the successful development and delivery of major programmes, such as the LTPA.

These appointments will add strength and depth to our leadership team and further enhance our capabilities to execute our plan for sustainable growth.

# FY25 guidance increased and on-track to deliver FY27 outlook

We enter FY25 with strong momentum, a healthy order book and increased visibility, with  $64\%$  revenue under contract. We expect FY25 to deliver high single-digit organic revenue growth, compared to FY24, at a stable operating profit margin.

We are on-track to achieve c£2.4bn organic revenue at c.12% margin by FY27.

5: Compound annual growth rate

This will deliver an attractive return on capital employed at or above the upper end of the  $15 - 20\% +$  range.

Cash conversion will remain high at  $90\%+$ , with capital expenditure within the £90m to £120m range. Our strengthened balance sheet provides optionality, through disciplined deployment of capital, for bolt-on acquisitions to compound growth at 11-12% margin and further shareholder returns.

# Summary

I am pleased with the significant progress we have made in FY24, delivering another year of strong Group operational and financial performance with stronger growth in EMEA Services and stable performance in Global Solutions. The company is well positioned with a clear strategy, underpinning our confidence in delivering sustainable growth and attractive returns for our shareholders.

Our strategy and distinctive offerings are uniquely relevant to our customers' mission within the current heightened threat environment. Everything we do is about delivering on our purpose: protecting lives by serving the national security interests of our customers. Our purpose continues to connect us all, giving us a sense of focus, direction and pride. We look forward to continuing to deliver for the benefit of all our stakeholders in the coming years.

# Themes driving market growth

# Themes reshaping defence markets around the world

We are operating in an environment where there is an increasing threat of wider global conflict. This follows Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine; the threat posed by China's growing military power, coupled with its push to change global norms and potentially threaten its neighbours; and the Israel-Hamas conflict increasing further tension in the Middle East and threatening wider escalation in the region. These conflicts and ongoing tensions come at a time when many countries are holding national elections and this could potentially compound global uncertainty.

In parallel, rapidly emerging and evolving technologies continue to disrupt traditional business and society with both positive and negative outcomes including the creation of unprecedented vulnerabilities.

To meet these increasing challenges, Australia, the UK, the US and their allies continue to review their evolving defence and security capabilities and are increasing spending in high-priority areas aligned with our strategy.

# How are defence and security markets changing?

# Rising global tensions and increasingly complex threats

The threat environment continues to become increasingly complex, fuelled by rapid advances in technology and heightened geo-political tensions. From hypersonic missiles and advanced fighter jets to low-cost consumer drones adapted to cause harm, technological advances have enhanced the lethality of threats at both ends of the spectrum, giving both state and non-state actors access to capabilities that have the potential to undermine Western superiority. In addition, digital-based threats continue to grow in sophistication and are often deployed in conjunction with more conventional capabilities.

# Need for advanced capabilities, information advantage and better inter-operability

Maintaining technological superiority is critical in this increasingly complex threat environment. Our customers are investing heavily in R&D to develop next-generation capabilities and ensure informational advantage. Areas such as robotics, autonomy advanced data analytics, artificial intelligence and novel weapons are all of particular interest to our customers. These new and emerging technologies must be integrated with traditional defence capabilities, and across our markets, there is a need for greater inter-operability between platforms and systems to enhance operational effectiveness. This extends to the need for greater co-operation between different forces and nations to ensure a concerted effort in countering these modern threats.

# Resilience of supply chains

In light of the growing tension and competition between global powers, nations are increasingly focused on developing resilient domestic supply chains. These supply chains must demonstrate the agility, breadth and depth of capability to respond to changing and complex customer requirements. This is a critical part of maintaining capability that can function without undue reliance on international trade, expertise or raw materials from potentially hostile states.

# How are we addressing these market dynamics?

# Delivering disruptive science, engineering and technology required to modernise defence and security capabilities

QinetiQ was founded on innovation with research, development, test and evaluation at the core of what we do. As a predominantly service-based business, we are uniquely placed to operate across the breadth of platforms, systems and lifecycles, unlike a more traditional vertical platform manufacturer. We experiment, innovate and develop new capabilities, drawing on a broad range of existing, emerging and disruptive technologies. We emulate advanced threats and test and evaluate the resilience and inter-operability of systems and platforms used to respond to these threats, to provide assurance.

# Partnering for innovation

The capabilities our customers require can often be so complex that no one company can deliver them alone. In addition, cutting-edge technology is often found in the commercial sector and academia. The defence industry can benefit from leveraging this technology, but it needs new and more effective partnerships to convert emerging technologies rapidly into assured deployable capability. We collaborate across the supply chain, but also form partnerships with organisations outside of defence to provide the agility and expertise required to innovate at pace. Our ability to work across platforms and technologies and form powerful partnerships helps deliver mission-led innovation to our customers.

# A multi-domestic strategy

Our multi-domestic strategy is aimed at developing sovereign defence capabilities within the countries in which we operate. The focus for growth is in our three home countries, Australia, the UK and US, where we are pursuing similar opportunities to support their shared defence and security missions. The formation of the AUKUS alliance between these nations reinforces our multiDomestic strategy and makes us increasingly relevant. We are well positioned to deliver strong growth in the Australian, UK and US businesses in the next five years.

//Our customers seek to rapidly modernise their defence and security capabilities so they can better address current and future threats. //

In 2024, the Australian Government released the inaugural National Defence Strategy and Integrated Investment Program complementing the 2023 Defence Strategic Review. Recognising that the current environment demands a new approach to defending its national interests, there is a commitment to invest in conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines through a partnership between Australia, the UK and the US (AUKUS), alongside deepening cooperation on a range of advanced security and defence capabilities. The Defence Industry Development Strategy (DIDS) now articulates the defence industrial base required with Test and Evaluation, Certification and Systems Assurance (TECSA) forming one of the seven Sovereign Defence Industrial Priorities.

The consolidated Defence and Australian Signals Directorate funding for FY24/25 is estimated at AUD $55.3bn<sup>1</sup>. In April 2024, the Australian Government announced that it will increase defence spending by $50.3bn over the next decade, hitting $100bn by 2033, or c.2.4% of GDP.

# Trading environment

A more contested and volatile international environment has reinforced the UK Government's commitment to increased defence spending. In April, the UK Government announced an incremental £75bn of defence spending over six years, with defence spending set to rise to  $2.5\%$  of GDP by the end of the decade - reaching £87bn a year in 2030. The Government states that "additional funding will be used to put the UK's defence industry on a war footing, deliver cutting-edge technology and back Ukraine against Russia". The new spending plan comes with a promise to spend at least  $5\%$  of the budget on R&D from next year, and another  $2\%$  to "support the exploitation of promising science and technology in military capability".

As the UK seeks to develop and deploy next-generation capabilities faster than its adversaries, we are well positioned to support our customers in applying mission-led innovation to achieve this.

# Financial performance

Orders increased  $7 \%$ excluding the 10 year £260m MSCA order in FY23. Including MSCA in the strong FY23 comparator, orders decreased by  $13 \%$  (organic and reported). The funded order backlog excluding LTPA ended the year at £1.4bn, with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.04x (FY23: 1.17x, excluding MSCA). There has been an increase in orders through the Engineering Delivery Partner (EDP) framework totalling £472m in FY24 (FY23: £404m), as well as an increase in the German business, which secured a significant, multi- year aerial training services contract, representing the single largest and longest contract award within our Threat Representation business.

Revenue increased by  $20\%$  to  $\mathbb{E}1,417.4\mathrm{m}$  (FY23:  $\mathbb{E}1,179.3\mathrm{m})$  , and grew by  $19\%$  on an organic basis, as a result of good growth in the UK, underpinned by new work as part of the EDP framework and a variation of price uplift on the LTPA.

At the beginning of FY25, we had £1.0bn of EMEA Services' FY25 revenue under contract, compared to £0.8bn (of the FY24 revenue) at the same point last year.

Underlying operating profit grew by  $19\%$  to  $\mathbb{E}163.4\mathrm{m}$  (FY23:  $\mathbb{E}137.1\mathrm{m}$ ) in line with revenue growth. Operating margin remained stable at  $11.5\%$ .

Approximately  $66\%$  of EMEA Services revenue is derived from single-source contracts (FY23: approximately  $64\%$ ). By investing in our core contracts and extending their duration the high proportion of single-source revenue contracted on a long-term basis provides visibility and reduces our exposure to future changes in the baseline profit rate set annually by the Single Source Regulations Office.

# Financial performance

Orders increased by  $56\%$  to  $\mathbb{L}547.3\mathrm{m}$  (FY23:  $\mathbb{E}351.9\mathrm{m}$ ),  $7 \%$  organically. This was driven by a growing order intake in the targets business and good order intake in the Avantus business.

Revenue was up  $23\%$  on a reported basis at £494.7m (FY23: £401.4m) due to the full-year impact of the Avantus acquisition. There was a small organic decline of  $3\%$ , with Avantus delivering high single digit revenue decline over the course of the year, but achieving positive revenue growth in the second half.

Revenue in the rest of Global Solutions was broadly flat for the year, impacted by the loss of the Optionally manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV) opportunity. We also saw the planned production ramp down of the Common Robotic System - Individual (CRS-I) small ground robots in the US, offset by the highest ever production levels in QinetiQ Target Systems (QTS) in the UK.

At the beginning of FY25, we have  $52\%$  of Global Solutions' FY25 revenue under contract, compared to  $44\%$  (of the FY24 revenue) at the same

point last year. In addition, we have a further \(150m of US contract awards in FY24, which are expected to be funded during FY25. This would increase revenue cover to 75% in FY25.

Underlying operating profit increased to £51.8 (FY23: £41.8m) due to the full-year impact of the Avantis acquisition, with a stable underlying operating profit margin of  $10.5\%$  (FY23:  $10.4\%$ ). Organically, operating profit increased by  $6\%$ , driven by improved margins in the US business.

//In my first year at QinetiQ, it has been great to learn and confirm the potential of the Australia Sector. We have a clear plan to expand our capabilities and relevance to our Australian and international customers, with a truly global team of 1,200 people operating in Australia, Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom.//

# Overview

During the year we established a new leadership team, implemented an integrated operating model, adapted to the new Australian defence policy and priorities, and completed the integration of Air Affairs. Tragically, we lost two of our experienced and long-serving German pilots in a fatal aircraft crash while delivering training for the German military.

# Order Highlights

The sector has performed well throughout the year. Order intake was impacted due to Australian customer delays arising from the Defence Strategic Review. However, we secured a number of strategic and long term orders, that position us well for the future.

- Our Advisory business obtained a significant, multi-year extension to deliver professional and technical services to major defence capability programmes in vehicles, maritime warfare, guided weapons, explosive ordnance, and aerospace surveillance and reconnaissance.  
- Our German operation secured a significant, multi-year aerial training services contract, representing the single largest and longest contract award within our Threat Representation business.  
- Our Canadian target systems operation entered an agreement with the Royal Canadian Navy and Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC) to develop and supply a new Uncrewed Surface Vehicle. Joining the existing maritime target portfolio, this new multi-role boat will also feature remote autonomous operation with crewed and uncrewed functionality.

# Operational Highlights

We continued to see demand for our technical engineering and advisory services in Australia, and global demand for our portfolio of aerial and maritime targets and mission rehearsal services. Notable operational highlights for the year include:

- Our UK target systems operation manufactured and delivered over 600 aerial targets, representing a  $50\%$  increase in volume.

- Our Engineering business invested in state-of-the-art facilities to support business growth. In Melbourne we established the QinetiQ Technology and Engineering Centre (QTEC), delivering a complex vehicle project for the Australian Army. In Adelaide we opened QLabs providing critical capability in Directed Energy Weapons with the Department of Defence.  
- Our MakerSpace programme added additional sites, helping the Australian Army create a culture of digital thinking and innovation.  
- Substantial progress was made integrating the Air Affairs business acquired in December 2022. Now named QinetiQ Air Affairs (QAA), over the last year it was transformed from a local Australian specialist business into a key pillar of QinetiQ's global threat representation offering. QAA's achievements in FY24 have included participation in a number of international defence exercises and development of new training targets.

# QinetiQ Target Systems (QTS)

Demand for QTS products led to the highest production levels ever during FY24. QTS will achieve the significant production milestone of 10,000 Banshee and 750 Hammerhead targets during FY25 and continues to innovate to meet the changing customer training needs and evolving threats.

QTS continues to make positive progress with customers such as the US Department of Defence, recently providing test and evaluation capabilities utilising the Rattler supersonic target to support the development of defensive high energy lasers in response to emerging and evolving threats.

QTS has delivered multi-domain threat representation, utilising both uncrewed aerial and maritime surface targets to present a realistic threat scenario for warships on pre-deployment training.

In Germany, QTS, working in collaboration with QinetiQ Germany as part of the newly established Threat Representation Business Unit, has delivered target services in support of the training and deployment of anti-aircraft systems.

# Case study

# QinetiQ's multi-faceted contribution to regional security training

A range of offerings from QinetiQ Air Affairs were employed for Exercise Talisman Sabre 2023, the major military exercise involving Australia, the United States, along with their allies and regional partners.

QAA's Learjet capability was engaged to support various maritime strike operations. Learjet crews also flew threat representation profiles as aerial opposing forces from Darwin.

In a first in Australia, QAA's Remotely Piloted Aerial Target team carried out a number of Phoenix aerial target operations for the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force. Phoenix targets were used for radar tracking trials in preparation for the firing of a Type 12 Surface-to-Ship missile. Additional Phoenix target flights supported Surface-to-Air missile firings.

Finally, QAA provided a range of Learjet and helicopter aeromedical services to support military personnel participating in the exercise, with aircraft based in Weipa, Townsville and Bradshaw Range for rapid response evacuation support flights.

//QAA's engagement for Exercise Talisman Sabre 23 demonstrated the role we have in supporting a secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific region through our specialist capability in multi-domain threat representation and other aviation support functions.//

//The UK Defence Sector has delivered a very successful year providing greater value and operational advantage to our customers in an increasingly challenging threat environment. //

# Overview

The UK Defence Sector delivers mission critical solutions, innovating for our Air, Maritime and Land customers' advantage. The distinctive offerings across our customer base have delivered good revenue growth this year, whilst sustaining strong cash conversion and operating profit. Framework partnerships remain central to how we deliver customer value, with the EDP contract alone delivering over £1.5bn of orders in its first five years. Following a Principles Agreement with UK MOD for an extension option to jointly develop the LTPA test, trials, training and evaluation (T3E) capabilities beyond 2028, future prospects are well underpinned.

# Test, Trials, Training & Evaluation (T3E)

Over three weeks in May 2023 at MOD Hebrides, we hosted Formidable Shield 23, one of the world's largest and most complex multi-domain tests of naval and missile defences. Operated by QinetiQ, the exercise saw over 20 ships, 35 aircraft, and nearly 4,000 allied military personnel from 13 NATO nations come together to test missiles, systems, sensors and software against representative threat scenarios in realistic live-fire mission rehearsal exercises.

We have secured significant orders to increase environmental testing capacity in support of the UK's Weapons stockpile resilience effort, and for further work at our Hurn vehicle testing capability. We delivered a complex synthetic training demonstration from Portsdown Technology Park delivering collective training to three platforms docked at HM Naval Base in Portsmouth: HMS Queen Elizabeth, HMS Diamond and HMS Kent. This ability to train across multiple geographically dispersed units provides a step change in capability to the Navy.

# Engineering Services

Demand remains strong for engineering services across a broad range of programmes, primarily as the Engineering Delivery Partner for MOD. Key achievements this year include securing:

- An initial task as Capability Partner in support of the new AUKUS submarine programme, and a greater role supplying specialist design services;

Supply of further technical support services to the DE&S Catalyst delivery team for the Future Combat Air System (FCAS) programme;  
- The Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) funded Modular Integrated Protection System programme developing a new pan-fleet active protection system architecture for British Army vehicles.

# Science and Technology

We have also been working closely with DE&S in support of the new acquisition reforms and investing in our enabling digital toolsets to deliver increased customer value from our engineering services.

In collaboration with Dstl, MBDA and Leonardo, we achieved the UK's first high-power firing of a Laser Directed Energy Weapon (LDEW) against aerial targets. This was an important step forward demonstrating the capabilities of QinetiQ's world-leading beam combining laser technology, and development of the enabling Test & Evaluation capability. The MOD has recently announced that the cutting-edge DragonFire laser directed energy weapon system will be installed on Royal Navy warships for the first time from 2027, far sooner than previously envisaged.

We also delivered the UK's first jet-to-jet crewed-uncrewed-teaming demonstration in March 2024 working in partnership with Dstl, the Royal Navy and the Air and Space Warfare Centre as part of the UK's Accelerating Air Autonomy Capability Experimentation programme. The trial showcased human machine teaming between a crewed aircraft and an autonomous drone; the UK's first jet-to-jet crewed-uncrewed-teaming demonstration.

During the 2023 NATO Robotic Experimentation Prototyping Augmented by Maritime Unmanned Systems (REPMUS) Exercise, we supported the Royal Navy leading a UK team delivering the experimental Command & Control exercises for the missio management of multiple uncrewed vehicles across a task group.

//The UK Intelligence Sector continues to serve as a key trusted partner to the UK Government, across the defence and national security mission. This is reflected in our strong financial performance during FY24, and will position us for further growth as the need for our C5ISTAR, training, & digital intelligence mission critical capabilities, to support customer operations, are continually in demand. //

# Overview

The UK Intelligence Sector utilises its unique domain knowledge across C5iSTAR (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance), allied to its research, innovation and applied engineering pedigree, to support UK Government in the development, assurance, integration and deployment of mission critical capabilities at pace. We are a key industry partner to the MOD, and continue to be well-placed to deliver critical digital change programmes over the coming years to Defence Digital (DD), Defence Intelligence (DI) and Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl).

Within the year, highlights include:

- SOCIETAS – An £80m transformation programme focused on accelerating the production of mission data, enabling the UK's military platforms and personnel to be better protected in a rapidly changing threat landscape. SOCIETAS continues to perform beyond expectations with the Full Operating Capability declared three months early.  
- The establishment of the Training and Simulation Centre of Excellence at Farnborough providing increased support to Land (Army Virtual Proving Ground), Maritime (Type 23 and Type 45 training simulation systems) and the RAF, Dstl and secure cyber domains. This business area is growing strongly, achieving  $30\%$  revenue growth on prior year.  
- New Style of IT (Deployed) (NSOITD) - We have continued our strong and enduring relationship with Defence Digital's successful NSOITD programme for over five years to a value of £107m, and have now secured another 12 months of support. Our offering enables the agile delivery of the nodes across Design, Engineering, Test and Integration and through engineering support to the Live Services.

# Operational highlights

We continue to demonstrate our ability to leverage our acquisitions for future success. Fully acquired in 2020, Naimuri demonstrated strong year-on-year orders growth exceeding  $80\%$ , and headcount growth to c.200 employees in the same time frame. Naimuri's portfolio has significantly diversified beyond National Security into Homeland Security, and UK MOD. Amongst the new orders were two sizeable three year contracts in Homeland Security, delivering two strategic aims: i) diversification of Naimuri's customer base; and ii) increase to the longevity of contracts. Naimuri continues to be cited as an example of a high-performing SME working on the highest priority Government systems and highly engaged in supporting social values and growth as part of the Northern Powerhouse.

UK Intelligence continues to evolve to ensure we have the capabilities and expertise in emerging technologies e.g. quantum technology. This is an emerging and disruptive capability covering quantum sensing, navigation and computing. We are building the capability through a mixture of internal investment and customer projects, and ensuring alignment with the UK's National Quantum Technology Programme.

Finally, we remain committed to providing operational support to the UK Government including 24/7 support to operations and deployment throughout this difficult period in Eastern Europe, which has enabled UK platforms to support burden sharing with allies, assisting with military aid provision.

# Rapid Innovation Cell within the Defence Intelligence Pillar

The Defence Intelligence Pillar (DI Pillar) was established over two years ago, and since its establishment has generated over £97m in revenue, of which £26.6m is focused on the Rapid Innovation Cell (RIC). The DI Pillar now encompasses 12 different thematic areas critical to DI. The Rapid Innovation Capability offers UK MOD a route to deliver exploitable innovation at pace. We are currently delivering approximately 30 commissions for a range of Defence customers, and across a range of technical and non-technical domains including the piloting of a reprogramming node at RNAS Yeovilton.

//As we've seen from the diversity of RIC users, the utility can extend beyond delivery of isolated innovation commissions, moving towards supporting in the wider delivery of the MOD's innovation strategy. This may include sharing of best practice, supporting triage of ideas with relevant technical input and aiding the evolution of innovation into operational capability.//

# //The integration of Avantus generated positive momentum in the order book and sets the foundation to deliver mission led innovation in support of our customers' most critical mission needs. //

# Overview

Our US Sector provides design, development, rapid prototyping, systems engineering and integration and manufacture of speciality defence mission products and solutions related to robotics, autonomy, maritime and sensors. The integration of Avantus provided a complementary suite of services related to mission support, modernisation, enablement and operations, technical advisory, cyber, information advantage for US Defense, Federal, Homeland and National Security customers.

# Order and Operational Highlights

The US Sector had  $1.3bn of total contract awards during the year, including$ 977m from Avantus. We have completed the integration of Avantus into a single operating model for the Sector and expect to benefit from market and operational synergies.

We won a $223m, five year, firm fixed price contract with the US Space Development Agency (SDA) to provide systems engineering and technical assistance support needed to deliver the Proliferated Space Warfare Architecture, a threat-driven constellation of small satellites that deliver critical services to our warfighters from space. Services include tracking of advanced missile threats, low-latency data transport integrated with tactical data links, custody of time-critical land and maritime targets, and space-based battle management. During the autumn, our team supported SDA's successful demonstration of the first-ever Link 16 space to ground transmission.

We won a $126m, five year, hybrid firm fixed price contract to provide technical, professional, and administrative support services to the Office of the Secretary of Defense Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO). This award builds upon our existing work within SCO and supports SCO's mission to analyse and accelerate the development, demonstration, and transition of capabilities to counter strategic adversaries and improve the United States security posture in peacetime, crisis, and conflict.

We won a $170m, five year, firm fixed price Tethered Aerostat Radar System (TARS) Operations & Maintenance contract with the US Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection and Air and Marine Operations. The team provides persistent surveillance operations and sustainment services at eight sites along the southern border of the United States and territories, spanning from Arizona to Puerto Rico. Services include, air-surface radar operations, ground control and data networking systems monitoring, and data fusion and analysis as an integral part of the mission to detect, sort, intercept, track, and apprehend criminals in diverse environments at and beyond the US borders.

We secured $2.7m of incremental funding on an existing contract to build and test the Electromechanical Actuator Power Conditioner and Controller (EPCC) for ten shipsets for the Virginia class submarine programme as an extension of our previous design and development effort. The EPCC is a rack of hardware and software designed to control precision actuators as part of the weapon stowage and handling system. In FY24, we have successfully delivered the first two shipsets.

We won a five year indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract for $83m to deliver the Program of Record Next Generation Advanced Bomb Suit (NGABS) for Product Manager Soldier Protective Equipment. QinetiQ's technology increases the situational awareness through advancement in its low/no light operation integrated capability provided by a Modular Sensor Suite and Heads Up Display.

Another year of strong cash generation has enabled us to return additional capital to shareholders.

# Strong organic growth at stable margins

The Group has delivered strong growth and underlying performance across all metrics, reflecting continued disciplined execution of our strategy.

Consistently strong cash generation contributed to net debt to EBITDA falling to 0.5x (FY23: 0.8x). We have increased the growth rate of our progressive dividend from  $5\%$  to  $7\%$ , growing the distribution to 8.25p per share (FY23: 7.70p).

The Group achieved record orders in the year, totalling £1,740.4m (FY23: £1,724.1m), a year-on-year 1% increase and a book-to-bill of 1.1x. This is on the back of a very strong prior-year comparator, which included the 10 year £260m Maritime Strategic Capability Agreement (MSCA) contract. Excluding the MSCA contract, orders were up 19%; orders declined 10% organically with MSCA included. We have secured major orders across both of our operating segments. Within EMEA Services we secured £1,193m of orders, including a £54m variation of price uplift to the LTPA, a £39m extension to our Battlefield and Tactical

Communications & Information Systems (BATCIS) contract and a significant multi-year aerial training services contract in Germany.

Within Global Solutions, FY24 orders were £547m, a 56% increase on a reported basis and 7% organic. The drivers of this performance are an 18% increase in our QTS business to £68m, together with a significant increase in funded orders through the US business as a result of the Avantus acquisition in FY23.

In the US, the total value of contract awards was \(1.3bn. Of this, \)571m has been funded and is reported within the Global Solutions order intake. The remaining \(729m represents unfunded orders, which are contract awards for which funding has not yet been appropriated or authorised.

Highlights include a  $46m funded order for our Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) and Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG) systems for the US Navy's CVN 81 aircraft carrier, and a five year contract worth$ 83m for the Next Generation Advanced Bomb Suit (NGABS) ( $34m funded and$ 49m unfunded). We secured contract awards for a five year contract with the Secretary of Defense Strategic Capabilities Office

1 Book-to-bill ratio is orders won divided by revenue recognised, excluding LTPA revenue of £266m (FY23: £225m)  
2 MSCA 10 year £260m contract in FY23

(SCO) for \(126m (\)14m funded and $112m unfunded), a \(223m contract award for Space Development Agency (SDA) support (\(43m funded and \)180m unfunded), and a five year Tethered AeroStat Radar System (TARS) Operations & Maintenance contract with a total contract value of \(170m (\)16m funded and $154m unfunded).

Funded order backlog remains strong at £2.9bn, or £3.7bn including unfunded orders, providing good visibility going forward:

- In EMEA Services the total funded order backlog was £2.6bn (FY23: 2.8bn). The reduction in the backlog is due to the delivery of non-tasking revenue (c.£266m per annum) within the Long-term Partnering Agreement (LTPA). This is a large multi-year contract that was booked in prior years and as we deliver this will naturally reduce the LTPA order backlog. Outside of the LTPA, backlog has remained broadly stable at £1.4bn (FY23: £1.5bn).  
- In Global Solutions the total funded order backlog grew from £302m in FY23 to £321m in FY24. Our US unfunded order backlog grew from $245m to $974m driven by the contracts referenced above.

At the beginning of FY25 approximately £1.3bn of the Group's FY25 revenue was under contract, compared to £1.1bn (of the FY24 revenue) at the same point last year. In addition, it is anticipated that $150m of unfunded orders will be funded during FY25.  
We delivered strong revenue growth of 21% to £1,912.1m (FY23: £1,580.7m), 14% on an organic basis, demonstrating increasing demand for our six distinctive offerings. We saw a 19% organic revenue increase in EMEA Services primarily due to good growth in the UK, underpinned by new work as part of the EDP framework (delivering 28% revenue growth within the framework) and a variation of price uplift on the LTPA. Global Solutions revenue decreased by 3% organically with Avantus delivering high single digit revenue decline over the course of the year. Revenue in the rest of Global Solutions was broadly flat for the year, impacted by the loss of the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV) opportunity. We also saw the planned production ramp down of the Common Robotic System - Individual (CRS-I) small ground robots in the US from  $40.2m in FY23 to$ 13.8m in FY24, offset by the highest ever production levels in QinetiQ Target Systems (QTS) in the UK.

Operating profit from segments of £215.2m (FY23: £178.9m) was up  $20\%$ . This represents a stable  $11.3\%$  operating margin (FY23:  $11.3\%$ ), consistent with our guidance range of  $11 - 12\%$ . The largest contributions to year-on-year growth were the full-year impact of the Avantus acquisition and organic revenue growth at stable operating margin in EMEA Services.

To ensure consistency and clarity on our headline profit figures, our headline profit figure remains as operating profit from segments and excludes any benefit arising from RDEC income (which was previously reported within the tax line prior to FY23). Statutory operating profit was £192.5m (FY23: £172.8m), including the impact of specific adjusting items and RDEC income. Underlying RDEC income increased to £27.2m (FY23: £17.4m) due to the increase in the applicable rate.

Underlying profit before tax increased  $16\%$  to  $\mathbb{£}27.0\mathrm{m}$  (FY23:  $\mathbb{£}189.7\mathrm{m})$  in line with the increase in underlying operating profit, with underlying net finance expense at  $\mathbb{£}15.4\mathrm{m}$  (FY23:  $\mathbb{£}6.6\mathrm{m})$  .Underlying net finance expense increased due to the full-year impact of interest payable on the term loan drawn down to fund the Avantus acquisition.

# Specific adjusting items

The total impact of specific adjusting items (which are excluded from underlying performance due to their distorting nature) on operating profit was a £49.9m cost (FY23: cost of £23.5m).

Acquisition and disposal costs of £2.7m (FY23: £16.4m) comprises costs associated with an aborted acquisition attempt during the year, as well as a number of ongoing disposal projects. Acquisition-related remuneration relates to specific post-deal retention arrangements relating to Avantis employees. Acquisition integration costs of £5.3m (FY23: £2.0m) comprises costs associated with the Avantis and Air Affairs acquisitions which were completed in H2 of FY23.

We continue to deliver on our discrete investment project to build our digital platform to enable our global growth strategy and our AUKUS customers' needs. The project runs for a further three years and we expect an additional c.£35m of non-recurring costs to be reported as specific adjusting items in the P&L, with ongoing recurring operating costs (such as licence costs and overheads) remaining within underlying operating costs. In FY24 the non-recurring cost of the digital investment project was £16.9m (FY23: £5.8m).

FY23 included exceptional restructuring costs of £5.0m, as part of the significant Group-wide organisation redesign, and a £19.6m credit in respect of UK MOD appropriation for RDEC, following a determination by the Single Source Regulations Office on the interpretation of the Statutory Guidance for Allowable Costs regulations. The accounting judgement remains that RDEC on single-source contracts from 1 April 2019 onwards will not be paid on to the UK MOD, which was a change from the accounting judgement at the FY22 year end.

Also included within specific adjusting items are a gain on the sale of property of £2.1m (FY23: £2.0m), financing income from pensions of £5.6m (FY23: £9.9m), impairment of right-of-use lease assets in the US following space relocation of £0.7m, and amortisation of acquisition intangibles of £25.2m (FY23: £15.6m). Amortisation of acquisition intangibles has increased due to the amortisation of new intangible assets recognised on the FY23 acquisitions (primarily the Customer Relationships asset associated with Avantis). FY23 also included a gain on disposal of the Space NV business in Belgium of £15.9m.

# Cash management and capital allocation policy

Working capital management and overall cash performance has remained robust, with a particularly strong performance in the second half.

Underlying net cash flow from operations was £320.2m (FY23: £270.1m). Our cash conversion definition reflects our pre-capital expenditure cash flows as a proportion of EBITDA to demonstrate how we convert our profit (excluding interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) into cash flow - under this definition we achieved consistent underlying cash conversion of  $104\%$ , (FY23:  $106\%$ ).

As at 31 March 2024 the Group had £151.2m net debt, reduced from £206.9m as at 31 March 2023 due to the strong operating cash conversion during the year. During the year, we have successfully reduced leverage to 0.5x (31 March 2023: 0.8x).

Through FY24 we have demonstrated our capital allocation policy in action:

Invest in our organic growth - net capital expenditure of £96.1m (FY23: £109.0m), focused on contractual commitments (39% relating to customer funded contracts including £37m into the LTPA), sustainment of the portfolio and investment to support future growth  
- Complement with value accretive acquisitions - successful integration of Avantus and Air Affairs with focus on proving delivery performance and growth  
- Provide a progressive dividend to shareholders - increase in the year-on-year growth rate from  $5\%$  to  $7\%$  
- Return of excess cash to shareholders – £100m share buyback programme, with £16m completed by the end of March

The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.

1 Other movements driven by share based payments, pensions impacts and provision movements

# Tax

The total tax charge was £43.1m (FY23: £37.6m). The underlying tax charge was £57.4m (FY23: £36.8m), on a higher underlying profit before tax, with an underlying effective tax rate of 25.3% for the year ending 31 March 2024 (FY23: 19.4%), increased from the prior year due to the change in UK statutory rate. The underlying effective tax rate is above the UK statutory rate of 25% (FY23:19%) primarily as a result of higher overseas tax rates and non-deductible overseas interest, offset by prior year adjustments to returns.

The underlying effective tax rate is expected to remain marginally above the UK statutory rate, subject to the impact of any tax legislation changes and the geographic mix of profits. The Group has engaged with advisers to assess any potential impact on the tax charge by the UK's enactment of the OECD's Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (Pillar Two). The Group performed an assessment of the potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes based on current period data. The Group understands it qualifies for one of the transitional safe harbours provided in the rules in all territories in which it operates. Therefore, the Group does not anticipate a material impact from Pillar Two legislation in the near future. The Group has applied the temporary exemption issued by the International Accounting Standards Board from the accounting for deferred taxes under IAS12 and neither recognises nor discloses information about deferred taxes related to Pillar Two income taxes. The Group does not anticipate a material quantitative impact from Pillar Two legislation, however, there are expected to be significant compliance obligations.

# Committed facilities

The Group has a £336m Term Loan split into two tranches: GBP Term Loan £273m (Tranche A); and, USD Term Loan £63m (Tranche B), which will mature on 27 September 2026 and has a one year option to extend the final maturity to 27 September 2027. In line with Group policy, £270m (c.80%) of the floating rate debt has been fixed using SONIA interest rate swaps split over a three year and five year tenure at a weighted average rate of 3.29%. Including all fees and charges, the weighted average cost of debt is 5.21%.

At the year-end, the Group had a £275m bank revolving credit facility with an additional 'accordion' facility to increase the limit up to £400m. The facility was due to mature on 27 September 2025 and was undrawn at 31 March 2024. The facility was refinanced on 22 April

2024 and replaced with a new £290m facility, which will mature on 22 April 2027. It has two one year extension options to extend the final maturity date to 22 April 2029. It provides the Group with significant scope to execute its strategic growth plans.

The Group adopts a strict policy on managing counterparty risk through a combination of diversification of investments and regular reviews of counterparty limits using credit rating assessments. We are proud that our debt sits with our key relationship banks who have strong credit-ratings and diverse portfolios, demonstrating their resilience. The banks have been selected for their capabilities in our home countries to support our business.

# Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)

To help understand the overall return profile of the Group, we continue to report our Return on Capital Employed, using the calculation of: profit from segments less underlying amortisation / (average capital employed less net pension asset), where average capital employed is defined as shareholders' equity plus net debt (or minus net cash).

For FY24 Group ROCE was  $21\%$  (FY23:  $23\%$ ), modestly lower due to the full-year impact of the increased capital employed with the acquisitions completed in the prior year. As we continue to invest in our business to support sustainable long-term growth, our ROCE is forecast to remain attractive, at or above the upper end of the  $15 - 20\%+$  range, excluding the impact of any further acquisitions.

# Earnings per share

Underlying basic earnings per share increased by  $11\%$  to 29.4p (FY23: 26.5p) driven by the higher underlying profit after tax. Basic earnings per share for the total Group (including specific adjusting items) reduced  $11\%$  to 24.2p (FY23: 26.8p), with the prior year including the gain on disposal of the Space NV business and the release of the liability for the MOD appropriation of RDEC.

The average number of shares in issue during the year, net of treasury shares and as used in the basic earnings per share calculations, was 577.0m (FY23: 575.9m). There were 573.5m shares in issue at 31 March 2024, reduced due to the ongoing share buyback.

# Dividend

The Board proposes a final FY24 dividend per share of 5.65p (FY23: 5.30p) making the full-year dividend 8.25p (FY23: 7.70p). The full-year dividend represents an increase in the Group's progressive dividend from  $5\%$  to  $7\%$ .

Subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting, the final FY24 dividend will be paid on 22nd August 2024 to shareholders on the register at 26th July 2024.

# Pensions

The triennial valuation of the Scheme was undertaken as at 30 June 2023 and resulted in an actuarially assessed surplus.

The net pension asset under IAS 19, before adjusting for deferred tax, was £18.4m (31 March 2023: £119.8m). The key driver for the decrease in the net pension asset since the March 2023 year end was an actuarial adjustment following recalibration of demographic and financial assumptions to the recently completed 30 June 2023 triennial valuation.

The next triennial valuation will be performed as at 30 June 2026. Under the new schedule of contributions agreed, and reflecting the Scheme being in surplus, there are no deficit reduction employer contributions required.

During the year the pension fund took out a loan of £125m to facilitate an increase in the level of hedging in place. This has increased the hedges to cover approximately 80% of the interest rate risk and 85% of the inflation rate risk as at 31 March 2024, as measured on the Trustees' gilt-funded basis. The loan will be repaid in tranches by FY27 using proceeds from the realisation of investments.

The key assumptions used in the IAS 19 valuation of the Scheme are set out in note 28.

# Net finance costs

Net finance expense was £9.8m (FY23: income of £3.3m). The underlying net finance expense was £15.4m (FY23: £6.6m), increased due to a full year of interest payable on the Avantus funding borrowings, with additional income of £5.6m (FY23: £9.9m) in respect of the defined benefit pension net surplus reported within specific adjusting items.

# Sustainability:

# Environmental, Social & Governance

2023 was the warmest year on record. We have also seen further conflict and the increased cost of living. It is clear that environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors are important to QinetiQ and to our stakeholders. Focusing on the safety, security and sustainability of the world around us is critical; everything we do at QinetiQ is about protecting what matters most.

# Strategy and materiality

Sustainability encompasses a broad range of ESG factors but not all are material to QinetiQ, to our sector or the communities in which we operate. It is therefore important that we are focused on what matters most to our business as it evolves and grows and we meet the expectations and the needs of our stakeholders. Delivering our sustainability strategy, based on key ESG material factors, ensures we are addressing risks and creating value for our shareholders and customers. It means we create a great place to work for our people and future workforce, protect the environment and have a positive impact in our communities. Our ESG framework (page 35) provides a high-level overview of these factors and we describe our progress and plans in this section (pages 34-53).

# External landscape

The changing external landscape and how we and our stakeholders need to respond continues to evolve. With 2023 recognised as the warmest year on record, the focus on climate change continues and that on biodiversity has further increased. Conflict and the cost of living have also been important drivers. The evolution of a range of new reporting requirements is shaping our programmes to ensure we are better able to

articulate the sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect QinetiQ's prospects over the short, medium or long term. To ensure we understand future requirements, we actively horizon scan and this year have invested in new tools to support us. We provide monthly updates to the ESG Steering Committee, chaired by our Group CEO, and regular updates in our ESG reports to the Board.

# Stakeholder engagement

A core driver for our focus is meeting the needs and expectations of our stakeholders, so regular engagement with them is vital. Throughout the year, we engage with shareholders, customers and employees about ESG directly, and via reporting, surveys and questionnaires, so we are able to listen, understand, and identify what matters most to them. We also track and share best practice through industry sustainability networks. We strive to be proactive, chairing a number of industry groups. We actively collaborate with customers, peers and suppliers on topics such as climate change, ethics, diversity and inclusion and skills.(see pages 39 and 55 for more details).

We recognise the importance of supporting national and international sustainability programmes and frameworks. Our Net-Zero targets are validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) (see page 36) and we support Race to Zero. We use the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a guide and remain committed to driving progress on specific goals that are aligned to our sustainability agenda.

Based on this approach, we believe that the aspects of sustainability that we are focusing on are the most material to our business and to our stakeholders, and our approach is to embed ESG into strategy, and our business processes.

In FY25 we will be focusing across all our programmes and looking further at non-financial data.

# Environmental

2023 was the warmest year on record. We have also seen the growing focus on degradation of natural habitats and the impact on biodiversity. Every business has a role to play and a duty of care to manage their environmental impact.

We actively play our part in the stewardship of the environment, by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, through our conservation activities and the solutions we offer to our customers to help meet their sustainability ambitions, while maintaining capability.

# Climate change

Transition to Net-Zero

QinetiQ is committed to reducing our contribution to climate change. Building on our environmental stewardship and reductions in Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, our journey to Net-Zero began in earnest in 2021, with the creation of a Climate Change Steering Group (CCSG), chaired by the Group CFO and attended by senior stakeholders from across the business. A commitment to setting science-based GHG emissions targets, and a Net-Zero Plan followed in early 2022, along with the creation of a permanent role for a Climate Change Programme Manager to lead the delivery of the key initiatives outlined in this Plan. In FY23, our ESG team transferred to the Finance & Governance function, to create a direct link to our Group CFO and consolidate closer alignment with key stakeholders across the QinetiQ Group. In the same year we introduced new metrics into our Leadership Incentive Scheme, tracking the

personal contribution of our senior leaders to our Net-Zero Plan and activities to reduce GHG emissions. The scheme was subsequently expanded to a wider leadership community and renamed the Annual Bonus Plan (page 118).

# Net-Zero target setting

QinetiQ has been collecting and reporting GHG emissions figures for many years, and we have evolved our methodologies in-line with the GHG Protocol. We have set emissions targets which cover our full value chain, across all categories of Scope 1, 2 and 3 and these were validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in 2022, confirmed as ambitious, and fully aligned to a  $1.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  global temperature pathway. Through SBTi validation, QinetiQ is a member of the SBTi Business Ambition for  $1.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  Campaign and the United Nations Race to Zero Campaign.

# SCIENCE BASED TARGETS

DRIVING AMBITIOUS CORPORATE CLIMATE ACTION

As outlined in our Net-Zero Plan, our Climate Change Programme is built on four key initiatives, which are summarised in the table below. Our goal is to focus on absolute reductions in emissions. Within our emissions targets we have made a commitment to at least a  $90\%$  reduction across our full value chain by 2050 or sooner. We recognise that eliminating all sources of emissions will be challenging with current technologies and so up to  $10\%$  of our footprint may need to be offset. We recognise that change is essential to meet our goals, but change can introduce risk, so we apply programme management rigour with a clear strategy and robust governance. Our Climate Change Programme has been designed to ensure appropriate governance across the QinetiQ Group, to facilitate and support transformational changes to our ways of working. A variety of scheduled reviews and briefings are undertaken to both the Group Director ESG and Group CFO throughout the year, with climate change an agenda item on the monthly ESG Steering Committee, chaired by the Group CEO. Regular progress updates are provided by stakeholder groups across the business, and these are presented in a simplified dashboard, allowing progress to be captured and any areas of concern to be highlighted and resolved.

# GHG emissions methodology

Our methodology for calculating our GHG emissions is aligned to the GHG Protocol, and best practice outlined by the SBTi. We are constantly striving to improve our calculations, to obtain a more accurate indication of our emissions. To be transparent about our approach, we publish our methodology documentation on our website.

www.qinetiq.com/en/our-company/sustainability/climate-change

Net-Zero targets  

<table><tr><td></td><td>FY20</td><td>FY30</td><td>FY50 or sooner</td></tr><tr><td>Scopes 1&amp;2</td><td>Base year</td><td>-50% 
Absolute reduction</td><td>Net-Zero</td></tr><tr><td>Scope 3</td><td>Base year</td><td>-30% 
Absolute reduction</td><td>Net-Zero</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>Base year</td><td>-33% 
Absolute reduction</td><td>Net-Zero</td></tr></table>

Capturing accurate Scope 3 data is challenging, and we use a 'spend-based' calculation for various categories of Scope 3, where 'activity-based' data are currently unavailable. Our largest source of emissions, and most difficult to obtain accurate activity data is Scope 3 Category 1, 'procured goods and services'. As our business grows there is an obvious connection in rising procurement activity to support increased operations. As a result, we expect GHG emissions associated with procurement to increase in the short term, while we work with our supply chain to obtain activity-based emissions data and encourage and support reductions in the emissions associated with what we buy. We are investing in new tools, and developing new processes and policy to improve data management (for example business travel).

# Re-baselineing of emissions targets

In FY23 QinetiQ made several acquisitions and divestments. Under the guidelines set out by the SBTi, (as outlined within the Restatement Policy of our methodology document), corporate

growth beyond a threshold value of  $5\%$  should trigger a 're-baseline' of stated GHG emissions targets, to be formally reported once any new acquisitions have been part of the Group for at least 12 months. We are therefore presenting the revised figures here for the first time. The re-baseline process requires the business to re-evaluate the carbon footprint of the organisation as it is today, while 'back-dating' the emissions associated with the new organisational structure to the date on which the original baseline was set.

For QinetiQ, we track our GHG emissions levels against the figures for FY20 (April 2019 - March 2020), therefore as part of the re-baseline we have removed all of the historic emissions figures back to FY20 from the businesses we have divested, while adding historic emissions figures from the new businesses we have acquired. We have maintained our original emissions targets, in terms of the percentage reductions against our Scope 1, 2 and 3 totals, as outlined above.

# Net-Zero Plan

# Our ambition

QinetiQ will be a Net-Zero company by 2050 or sooner with achievable and ambitious near-term GHG emissions reduction targets. To deliver this, we will take a global whole value chain approach. We will work proactively with our supplier ecosystem, continue to invest in relevant climate positive research and development to help our customers achieve their Net-Zero ambitions, while improving the operational efficiency and biodiversity of our estates and those we manage on behalf of our customers.

# Environmental continued

The original and updated FY20 baseline emissions for Scope 1 and 2 are as follows:

FY20 Baseline GHG emissions (tCO $_2$ e)  

<table><tr><td></td><td>Re-baseline</td><td>Original</td></tr><tr><td>Scope 1</td><td>28,377</td><td>19,289</td></tr><tr><td>Scope 2</td><td>16,281</td><td>16,298</td></tr></table>

The increase in our recalculated Scope 1 emissions is due primarily to the nature of Air Affairs business which is aircraft based and so significant users of jet fuel. Re-baselineing of our Scope 3 data will be finalised during the first half of FY25 and we will publish all updated figures on our website alongside our published methodology.

# Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions

We have adopted a financial control approach and used the GHG Protocol Corporate standard and UK Government emission conversion factors. We collect relevant data throughout the year via a dedicated team of energy experts. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) carried out a limited assurance engagement on selected GHG emissions data for the year ended 31 March 2024 in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (revised) and 3410, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. The figures covered by this assurance process are indicated in the table below by the following symbol  $\text{©}$ . A copy of PwC's report is available on our website: www.qinetiq.com/en/ourcompany/sustainability/climate-change

# Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR)

To comply with the UK Government's Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR) requirements, we present our energy performance in the table below (indicating the proportion for the UK). Our re-baseline exercise has resulted in adjustments to previous years' data and so we have included both re-baseline and previously reported figures in the table below for completeness. The following are examples of energy reduction projects undertaken in FY24:

- Implementation of a new energy monitoring software platform across our UK estate, to provide dynamic consumption figures, helping to highlight anomalies and forecast future demand.  
- Installation of low-energy LED lighting solutions at various UK sites.  
- Integration of a new multi-engine aircraft within our UK fleet, to increase capability while reducing the utilisation of larger less fuel-efficient platforms.  
- Reductions to our UK vehicle fleet, and sourcing hybrid or pure electric alternatives to replace existing assets where possible.  
- A trial of bio-fuel as a low emission alternative to diesel.  
- UK "Energy Shutdown" campaigns across extended holiday periods in the UK.

For more information see page 40, Initiative 1.

# Scope 3 emissions

We have set Scope 3 reduction targets and on page 40 (under Initiative 2) report the programmes that are supporting our goal to reduce these emissions.

We have previously published our FY20 baseline total Scope 3 emissions of  $229\mathrm{ktCO}_2\mathrm{e}$ , and we publish selected categories of our UK Scope 3 footprint within our annual Carbon Reduction Plan (please see our website for our 2023 report). While we are still processing our full Scope 3 footprint for FY24, we have already identified a significant increase in our emissions associated with business travel, which reflects the increasingly global nature of our business. As part of our annual processing of Scope 3 emissions and our emissions re-baselineing activity, we will be restating all of our historic Scope 3 emissions figures from our FY20 baseline year to date, and we will be publishing this information on our website in FY25 enabling us to demonstrate our progress against our target.

# GHG emissions reporting

In addition to the information presented here and on our website, we disclose our GHG emissions figures in a variety of formats to a number of external organisations annually including disclosures on our Air Affairs business to meet Australian Government National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Scheme (NGERS); the publication of a Carbon Reduction plan for our UK business to meet UK Government Policy Procurement Note PPN 06/12; Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) and Sustainability Climate Questionnaire.

Please note, following the re-baseline of our GHG emissions described on page 37, the figures (in black) in this table are different from those published in previous Annual Report and Accounts. We have included all previously reported figured in green and labelled 'PR' (Previously Reported), for completeness and to meet the requirements of SECR.

# Investment in Net-Zero

To deliver our Net-Zero plan, aligned with the four initiatives highlighted on page 37, we are delivering a number of projects; a comprehensive list can be found on pages 40 and 41, summarising what has been delivered in FY24, and planned activities for FY25 and beyond. These programmes are built into our annual Integrated Strategic Business Plan (ISBP). During FY25 we will be developing our Transition Plan (in line with the Transition Plan TaskForce) and aim to publish details in 2025.

# Stakeholder engagement

We have seen interest and focus on climate change from all stakeholders with a growing interest in climate resilience as well as emissions reduction. We have been actively participating, sharing knowledge and best practice in a number of cases leading and driving engagement across our industry and business community, for example our Group CEO is Industry Co-Chair of the Defence Suppliers Forum (DSF) and our Group Director ESG Chairs the UK Trade body ADS (Aerospace, Defence and Security) Sustainability Group. We have also engaged with our supply chain, via our industry working groups.

In January 2024, ADS launched a Defence ESG Charter which serves as a guiding framework, outlining commitments to environmental sustainability, social impact, and robust governance. QinetiQ contributed to the development of the charter, and were a primary signatory.

Our round table at the Defence and Security Equipment International (DSEI) Exhibition in September 2023 brought together a group of senior stakeholders from NATO, Australia and UK defence organisations, industry and academia and will be followed with a thought leadership report 'Sustainability on the Edge'. Cross-sector innovation will be central to defence and security effectiveness and climate adaptation. To support this, we engaged with innovators culminating in a Sustainable 'Tech Demo' Day to showcase an exciting breadth of emerging solutions to defence stakeholders.

We have continued and strengthened our cross-defence and industry collaboration. We are working with our academic partners to explore future capability development. We have continued to run the CHACR (Centre for Historical Analysis and Conflict Research)

programme which includes collaboration on Climate Change and (In)stability with Oxford University.

We engage with shareholders directly to discuss ESG and also provide ESG information to MSCI, Sustainability and CDP.

For our people we communicate regularly about sustainability through a range of channels and on a variety of topics. We have a dedicated online Community of Interest for sustainability (The Sustainability Knowledge NetworQ). During the year we have run a number of talks as part of our "Let's Talk Sustainability" series, with inspirational internal and external speakers. Many of our people show significant interest in climate change and regularly pose questions to leaders as part of our Global Employee Roadshow. Net-Zero forms part of our leadership incentive scheme see page 118 and we have provided a range of resources, blogs and drop-in sessions to support leaders.

# Case study

# Photovoltaic (PV) panel installation

At our Haslar site in the UK, we have installed three arrays of ground-mounted PV panels. The  $2,000\mathrm{m}^2$  installation is expected to generate over 200 MWh, avoiding approximately 45 tCO₂e annually

The arrays were installed towards the end of FY24 and in total, 35 MWh of renewable power was generated in the year.

This project and the installation of PV arrays at our QTEC facility in Melbourne form part of a wider programme to reduce our use of fossil fuels.

# Environmental continued

# Sustainable solutions and innovation

This year we allocated a modest but dedicated portion of our internal research and development (IRAD) funding to focus on sustainable science and technology. Supported by an Innovation Mentor, this builds on the launch of the IdeaXchange Net-Zero channel in 2023. Projects included the sustainable disposal of energetic materials, work on plant-based polymers, electro-optic monitoring of building heat loss, exploring cultural change toolkits and the benefits of electrification in defence operations (see case study below). We supported our customers in the UK to establish methods to acquire and support lower-emission, more climate-resilient capability, and collated the methods required to enable a coherent energy transition for defence. We continue to deliver a small proportion of our revenue from sustainability-related products and services (also see page 41).

# Environmental management

Reflecting our intent to integrate environmental governance and leadership more strongly into our core strategies, QinetiQ's environmental policy commitments were incorporated into a new Environmental, Social and Governance Policy in FY24, sponsored by the Group CFO. We continue to demonstrate environmental management systems conformance to the Standard ISO14001:2015 for our activities at 24 locations in the UK and one location in Canada.

Our Environment Council is now operational, and the primary focus of this multi-national governance forum in FY24 has been to develop an overarching approach to the environment across the Group, and development of a new set of environmental requirements that go beyond legal compliance and set a framework for continual improvement in the way we progress environmental stewardship across QinetiQ. These requirements are due to be published in early FY25. A Group-level environmental management assurance initiative commenced in FY24, focusing on Business Management Systems documentation related to internal environmental standards in the UK and customer environmental management plans in Australia. Trends in environmental incident reporting is part of Board reporting, and in conjunction with a health and safety incident reporting campaign, an initiative to improve the awareness of environmental incident reporting is under development and will be promoted in FY25.

During FY24 we developed new environmental content for our integrated environment, health and safety training which all employees will be required to complete in FY25. This training will continue to evolve and new content, focusing on climate change, will be developed during FY25.

# Waste management

For several years we have been reporting annual proportion  $(\%)$  of UK waste that is re-used and recycled from underlying waste production. Non-hazardous solid waste and hazardous waste generated represents a relatively low level of materiality on environmental and financial impact as part of our operations. We are currently reviewing our environmental data and metrics and will be defining new metrics and targets in the year ahead to reflect our priorities and new reporting requirements.

# Conservation and biodiversity

Eelmoor Marsh is a SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest), and forms part of our site in Farnborough, in the UK. We have worked with our conservation experts Marwell Wildlife to provide stewardship on this important site. We have raised awareness of the importance of biodiversity and conservation through our sustainability talk series as well as running conservation days as part of our environmental volunteering programme. We continue to perform conservation and biodiversity protection works at the sites we run on behalf of the MOD locations; supporting operation delivery while protecting flora and fauna.

In FY25 we will continue to focus on environmental stewardship programmes, building greater connection with our Net-Zero plan. We will be reviewing our policy and further improving training, awareness and environmental volunteering to engage our people.

# Case study

# Deployable Adaptive Smart Grid

The energy transition is intricately linked with climate change and requires our customers to adapt to maintain their ability to operate. In parallel, the electrification of the battlespace is significantly increasing the demand for electrical capacity and reliability. QinetiQ is co-creating a Deployable Adaptive Smart Grid (DASG) with our Australian Defence customers (image shows an artist's impression) When mature the DASG will address the shortfalls in current deployable electrical systems by managing generators, loads, energy storage and external connections to reduce fuel consumption, maximise grid resilience and maintain power quality. It will be accessible to non-expert users and will enable the integration of varied energy sources such as gas turbines, fuel cells, energy storage and renewables.

# Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures

The Financial Stability Board's Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommends a reporting framework across four themes: governance, strategy, risk management and metrics and targets. In line with Companies Act disclosure requirements (CA06 s414CB(2a) and following the TCFD all-sector guidance (there is no specific supplementary guidance for our sector) we provide our disclosures here (pages 41-45) aligned to the four themes and providing material information against each requirement (we also outline our approach on page 68 in our non-financial information and sustainability statement). We provide links to where further information is provided in this Annual Report and Accounts and on our website. We are committed to implementing this approach to provide investors and other stakeholders with information on climate-related risks that are relevant and material to our business.

# Compliance statement

We believe our approach is consistent with 10 of 11 of the TCFD recommendations and recognise we need to do more on quantitative modelling as part of the Strategy disclosures. During FY24 we have worked with third-party experts to develop new financial models to progress our quantitative financial assessment and will be testing these during FY25. We are also currently re-baselineing our GHG emissions and so will be publishing our Scope 3 data for FY24 during FY25, and not in this report.

# Board governance

The QinetiQ Board has overall responsibility for our ESG approach and climate change forms a core part of this agenda. It has oversight of the threats and opportunities resulting from climate change, and this is considered as part of our strategy. Our Group CFO is the Board Sponsor for the wider ESG programme, including climate change. Both the Group CFO, and our Group Director of ESG provide regular reports and briefings on ESG and climate change to the Board and Board Committees (see page 81 for our Board Governance Structure and pages 78-80 for membership of these committees).

The QinetiQ Board sets the Company's strategic priorities, including ESG and Net-Zero and has regular oversight and input into our Net-Zero programme. As part of the regular monitoring and reporting cycle, the Board were updated and discussed climate change at the May and November FY24 meetings, ensuring their oversight of progress against our targets.

Page 39: Leadership engagement

In addition the Board reviews our Integrated Strategic Business Plan (ISBP), where climate change is integrated into functional/sector plans and approves the annual budget (which contains Net-Zero targets and programmes). The Board also received updates on principal risks twice each year, which includes the climate change principal risk.

The Audit Committee reviews and monitors QinetiQ's financial and non-financial reporting requirements including TCFD. Updates on non-financial reporting were provided at both the November and March FY24 meetings (see page 100).

The Remuneration Committee has overseen and supported the inclusion of ESG within leadership incentives, including Net-Zero for the 2nd year, approved at the May meeting.

The Risk and Security Committee has oversight of and provides assurance to the Board on QinetiQ's risk management system. This includes quarterly monitoring and review of all QinetiQ principal risks, which includes the climate change principal risk (page 60).

# Management governance and oversight

The ESG Steering Committee, Chaired by the Group CEO, provided oversight, leadership and scrutiny of our Group ESG commitments and initiatives including performance against our Net-Zero Plan (see page 54). The Committee meets monthly and includes the Group CFO, Group Director ESG and members of the QLT. Leadership and delivery of the Climate Change Programme are the responsibility of the Group Director of ESG, reporting to the Group CFO. The Climate Change Programme includes leaders and subject matter experts from across the business, ensuring the necessary multidisciplinary approach. The programme is supported by a dedicated programme manager. The regular programme reviews and meetings create a

senior forum for developing and implementing strategy and plans and for reviewing risks and performance. Climate change is a principal risk (see page 60) and the Group Director ESG is responsible for identification, assessment and oversight of the risk and opportunities, undertaking monthly reviews of the programme and capturing those risks through the enterprise risk management governance process. The Group CFO has oversight of the programme and in addition to regular updates, undertakes a formal six-monthly review of progress and plans. Functional Councils support good governance across QinetiQ, where functional and sector leaders come together to communicate, review and agree on issues, actions and standards of best practice that are enterprise-wide and/or have operational significance. Relevant to our Climate Change Programme is the Environment Council, Chaired by the Group Director ESG, and the Risk and Assurance Council, Chaired by the Group Chief Risk Officer, attended by the Group Director ESG. Climate change has also been on the agenda at the Finance Council.

ESG and climate change form an integral part of our ISBP process, and so consideration of the role of individual sectors and functions was undertaken in H2 during the planning process, with oversight by the Group Director ESG and then reviewed by the CEO, CFO and Chief Strategy Officer.

In FY24, leaders were again incentivised specifically linked to our Net-Zero plan (See page 118). The scheme was expanded to include a larger cohort than FY23. This ongoing focus and involvement by leaders strengthens our commitment to our Net-Zero plan and underpins our leadership engagement (see page 39), oversight and governance.

# Climate-related risks and opportunities

Working with third-party experts, in FY24 we have reviewed and refined our climate-related risks and opportunities (see table on page 45). We have assessed that our business is exposed to both physical and transitional risks (before mitigation activities) and opportunities, with impacts varying over the short (0-2 years), medium (2-5 years) and long-term (5-20 years), depending on climate change scenarios. This aligns with our business planning cycle (our ISBP operates a rolling five-year cycle). Each risk was associated (qualitatively) with a financial impact, for example an increase in costs or in the case of opportunities, an increase in revenue.

We will continue to review our risks and opportunities as the external landscape and our business evolves over time, and we will also refine our approach, particularly focusing on quantifying the impacts, and we will report further information as this develops.

# Impact on business strategy and planning

As the climate change risks (threats and opportunities) we have identified what will impact our business, we recognise the importance of integrating climate change and wider ESG into our strategy and planning and our wider business processes. While there is no requirement for a fundamental shift in our overarching business strategy due to climate change, having assessed the risks we understand it to be resilient to climate change (subject to the delivery of the plans and programmes).

We have committed funding to support our Net-Zero programme for a range of initiatives across our functions and sectors (see pages 40 and 41).

This is illustrated as follows

- Our commitment to sustainability is part of QinetiQ's overarching strategic framework (page 8).  
Climate change is a principal risk (outlined on page 60).  
- Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions form one of our core non-financial KPIs (page 33)  
- Net-Zero is integrated into our leadership incentives (page 118).  
- In FY22 we developed and published our Net-Zero plan; including targets for emissions reduction (page 37). An overview of progress and plans is provided on pages 40-41 along with links to the full plan.

ESG and climate change are embedded in our annual ISBP process. During FY23 we planned for a number of actions which were implemented in FY24, including:

- Allocation of budget to deliver energy saving projects which reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.  
- Increase in resource: increasing our energy team capability and capacity and a new dedicated role to lead on sustainable solutions for customers.  
Investment in development of tools to mature the modelling and financial quantification of climate impacts.  
- A new internal research and development (IRAD) fund to support Net-Zero projects (see page 42).  
- Investment in access to third-party horizon scanning tools.

During our ISBP planning process in FY24 we undertook the following:

- The requirement for all sectors and functions to consider their contribution to ESG and Net-Zero.  
- Refinement of our investment approach including greater emphasis on Net-Zero;  
- Allocation of investment in our Net-Zero plan - including new GHG management tools and energy saving projects.  
- Development of further resources and training on climate change for leaders and employees.

In addition as part of the broader scenario impact assessment of our ISBP, a climate change event (a significant flood at a critical site) was selected as one scenario for financial modelling. The findings inform the consideration of the recommended longer-term viability statement and going-concern statement disclosures (see page 62). Through the ISBP process we have also identified potential business growth opportunity with our customers.

# Focus for FY25

During FY24 we worked with third-party experts to develop new tools to help define how to quantify the financial impacts of climate change, and will continue to develop this as part of our climate resilience programme, focusing on the risks and the controls and mitigations. We will continue to develop detailed transition planning (see page 39) which will underpin how we achieve Net-Zero targets and commitments, and mitigate the climate related risks we have identified. We will be further focusing on quantifying the growth potential of customer solutions, currently a small part of our capability portfolio, but with recognised potential.

Key: Scenarios (see below) Impact:  $x = \text{low}$ , xx=medium and xxx = high impact; Timescale: S=short term; M=medium term and L= long term

# Climate scenarios

While it is unequivocal that the climate is changing, the precise trajectory is dependent on the influence of activities in the past, the global action taken now and in the coming years and the rate at which that action is taken.

To guide our strategy and planning, we consider different scenarios:

-  $< 2^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  strongly declining emissions: Intensification of decarbonisation action resulting in increasing and rapid transition, with more limited physical impacts.

2-4°C stabilising/slowly declining emissions: Physical risks continue and transition risks continue to increase.  
-  $>4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ : rising emissions: Failure to address climate change results in high physical risks with more limited transition issues.

We used the scenarios above, based on the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), which are used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). We considered horizons aligned with our Net-Zero targets and used a variety of data sources.

We have aligned our assessment with our risk management approach (see next section - page 46) so that we are able to evaluate as low, medium or high. We plan to review this approach regularly.

We have made a qualitative assessment of the financial impacts (see above) and are currently working on modelling the quantitative impacts and this will be a focus for FY25.

# Identifying risk

In line with TCFD recommendations, our risk assessment approach addresses both physical risks and transition risks.

Climate change is a significant global issue and considerations for businesses include physical risks (with factors such as flooding and extreme weather events) and transition risks, which are related to the transition to a lower-carbon economy, such as policy or regulation change and changing markets. It is important that we understand where these types of issues are material to our business.

For physical risks we considered these primarily by site, and also considered issues such as our supply chain and business delivery. A variety of potential risks have been identified and captured (for example where there may be increased flood risk or exposure to storm events). We recognise that this needs to be a continuous process as there may be change, either due to new emerging information or changes to our business (e.g. use of site, supplier, etc). As part of our day-to-day management of our site operations, we are have a good understanding of the physical risks posed and the suitable mitigations.

To identify transition risks (such as market or regulatory changes) we undertake horizon scanning to identify any relevant changes. We have invested in access to a new third-party tool to strengthen our horizon-scanning approach.

During FY23 we acquired new businesses: Avantus, with offices in the US and Air Affairs, with facilities and an aircraft fleet, based in Australia. Integration of these acquisitions

progresses and we are focusing on improving data capture processes. We have also explored how we can further include aspects of Net-Zero and climate resilience as part of our mergers and acquisitions (M&A) approach.

# Assessing risk

We recognise the need to review and update our risks regularly as our business evolves and the global landscape changes. So, building on the risk assessment work completed in FY22 and FY23 (which included briefings and workshops), we undertook a detailed risk review and multi-stakeholder workshop supported by third-party experts. Risks and opportunities were scored considering:

- the potential impact,  
- the likelihood of occurrence,  
- the velocity (proximity of occurrence).

Scenario analysis has been undertaken on our most material risks and opportunities, and this has formed the foundation for our new financial models to quantify financial impacts (taking into account impact on revenue, costs, and asset value).

# Management of risk

Our risk management and control framework enables us to effectively identify, assess, monitor and manage risks.

Ownership and management of individual risks are assigned to members of the QLT who are responsible for ensuring the operational effectiveness of internal control systems and for implementing risk mitigation plans. Climate change is recognised as a principle risk (see page 60) and the Group CFO is accountable. This risk is reviewed quarterly.

The Board Risk and Security Committee review and discuss principle risks quarterly and the Board undertakes a twice yearly assessment of the principal risks (see page 43).

The QLT is supported by our Chief Risk Officer and our risk managers, who are able to have more tactical and operational oversight. All risks are assigned owners.

# Integrating/embedding into risk management

We have based our approach to climate risks on our existing risk management methodology (see page 56), to ensure that we are embedding it into our existing processes.

We will continue to regularly review physical risks across our sites, recognising potential for different impacts across our different geographies (primarily UK, US and Australia as well as Germany and Canada), as part of our risk management process. Managing transition risks requires us to consider a range of factors which could impact our business in the future. We routinely undertake horizon scanning for aspects such as emerging regulation and evolving markets (e.g. via our close engagement with customers on Net-Zero). Any new changes (e.g. new legislation) will be addressed in line with our standard processes. Key to supporting the management of risks is raising awareness and engagement with internal stakeholders. Our Sustainability Knowledge NetworQ (an interactive online portal for key stakeholders and all employees) includes a dedicated climate resilience 'resource hub'. We also engage with key stakeholders such as our Environment Council. We ran climate change workshops for our procurement community across the Group to explore emissions reduction and climate resilience associated with our supply chain. We are also co-creating a sector programme on climate resilience, through our role in the Defence Suppliers Forum (page 39).

Through FY24 and FY25 we are reviewing our Group policy to ensure that we have established and are maintaining robust and adequate procedures, systems and controls, to ensure the Group is able to manage risk and comply with its obligations.

# Metrics and targets

A key part of addressing the risks of climate change is to transition QinetiQ to Net-Zero, and so key metrics and targets are associated with our GHG emissions. We report progress against all key material metrics within the relevant sections of our Annual Report and Accounts.

# Our metrics

In FY21 we introduced Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions as one of our non-financial KPIs (see page 33). We currently monitor a number of non-financial metrics for our wider ESG programme and environmental stewardship. This includes our waste, water use, and contribution to biodiversity. We report a number of material metrics in this Annual Report and Accounts (summary table below), which have a bearing on climate change; such as intensity ratio and energy (see page 38). Our sites form the basis of our assessment of the physical risks, and employees are a driver for our operational footprint (e.g. business travel).

We aim to limit neutralization to less than  $10\%$  of our emissions.

In FY23 we introduced Net-Zero into our leadership incentive scheme and for FY24 aligned with reductions in Scope 1, Scope 2 and aspects of Scope 3 emissions (page 118).

# Disclosure of Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions

We align with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol to calculate our emissions (page 35) and publish our methodology for Scope 1 and 2 on our website. www.qinetiq.com/en/ourcompany/sustainability/climate-change We have re-baselineed our data to account for new acquisitions and divestments (page 38).

<table><tr><td></td><td>Year</td><td>GHG Emissions (tCO2e)</td></tr><tr><td>Scope 1</td><td>FY24</td><td>19,362</td></tr><tr><td>Scope 2</td><td>FY24</td><td>10,542</td></tr></table>

Scope 1 and scope 2 emissions have been subject to independent limited assurance procedures (see page 38 for details). We are in the process of calculating our Scope 3 emissions and will be publishing data in FY25 (we are not publishing previous Scope 3 data here as it is currently being re-baselineed and so figures would not be correct and could be misleading). We disclose our GHG emissions as part of a number of regulatory, customer, and voluntary requirements, (see page 38).

Our Net-Zero plan identified how we will address the reduction of emissions through four initiatives, and we describe the progress against these plans on pages 40 and 41. As part of our risk management approach we are managing the risks associated with the delivery of this plan and these are described on page 56. We also describe on page 38 the challenge of Scope 3 data and the approach we are taking to address this.

During FY25 will engage with stakeholders to develop a Transition Plan (aligned with guidance from the Transition Plan Taskforce) to build on our published Net-Zero plan and our current programmes. We plan to publish information on the Transition Plan in 2025.

# Performance against targets

On page 33 we have reported a  $33\%$  reduction in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions against our re-baseline FY20 number towards our target of  $50\%$  reduction by 2030. We will be reporting progress against our Scope 3 emissions target during FY25 when we have published our FY24 data and completed the re-baseline exercise. However, we have identified there have been an increase in some categories of Scope 3, (e.g. Business Travel). We use our Net-Zero targets to drive our Net-Zero plan, managing the risks to delivery and maximising opportunities. Progress against the plan is detailed on pages 40-41. Progress against the non-financial component of the leadership incentives are reported in our remuneration report (page 118).

# Plans for FY25

We will be focusing on an ESG data improvement programme during FY25 and so will be looking holistically at the most material metrics and targets to inform our climate change and wider ESG programmes and aim to share further metrics and targets as part of future TCFD reporting.

# Social

To support our people we are focused on having a culture that enables sustainable growth and a high-performance environment where they can thrive and deliver.

Furthermore, it is also important to us that we have a positive social impact in the communities in which we operate.

# Our people

# Safety and wellbeing

# Safety

We continue to reinforce the positive impact we have on the health, safety and wellbeing of our people, creating a safe and secure environment for us all to care and thrive. Our QinetiQ Groupwide Safety Improvement Programme which was established in FY22 provides us with strong foundations for the future and we are proud of our achievements in FY24:

- Strengthened our global safety organisation further and built internal capability, enabling us to transition our safety improvement delivery in-house, while still maintaining a partnership with third-party experts dss+.  
- Conducted risk stabilisation activities across the majority of our global footprint, setting us up for sustained, detailed safety assurance activities and refining our future approach.  
- Brought in additional subject matter experts to support a risk-based approach at a strategic, tactical, and operational level in the areas of safety, occupational health and wellbeing.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/714f5f9f-1b4d-4c48-bebd-74c375e8405a/4eb8b58ed783d7e4511d43389e35100ff275c9cfe5bfa00e50df38d4d717fd63.jpg)

- Refined the safety maturity assessment we introduced in FY23 to enable the ongoing measurement of our safety culture maturity and to identify improvement opportunities throughout the year.  
- Linked our Common Goals to safety culture maturity to amplify the impact our leadership community has on our Safety Improvement Programme (see page 118).  
- Refreshed our safety technology suite, introducing a new safety compliance tool to work in a more standardised way across the Group as well as making ongoing enhancements to our safety incident reporting system.  
- Continued to update and refresh our safety management system and refine our processes, working closely with the teams in all our markets.

Our safety performance over the past 12 months shows:

- A fall in our Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) rate from 2.75 in FY23 to 2.54 in FY24. (TRIR is calculated using the total number of recordable incidents, multiplied by 1000, divided by the average number of employees in that year).  
- A decrease in our LTI rate from 1.74 in FY23 to 1.58 in FY24. LTI rate is one of our non-financial KPIs (see page 33).

# Lost Time Incident (LTI) Rate

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/714f5f9f-1b4d-4c48-bebd-74c375e8405a/252085cb50c995d9319f02063eda1e085ba5b9c301f1e382e14ae7fbef6efb90.jpg)

There were no prosecutions or prohibition notices issued by regulators during FY24.

We were deeply saddened by the fatal crash involving two aircrew on-board one of our PC-9 aircraft in the Neuenstein area of Germany whilst on a customer training exercise in September 2023. Our thoughts remain with the families and close colleagues. Although the formal investigations into this accident are ongoing, we do not believe that there was any contributory fault by the Company.

As we prepare to transition our Safety Improvement Programme activities into business as usual, and refine our ways of working, we continue to invest in our commitment to safety. Ongoing engagement of our people in our safety improvement journey is key and we will undertake a follow-on global safety perception survey in FY26.

# Wellbeing

Our wellbeing strategy provides direction and a common approach for our wellbeing programme, which ensures we have the tools, techniques and support networks to take care of our people. Our strategy includes not only physical and mental health, but also personal growth, working environment and financial wellbeing. Senior Level-led governance is in place with oversight of both wellbeing and safety through our Wellbeing Steering Group.

Through our Group enterprise agreement with LinkedIn Learning, we've provided access to resources to support the leadership of wellbeing for managers to help build their skills to support their own wellbeing and the wellbeing of their team. We've also reviewed the toolkits we provide to cope with workload and stress and anxiety.

To support financial wellbeing we've continued our employee hardship fund which has enabled 74 employees to access additional funds to help them through times of financial difficulty. Our progressive pay and reward review this year has also supported our Financial wellbeing initiatives, uplifting salaries to address market-rate gaps.

One of our many wellbeing interventions is Yu-life, an incentive-based App, providing daily challenges to improve physical and mental wellbeing. There is also a social impact benefit as completing the challenges can convert into opportunities to contribute to environmental or social good causes. We have seen 4,574 trees planted and 4,204 meals gifted.

We are progressive with adaptive working patterns, with colleagues shaping how and where they work so as to deliver the best business outcomes and support employee wellbeing.

How we support our people through our wellbeing agenda and strategy is evolving for FY25. Our focus will be to review our overall approach to health and wellness, across the entire employee life cycle.

# Diversity, equity and inclusion

Creating an environment where everyone feels they belong and can thrive is a vital part of our culture. In FY23 we launched our Inclusion, Diversity and Belonging Strategy (published on our website www.qinetiq.com/en/ourcompany/sustainability/diversity-and-inclusion) It shares our progress so far, as well as our focus and direction, demonstrating how we are committed to:

- Fostering inclusive behaviours and creating an environment where our people can thrive;  
- Actively increasing the diversity of our Company to reflect the communities in which we operate;  
- Providing equity of opportunity to all our people and prospective employees;  
- Engaging with our customers, supply chain and external partners demonstrating and promoting best practice;  
- Keeping our people, customers and shareholders informed of our progress

In FY24 we appointed a new Global Inclusion, Diversity & Cultural Development Lead to work with colleagues across our Company to deliver our strategy.

The following outlines our focus and achievements in FY24.

Since October 2022, we have been proud to be part of KPMG's Cross Company Allyship programme, which is a mentorship initiative bringing together mentors with mentees with a focus on supporting those from black heritage and ethnic minority backgrounds to address under-representation in leadership positions. In our first cohort we had 20 mentees and 13 mentors and the current cohort, 16 mentees and 16 mentors.

In the US, our Head of Diversity Initiatives has launched a Leadership Inclusion Council to identify and champion "The Path to Belonging" which focuses on:

- Take care of yourself (Health and wellness)  
Take care of each other (ERGs)  
- Take care of our community (Service Squad)

These focus areas are underpinned by the US Employee Resource Groups (ERG).

In FY23 we introduced a new diversity and inclusion category into our Gala Awards. The winners in the category represent the teams and people who go above and beyond their day-to-day roles to create a workplace where everyone feels they belong. In FY24 the winners of the category were the Neurodiversity Employee Network Group; a team of volunteers who care passionately about creating an inclusive place to work. The team were aware there was a need to raise awareness and understanding of this topic and they collaborated to create a session they could deliver virtually. They worked hard to research content, building on their own experiences to ensure it was presented in a way that was thoughtful, sensitive and impactful. Over 1,000 people voluntarily attended the sessions, demonstrating that this is a topic people would like to know more about.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/714f5f9f-1b4d-4c48-bebd-74c375e8405a/91f67cb239c61f8072e2e60ce1e744f6603bc93389a1059c0c1b5b5ba54e5f8e.jpg)

With the introduction of a new people system (Success Factors) in FY21, we ensured we were able to capture diversity information about our people; to address gaps in representation, to shape and inform future decisions and facilitate targeted, measurable action. This information is driven by self-identification and we recognise that requesting personal data requires us to regularly share why it is so important.

In FY24 we launched the 'Count Me In' campaign in the UK to encourage greater awareness and participation in the UK and form a proactive step to building a more diverse and inclusive QinetiQ. Thorough and accurate reporting will help drive KPIs and subsequent progression. While we regularly publish data on gender, we look forward to be able to present more diversity information in future Annual Reports and Accounts.

QinetiQ is committed to fostering diverse leadership and increasing female representation. Not just because its the right thing to do, but because we recognise the value that it brings to the culture of our business, and our ability to innovate.

Our target is to achieve  $30\%$  female representation at all levels across the Company, by 2030, and we are also focused on increasing ethnic diversity in leadership roles by 2027. These initiatives are integrated and mutually reinforcing, as progress in one area positively impacts the other.

Through inclusive leadership development, targeted recruitment strategies, mentorship programmes and a supportive work environment, we are cultivating a diverse talent pipeline and fostering an inclusive workplace culture.

All employees (including leaders)

The table and charts above show our gender balance data and we are pleased to see a further small improvement.

In our latest UK Gender Pay Gap report (for the FY23 reporting period) we report a mean pay gap of  $11.8\%$  which is a reduction compared with the previous year (12.9% for the FY22 reporting period).

We also participate annually in the FTSE Women Leaders Review. During FY24 we reported  $28.2\%$  female representation in our Executive Committee (the QLT) plus direct reports, compared with  $27.8\%$  in FY23.

No one action drives gender diversity and we recognise there is more to do to meet our target; we are focusing on further developing our plan in FY25.

# Employee voice

Critical to all of our people is feeling informed and ensuring that the employee voice is heard. Our global operating model and 'Adaptive Working', requires an engagement approach that supports both a geographically and temporally dispersed workforce.

Two-way communication channels, including our Global Portal Intranet, monthly live events through Q-Talk, and virtual communities, encourage our people to share their thoughts, feedback and experience.

We have a global Site Champion network, which focuses on creating a sense of community.

We hold Global Employee Roadshows twice a year, providing an opportunity for our people to hear from the QinetiQ Leadership Team about our growth strategy and important topics from across the global business, and to enable them to

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/714f5f9f-1b4d-4c48-bebd-74c375e8405a/196bbff3837c375d3bd5e676c1a87da15f3204d0c0bcc8ca61d08c0319faa62d.jpg)

ask questions of leaders. Employee views are represented by the Global Employee Voice (GEV), a group of employees who work alongside leaders to help shape ideas and initiatives that make QinetiQ a great place to work. The GEV representatives meet regularly with the Group CEO and Chief People Officer and have also met with the Chair and Board members during the year (see page 89).

In FY24 the GEV gave feedback that contributed to changes including significant investment in our employee reward offering (reward uplifts), changes in working schedules (compressed working), and the introduction of new learning solutions.

Our voluntary attrition has shown a small reduction from  $14.1\%$  in FY24, compared with  $14.3\%$  in FY23. We continue to observe some hotspots in the US and Australia, in line with the skills landscape.

Employee engagement is one of our three non-financial KPIs (see page 33), reflecting its importance to our business strategy. We have now been using the Workday Peakon as our Group Employee Engagement Survey platform for five years; it enables us to measure and track progress and benchmark against other organisations. Peakon also provides regular insights that enable us to make informed decisions and direct focus where it is most needed. This helps us understand what is important to our people, so that we can take action at a global, business and team level.

In FY24 we achieved our highest employee engagement score to date, reaching 7.5 (out of 10), an increase of 0.1 from FY23. Engagement has increased by  $19\%$  over the five years, and participation is now  $71\%$ . This is against a difficult backdrop with cost of living challenges for employees across our international footprint, which saw a dip in the Reward element of the survey in the middle of the year. Through our continuous listening approach we were able to quickly identify these concerns, understand how best to address them, whilst balancing our financial performance, and make meaningful pay interventions, which was reflected in an improvement in the reward indicators in Peakon.

Our employee engagement survey helps us understand areas we need to focus on to improve engagement. Effort in FY25 will continue across all elements of engagement with particular focus on employees having the right equipment to perform their roles (as currently we see this is below benchmark). Our Digital Transformation programme and site investment strategy will make a material difference in this area.

# Adaptability and flexibility

We continue to place adaptability and flexibility as a key part of our employee offering. Our ability to attract and retain talent at QinetiQ is enhanced by having an adaptable approach to where, how and when our people deliver in their roles. In FY24 we saw more than 1,000 employees take advantage of compressed working patterns, driving benefits for customers, internal service levels and for the employees themselves.

# In FY25 we will focus on our Digital

Transformation of internal tools, so that global collaboration, cross-team and project working and the productivity of employees working a hybrid home/office pattern all benefit.

# Learning and development: skills and talent

We are committed to nurturing talent and fostering a culture of progression within QinetiQ where our people can thrive and develop the right skills to grow and deliver. Similarly, as a company we see upskilling and reskilling as core to our AUKUS ambition, working across Australia, UK and US to build the capabilities for the future in support of our mission.

An example of this is the successful Test and Evaluation, Sovereign Skills Program (TESS-P) which upskills engineers in Australia with UK domain expertise because those skills are scarce but required. We are proud of this programme because it spans our international boundaries and is delivered both digitally and face to face through real exposure to live projects. Learners and instructors alike get a huge amount from each other as do wider parts of our organisation who benefit from the outturn of digital courses.

Another area of success across the year has been the creation and early delivery of Project Management Improvement. This focuses on project delivery and seeks to unify our approach to projects with tools for understanding competence, improvement and learning aspects so that we can all execute, consistently and to a high quality, across our global portfolio. This will continue into FY25.

Through employee feedback, we know that having opportunities to develop and grow careers is vitally important. We have partnered globally with LinkedIn Learning delivering digital content to all parts of the Company with over 80,000 courses and videos accessed in the past nine months alone (June to February 24). This enables our people to access learning flexibly, at pace, in the flow of work.

Combining this technology with in-house content also allows us to build skills at scale by developing bespoke learning paths and helping us plan for the future.

Building on our success this year a key priority for us in FY25 will be to further enhance learning capability globally. We will do this through adopting new tools and process and partnering across all business leaders to enable in-year performance with various personal and collective development and mentoring interventions.

# Leadership

We operate in a highly competitive and challenging market with an ambition to continue significant, sustainable growth. We recognise that to realise this, it is critical for us to develop the right leadership skills and capabilities, investing in our leaders to continually improve. Leaders are encouraged to take a coaching approach to their work with others and may have self-elected to become reverse mentees, themselves learning from Early Careers colleagues. The feedback on this programme continues to be very positive.

To further support leaders we completed a Group-wide Organisation Network Analysis providing a quantitative baseline from which to measure future progress. This has given valuable insight to design leadership expectations for performance, culture and global collaboration.

This was launched recently and already well received within the leadership community. The data is also being used to inform Group-wide leadership development initiatives for FY25 with the help of a recently established global QLC design community.

Spanning sector and functional stakeholders in design sprints, this shapes our leadership development approach and through cascading behaviours and positive attributes, helps set a tone for others to follow.

# Commitment to The  $5 \%$  Club

As a patron and a founding member of The  $5 \%$ Club, we remain committed to achieving  $5 \%$ of our workforce being within our Early Careers population. We commit to publishing a breakdown of our UK Early Careers community each year (see table above) including the percentage they comprise of the UK workforce and we are pleased with the progress we have made towards our goal.

# Early Careers

Investing in the next generation ensures we are developing the skills and capabilities needed for the future, as well as creating a near-term talent pipeline.

Our Early Careers approach provides a rich and rewarding learning experience for individuals as they start their career with us. In the UK we focus on graduates and apprentices, as well as Year in Industry students and summer placements.

We continue to focus on ensuring our Early Careers community is involved in meaningful work, with opportunity to develop their business knowledge, personal skills and understand how their work contributes to meeting our customers' requirements.

We have seen an increase in the number of apprentices being recruited with very encouraging feedback from all stakeholders, including customers, managers and the apprentices themselves. In addition, more graduates are being recruited and we have a stable level of Year in Industry students working with us during their degree programmes.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/714f5f9f-1b4d-4c48-bebd-74c375e8405a/69d423016c536472e77349fab508ef4fd560b65792d3e3f0b6e9852b6d86d763.jpg)

//We are proud to be founding members of The  $5 \%$ Club. //

Chris Shirley, Head of UK Skills and Development

It should be noted that these numbers do not include re-skilling; we have 39 experienced employees using apprenticeships to reskill across a range of disciplines.

# Reward and recognition

Reward and recognition is key to our people strategy and an important part of our global employee offering. Our approach is designed to enhance the wellbeing of our people and incentivise both collective performance and individual contribution; enabling us to make choices about what works best for ourselves and for our families. Focus in FY24 includes:

- Through our Rewarding for Performance framework, our people have been able to collectively share in our success:  
- Our All Employee Incentive Scheme (AEIS) for contribution in FY24 paid £1,138 to each employee.  
- We continue to invest in Pay and Progression, addressing market anomalies and managing in-year role and grade progression, with an investment of over £1.5m.  
- Through Thank Q, our global recognition scheme, we celebrated 5,451 individual people and 1,688 teams, with 12,705 awards.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/714f5f9f-1b4d-4c48-bebd-74c375e8405a/b1bbb7f80a066c1952df7c76147423841a33f568e711f6cc20402b49b1270e8b.jpg)

Building on the cost of living measures we implemented in FY23, we have invested further in our overall employee offering in FY24. In the UK, we have implemented a reward strategy and addressed market relativity through providing additional base salary increases to employees ensuring they receive a fair market level of pay. In the US we have implemented a compensation framework in support of integration. In the Australia sector we have commenced a benchmarking exercise and will be developing a sector-level reward strategy over FY25.

In March 2024 we were delighted to achieve accreditation by the Real Living Wage Foundation in the UK and are now one of over 14,000 Living Wage employers.

Our Group Hardship Fund and Employee Assistance Programmes (EAP) continue to provide additional support to our people who are experiencing challenging personal circumstances.

Looking forward to FY25, the Company will continue to invest in our global reward and benefits strategy and our employee offering.

# Responsibility and sustainability: Volunteering

At QinetiQ, volunteering is a vital part of our community impact strategy enabling our skilled workforce to dedicate their time and expertise to deliver social, environmental and economic benefits within the communities where we work. We focus on skills based volunteering, on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) outreach, to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers and also environmental volunteering to contribute towards conservation and biodiversity.

In FY24 we supported a variety of projects, including scrub clearing on a SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest), our annual outreach event for International Women in Engineering Day, our Powerboat Challenge, where young people design build and race model boats, and a hands-on hydraulic experience at our QTEC facility in Melbourne. Through our global employee volunteering programme we've contributed over 2,600 hours of service.

We value the expertise of partnerships with organisations such as the Jon Egging Trust (JET), where we’ve continued to roll out our interactive apprentice workshop. We also started a new UK partnership with the Royal Air Forces Association (RAFA), which has enabled QinetiQ employees the opportunity to volunteer in RAFA’s community check-in calls campaign.

During FY24 we launched our new external STEM Discoveries section of our website. This highlights the activities delivered by our STEM volunteers throughout the year; additionally it hosts valuable resources, including our new CREST-accredited project on compostable plastic, which students and teachers can freely download.

In FY25 we will be focusing on increasing our impact, including growing our volunteering include a new focus in our US business called "Impact Day".

# Charities

Across QinetiQ we remain committed to creating a positive impact in the communities local to our sites. We proudly support a diverse range of charitable organisations and community causes, with a focus on areas such as health, veterans and local rescue services.

We supported 23 individual site charities nominated by our people. Our Corporate partner charities include two in the UK - JET and RAFA. In the US, we support the Joint Service Special Operations Fund (JSSOF). In Australia we've continued to partner with Legacy, and in Canada, we've supported Ottawa Food Bank and Root Cellar. Please see our website for more information: www.qinetiq.com/en/ourcompany/sustainability/community-investment

In FY25 we intend to continue to develop our partnerships with organisations that support us in creating a positive impact in our communities.

# Our defence partnerships

We have always been passionate about supporting our Armed Forces community. Including veterans and reservists within our Company greatly enhances how we connect with our customers. This relationship goes beyond our legal obligations whether in Australia, UK, or US. In 2016 we were awarded Gold Award status by the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD) in their Defence Employer Recognition Scheme. This recognises employers who demonstrate a commitment to Defence by proactively supporting the Armed Forces community and inspiring others to do the same. Through our advocacy approach we were revalidated in 2022 and were delighted to receive our Gold Award from Major General Swift in March 2023.

We signed the UK Armed Forces Covenant in 2013 and continue to create covenant-related initiatives, such as our global QinetiQ Veterans and Reserves Network, which helps to connect, support and value colleagues who serve or have served in their nations' Armed Forces. A new covenant with enhanced support of forces and reservists' spouses and families was published in 2023.

In the US, we have an Outreach programme for Veterans through Circa and Military Offices Association of America and we participate in military hiring events through Recruit Military and Corporate Grey. We contribute to the Virginia Veteran Values Program and have been active participants in 'Hiring our Heroes' events.

In Australia we are pledge partners with Soldier On and attend their network events which has resulted in attracting talent into the business as well as encouraging others to do likewise. We are also a signatory to the Prime Minister's Veteran Employment programme.

# Governance

Governance is a critical pillar, supporting us in how we deliver all we do, responsibly and sustainably.

# Governance and leadership of our responsible and sustainable business approach

Our approach to sustainability is sponsored by our Group CFO and actively supported by our Board. Our Group Director of ESG leads our strategy and programmes, working with leaders and subject matter experts across the business, and provides regular papers and briefings to the Board and Board Committees. These cover all material aspects of our sustainability programmes including sustainability strategy, climate change, stakeholder engagement and non-financial reporting, ethics and community impact (page 87). Programmes such as anti-bribery and corruption, confidential reporting, safety or diversity, equity and inclusion are updated to the Board via direct papers from the function leaders. This provides oversight of our approach, including progress against programmes and plans.

During FY24 governance and oversight was also conducted via our monthly ESG Steering Committee, chaired by our Group CEO. Our Functional Councils provide additional focus on environment, our people and safety and wellbeing, as well as risk and assurance and governance. Pages 68 and 69 detail our policy and assurance approach.

Our sustainability strategy forms an integral part of our ISBP and includes longer-term plans e.g. our Net-Zero plan with targets to 2030 and 2050. Each function and sector is also required to articulate their contribution to sustainability within the ISBP process and we continue to embed ESG factors into our strategy and our day-to-day business processes. ESG is linked to the non-financial element of our leadership incentive scheme.

In FY25 we will be focusing on the new regulatory reporting requirements, supported by how we improve reliability and predictability of data and assurance of our non-financial information.

# Business ethics, doing business the right way

Our values of integrity, collaboration and performance underpin all that we do (page 76).

Our Code of Conduct defines our ethical standards, providing clear direction and guidance on how we do business. It contains information on ethical decision-making and also how to seek help and advice. We review the Code annually to reflect the evolving needs of our business, the regulatory environment and best practice. The Code is for our people but we also make it available for customers, suppliers and other partners. Our Code of Conduct is available on our website. www.qinetiq.com/en/our-company/sustainability/business-ethics

Annual business ethics training is mandatory and supports our people in understanding and using the Code of Conduct. The training is undertaken by our Board and is available to our suppliers and customers. We provide a number of challenging scenarios to help our people know what to do if they were to come across issues such as bribery, fraud, harassment, conflict of interest and modern slavery.

# Speak up

We strive to create an environment where our people feel confident to speak up and we provide a number of different ways for them to seek help or to raise concerns. Employees can talk to a manager, use our ethics email advice services, our global network of Ethics Champions and our independently run, 24/7, confidential reporting line.

These are also available to third parties via our Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct (page 55), both published on our website. Throughout the year we have promoted the importance of speaking up and the various different contact routes, via awareness

campaigns, in the Code of Conduct and in our mandatory business ethics training. We promoted our Speak Up Guide for Managers, supporting them in creating an open and inclusive environment, where our people feel confident to raise concerns, and managers know how to listen to and support anyone who may come to them with an issue.

For third parties, we have promoted our Speak Up contacts via our website and in our supplier Code of Conduct. We have responded to all queries received via our ethics email advice services and confidential reporting line. Our Audit Committee oversees our approach to confidential reporting (see page 90).

Our Business Ethics Committee, chaired by our Chief Ethics Officer (Group Director Legal & Company Secretary), oversees our ethics programme. We are members of our trade association, ADS, Business Ethics Network where members can share best practice on ethics, human rights and anti-bribery.

Our focus in FY25 will be to continue to promote and raise awareness on Speak Up.

# Anti-bribery and corruption

Our zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption in any form is explicitly stated in our Code of Conduct and our global anti-bribery and corruption procedures require that all business activity is conducted without the intent to bribe or corrupt; is reasonable and transparent; is appropriately documented with a business rationale and is authorised at an appropriate level.

Our anti-bribery and corruption programme is designed to support our people and business partners to demonstrate the highest standards of ethical conduct within all the jurisdictions in which we operate.

We provide practical guidance, including regular training, to ensure that our people understand what is expected of them and where they can get support or raise concerns.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/714f5f9f-1b4d-4c48-bebd-74c375e8405a/938582e6b51e0c70213b92d3606c4a6a4d9ffb548cd7c4c937e5ac058f17b48f.jpg)

Risk-based due diligence procedures are in place to identify and assess exposure to bribery and corruption in our operations; these are subject to on-going monitoring and periodic review. We review our programme regularly to ensure that it remains effective and incorporates improvements identified through internal assurance activity and feedback from our people.

In FY25 we will be focusing on supporting our people through training with a review of targeted role specific training modules.

# Human rights and modern slavery

As part of our ongoing programme to address the risk of modern slavery, we operate and manage an action plan across the Group. We continue to provide in-depth training to those in key roles (we have moved from e-learning to live training), and develop new supporting resources for all employees and suppliers, including industry engagement events such as our Collaborate programme. We regularly review our policies and our approach to risk in the supply chain. Our updated supplier Code of Conduct helps to ensure our suppliers have clarity of their responsibilities on human rights, modern slavery and speaking up. Our annual modern slavery and human trafficking statement is published on our website homepage. We achieved  $82\%$  against the UK Government Modern Slavery Assessment Tool.

We seek to anticipate, prevent and mitigate potential negative human rights impacts through our policy and processes, which underpin our commitment to responsible business practices. For example, we address salient human rights issues through our Code of Conduct, our ethical trading policy, international business risk management process, grievance mechanisms, due diligence and export controls process. Our confidential reporting mechanism (page 54) provides routes for third parties to raise concerns. We monitor the application of these policies and procedures through our business and supplier assurance processes and regular self-assessment, with oversight by our Business Ethics Committee. We believe that this integrated approach is effective in ensuring

our business acts responsibly and respects all human rights. More information, including all our annual modern slavery statements, can be found on our website: www.qinetiq.com/en/ our-company/ sustainability/business-ethics.

In FY25 we will continue to make progress against our modern slavery action plan and we will be reviewing and updating our policies and processes to support our approach to ethical trading and human rights.

# Responsible tax management

We make a significant tax contribution to the economies of the countries where we operate. In alignment with our sustainability and tax strategies, we strive to be responsible in all our business dealings with zero tolerance of tax evasion. Our annual tax strategy statement is published on our website. We apply our approach to tax management in a consistent and transparent manner in our dealings with tax authorities around the world. As a UK-headquartered Group we file our country-by-country report with the UK tax authorities. Our policies, processes and controls are regularly reviewed and risk assessed. Recognising the importance of embedding the tax strategy as a Group-wide culture, we provide relevant tax insights through our quarterly internal newsletter and bespoke tax training. Our Audit Committee oversees our approach to tax.

# Working with our supply chain

Our supply chain is an extension of our Company. We ensure that our suppliers are committed to the same standards and values of safety, security, sustainability and governance as we are. Working in collaboration with wider industry, we foster and develop ecosystems which draw together suppliers, academia and third-sector communities to answer complex challenges in science, social, engineering and technology, to support our customer offering.

Through this approach we enable access to opportunities for diverse suppliers, including Small to Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) and non-traditional defence suppliers, removing barriers to entry and promoting

inclusive procurement. We continue to support the SME community through the Defence Suppliers Forum SME Working Group and being an active prime contractor at the Defence Procurement Research and Technology Exportability (DPRTE) trade show. This has included enhancing our Small-Medium Enterprise Hub webpages to make it easier for suppliers to engage with QinetiQ and register their interest with us, by routing their enquiries directly to the relevant supply chain category management team through our taxonomy linked registration form.

Our QinetiQ Collaborate series aims to ensure good practices are shared throughout our supply chain and wider external stakeholders. We provide a consistent platform for learning through panels of subject matter experts from across the defence and security industry. In FY24 we ran Collaborate events on modern slavery and SME's and Net-Zero. We also continue our work with the Aerospace and Defence Procurement Group (ADPG) and the Joint Supply Chain Accreditation Register (JOSCAR), an industry collaboration.

We have our Sustainable Procurement Guide and Supplier Code of Conduct; both documents are available on our website: www.qinetiq.com/en/our-company/suppliers-and-smes

As signatories to the UK Prompt Payment Code, we continue to report our payment performance as required by UK legislation. In FY24 we gained accreditation from the UK Real Living Wage Foundation, guaranteeing an above-statutory level of pay for third-party subcontractors working on our UK sites. We are currently working towards Real Living Wage accreditation with QinetiQ Canada.

In FY25 we will continue to develop our approach to sustainable procurement and run further Collaborate events. In support of our Net-Zero programme, we have developed new supplier terms and conditions related to GHG emissions, and will be engaging with suppliers in FY25.

# Risk management

Risk management in QinetiQ is an established process that is critical to the achievement of the Company's strategic goals. The Group has effective systems and controls in place to manage current and emerging risks within the established risk appetite levels.

In an ever-changing risk landscape, our end-to-end review and improvement cycle aims to ensure we are well positioned to deliver results, while understanding and addressing the risks that could impact the ability to execute our strategy.

# How we protect our business

On behalf of the Board, the Risk & Security Committee provides oversight of the Company's principal risks, reviewing and monitoring them through the course of the year. Each principal risk is assigned to a specific category (strategic, operational or financial), which helps establish appropriate risk control strategies and activities and provides an appropriate level of oversight and assurance.

Risk owners are accountable for confirming adequate controls are in place, and that the necessary mitigation plans are used to bring the risk within an acceptable tolerance level.

# Identifying and managing our risks

As part of our continual review and improvement of our risk maturity, we have embedded a cyclical process of identifying, evaluating, managing and reporting of current and emerging risks. This process ensures we keep pace with a growing business in a complex industry and that we manage our risks in line with our long-term priorities.

Our annual cycle consists of comprehensive identification and review of risks material to the Group which we conduct together with our Sectors and Functions, taking into account industry insights, competitor analyses, geopolitical developments and advancements in technology.

We align our assurance activity to the identified risks in the context of our business processes and how those risks may affect our strategic goals and day-to-day operations. This is presented to the Board and Risk and Security Committee, ensuring adequate monitoring to maintain the effectiveness of the Group's risk management activities and internal control processes.

Sectors conduct bi-annual detailed reviews of their risks which is reported to the Board and Risk and Security Committee. This process ensures bottom-up and top-down views of risk have been considered and that the actions and controls to mitigate these risks are in place and are appropriate.

# Risk management and assurance activity

# The Three Lines Model

Our risk management and assurance activity follows the Institute of Internal Auditors' Three Lines Model which is the industry standard. The first line reports to the QinetiQ Leadership Team, second line through the Chief Risk Officer to the QinetiQ Leadership Team and the Risk and Security Committee, and the independent third line that sits outside the risk management processes and reports to both the QinetiQ Leadership Team and to the Audit Committee. The first line is performed by operational management who are responsible for managing risks. The second line is performed by teams that provide expertise, framework design and oversight role but sit outside of day-to-day management of the risks. The third line is performed by internal or external teams such as Internal Audit that provide independent objective assurance.

# Principal risks

The Group Principal Risk Register consists of material risks that could affect the delivery of our strategic objectives and may have a material impact on our stakeholders and environment. We accept that risk is an inherent part of doing business and our Principal Risk Register aims to provide reasonable assurance that we understand, monitor and manage the effects of the main uncertainties that we face in delivering our objectives.

Each principal risk is assessed in relation to the impact to the Group and is overseen directly by the Board. The Board confirms that a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group has been carried out, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.

The summary of risks and associated handling actions taken by management including the controls and any additional mitigations are provided below.

# Key changes to our Principal Risks

In Q3 FY 2024, we conducted a series of workshops with function and sector leaders to review and discuss the company's risks. The results were shared with the QinetiQ Leadership Team, who agreed the principal risks and a number of key (watchlist) risks. The Risk & Security Committee subsequently reviewed and approved the risks.

The Digital & Data Programme and Large Contract Renewal principal risks were retired due to mitigation activities that lowered their risk scores to an acceptable level.  
- The Macroeconomic Uncertainty, People Security and Physical Security principal risks were moved to key risks (see section below).  
- The Health and Safety principal risk was refined to include Wellbeing as a component.  
- Recognising the dynamic landscape, Competitive Landscape and Disruptive Technologies were added as principal risks.  
- With a number of key transformation projects underway, Management of Change was added as a principal risk.

IT Infrastructure was added as a principal risk recognising the importance of the implementation of GII/DW and supportability of some of our business services.  
License to Operate was added as a principal risk acting as umbrella for legal, compliance and regulatory related risks.

Achieved risk reduction in three major risk areas enabling us to decrease our overall risk exposure  
- Successfully completed and achieved recertification in our major ISO certifications  
- Established and continue to embed the Three Lines Model. The three lines: Sectors, the Chief Risk Officer and the Risk Team, other functional assurance and the Internal Audit continue to work together contributing to creation and protection of value.  
Continued to deliver our Business Management System transformation on-time and on-cost  
Continued to monitor and regularly report the status of our risk position and associated mitigation plans throughout the year, and perform in-depth reviews of our risks which have been presented to the Board and Risk and Security Committee.  
Continued to engage with our operating Sectors to improve our risk culture

# Viability statement

Assessing the prospects of the Group

This viability statement should be read in conjunction with the Group's Growth strategy on pages 8 - 9.

The Group's corporate planning processes involve the following individual processes covering differing time frames:

- An annual Integrated Strategic Business Plan (ISBP) process that looks at the financial outlook for the following five years. This process commences with an assessment of the orders pipeline producing an order intake scenario. A review of the phased delivery profile of that order intake as well as contracted order backlog, and the cost base required to support this enables generation of low-case, base-case and high-case profit forecasts. Capital expenditure and working capital requirements are also collected, reviewed, approved and an operating cash flow produced for the Plan period. This is then overlaid with inorganic growth assumptions as well as detailed tax, interest, funding and other non-operating assumptions to produce a five year net debt/ cash forecast including relevant covenant / funding metrics;  
- An annual budget process that covers the first year of the five-year planning horizon in detail;  
- A rolling monthly 'latest best estimate' process to assess significant changes to the budget for the year in progress.

The corporate planning process is underpinned by assessing scenarios and risks that encompass a wide spectrum of potential outcomes, both favourable and adverse. The sensitivity analysis undertaken by management explores the resilience of the Group to the potential impact of each of the principal risks set out on pages 59 - 61, and a combination of those risks.

The scenarios are designed to be severe but plausible, and take full account of the availability and likely effectiveness of the mitigating actions (as described on pages 59 - 61) that could be taken to avoid or reduce the impact or occurrence of the underlying risks, and that realistically would be open to them in the circumstances. In considering the likely effectiveness of such actions, the conclusions of the Board's regular monitoring and review of risk and internal control systems, as discussed on page 87, is taken into account.

Alongside the annual review of risk scenarios applied to the strategic plan, performance is rigorously monitored to alert the Board and QinetiQ Leadership Team to the potential crystallisation of a key risk.

We consider that this stress-testing based assessment of the Group's prospects is reasonable in the circumstances of the inherent uncertainty involved.

# The period over which we confirm longer-term viability

The period over which the Directors consider it possible to form a reasonable expectation as to the Group's longer-term viability is the five-year period to 31 March 2029. This period is deemed appropriate as the Group has significant contract cover out to 2029 driven by long term contracts. The Group's financing arrangements cover the majority of this period, as the term loan has been extended to August 2026, with one year extension option to take it to August 2027, and the revolving credit facility has been extended to April 2027 post year-end. This is also the period covered by our strategic planning process and is subject to stress-testing and scenario planning around potential risks. It has been selected because it presents the Board and readers of the annual report with a reasonable degree of confidence whilst still providing an appropriate longer-term outlook.

The ISBP base case assumes the renewal of the Long Term Partnering Agreement (LTPA). A Principles Agreement was signed with the UK MOD for a five year extension during FY24.

# Assessing the viability of the Group

The scenarios applied consider the key risks facing the Group, as summarised in the Risks and Uncertainty section on page 56. These include:

- An environmental risk focusing on a severe flooding event at the Shoeburyness site  
- Sensitivities on growth metrics in the plan such as margin achievement and revenue growth as a result of competitive pressures, macroeconomic environments, P3M capability, disruptive technologies and workforce planning  
- Sensitivities based on our cash position including increased working capital burden  
Sensitivities linked to the economic environment including revenue reduction and FX risk

The impact of each scenario is assessed in terms of revenue, operating profit, net cash/ (debt) and loan covenants (leverage and interest cover ratio). They are considered individually and aggregated through two combined stress-tests, covering financial pressures and poor trading performance.

The Group has significant forecast growth resulting in a return to positive net cash from FY27. The sensitivities assume that the Group continues to have access to Revolving Credit facilities of  $£275\mathrm{m}$  (renewed in April 2024 at  $\mathbf{\nabla}290\mathrm{m}$  to expire in April 2027) and that the term loan of  $\mathbb{E}336\mathrm{m}$  can be extended by one more year (expiring September 2026). This level of liquidity is deemed sufficient for all of the viability scenarios analysed.

The financial impacts are inherently subjective and highly variable, but have provided an indicative assessment to the Board. None of the risks applied individually, or in aggregate, have a material impact on long term viability (in terms of breaching our available facility headroom or associated covenants). Despite being unlikely, the Directors have considered mitigations that could be put in place to offset the risks. The Group has a number of cost control levers that could immediately be drawn on to control cash outflows.

In addition, it continues to explore its portfolio of assets to ensure they remain relevant to the strategic ambition (through disposal of non-core assets). The revolving debt facility has the option to increase further by an additional £125m, prior to considering the reduction of dividends. All of these options can be drawn on to ensure the Group remains a going concern and does not breach covenants.

# Confirmation of longer-term viability

As noted on page 109, the Directors confirm that their assessment of the principal risks facing the Group was robust. Based upon the robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group and their stress-testing based assessment of the Group's prospects, all of which are described in this statement, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period to 31 March 2029.

# Scenarios modelled

# Links to Principal Risks

# Scenario 1 - Major environmental event

For the purposes of this scenario we have assumed a failure at the exposed area that would result in significant flooding. This flooding would, despite mitigation measures, damage the equipment and infrastructure resulting in significant remediation work to safely restore capability.

# Climate change

# Assumptions:

There would be an immediate impact to our ability to deliver. The impact has been modelled through lost backlog, pipeline revenue and reputational damage, together with lost recoveries from staff impacted.

# Scenario 2 - Profit margin downgrade

Profit margin is downgraded as a result of competitive pressure, project execution, inability to achieve supply chain and organisational efficiency savings or a regulatory fine.

P3M Capability  
Health, Safety and Wellbeing  
Competitive Landscape  
Organisational Culture  
Information Security

# Assumptions:

A  $2\%$  reduction in profit margin, no impact on revenue.

The Group therefore continues to adopt the going-concern basis in preparing its financial statements.</td><td>The Group is exposed to various risks and uncertainties, the principal ones being summarised in the &#x27;Principal risks&#x27; section on pages 56 - 61. In reaching its conclusion on the going concern assessment, the Board also considered the findings of the work performed to support the statement on the long term viability of the Company and the Group. As noted below, this included assessing forecasts of severe but plausible downside scenarios and further downside stress testing related to the Company&#x27;s principal risks. Crystallisation of such risks, to the extent not fully mitigated, would lead to a negative impact on the Group&#x27;s financial results but none are deemed sufficiently material to prevent the Group from continuing as a going concern for at least the next 12 months from 23 May 2024.</td></tr></table>

# Section 172 Statement

We are committed to our responsibilities to promote the success of the Group. The Board of QinetiQ Group plc confirms that during the year under review, it has acted in the way that it considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the Group's success for the benefit of its members as a whole, having due regard to the matters set out in section 172(1)(a) to (f) of the Companies Act 2006.

QinetiQ Group plc is a public Company limited by shares, registered in England and Wales No. 4586941.

Typically in large and complex companies such as QinetiQ, the Directors partly fulfil their duties through a governance framework that delegates day-to-day decision-making to the employees of the Company. The Board recognises that such delegation needs to be part of a robust governance structure which covers our values, how we engage with our stakeholders, and how the Board assures itself that the governance structure and systems of controls continue to be robust.

The main methods used by the Directors to perform their duties are outlined below.

This statement and the relevant disclosures referenced on this page summarise how the Board has upheld and discharged its duties, consider.

(a) The likely consequences of any decision in the long term.  
(b) The interests of the Company's employees  
(c) The desirability of the Company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct.  
(d) The need to act fairly between members of the Company.  
(e) The need to foster the Company's business relationships with suppliers, customers and others.  
(f) The impact of the Company's operations on the community and the environment.

See page 67 for relevant disclosures.

# Creating lasting societal value continued

# Our stakeholders and approach to engagement

To deliver responsibly and for the benefit of all stakeholders, we must understand what matters to them. To do this we engage in a variety of ways in an open and transparent manner, with the aim of identifying common goals.

In some cases the Board will engage directly with certain stakeholders, however, the relevant delivery teams will also manage this engagement if they are better-placed to facilitate meaningful engagement.

We consider the stakeholder and relevant issues to ensure that engagement is led by those best-placed to affect any necessary change.

We expect that our approach and how we engage with our stakeholders will continue to evolve as we pursue further growth and geographic expansion, for the benefit of all of our stakeholders.

# Board activity and principal decisions in FY24

The principal decisions taken by the Board in FY24 are detailed on pages 85 to 86. These decisions cover a variety of topics, including capital allocation, succession planning and the Company's 10-year outlook. Due to the nature of these decisions, a variety of stakeholders are considered as part of the Board's discussions.

# Considering long-term consequences s172 link (a)

The Board holds annual strategy meetings which assess the long-term sustainable success of the Group and our impact on our investors, customers, people, and local communities over a 10-year outlook. Our Group Chair and Company Secretary working with the Executive Directors, set a rolling agenda for each Board meeting, including a two-day strategy review to consider the Company's overall purpose and strategy. This is supported by a budget for the following year and both medium and long-term (five and 10-year) financial planning informed by strategic assessments, such as SWOT analysis. These arrangements are supported by external political, institutional, customer and academic inputs. There are also risk management procedures that identify the potential consequences of decisions in the short, medium and long term, so that mitigation plans can be put in place to prevent, reduce or eliminate risks to our business and wider stakeholders (see pages 57 to 61).

//At a time of heightened world conflict, the Company's clear, proportionate and well-embedded system of corporate governance, which effectively supports and guides how we deliver against our mission and objectives, is key to giving our customers, partners and shareholders transparency and confidence in how our Company executes against its strategy. //

The following corporate governance statement provides an overview of the system of governance adopted by the Company and will enable our shareholders to evaluate the manner in which UK Corporate Governance Code Principles and Provisions have been applied by the Company for the year ended 31 March 2024.

# Key Board activities

During this reporting year, the Board has made improvements to its Board Diversity Policy, announced the commencement of a £100m share buyback programme and has overseen a number of changes to the make-up of the Board. The Audit Committee has been planning to implement the changes to the audit, risk and internal control provisions in the recently published 2024 UK Corporate Governance Code, as well as the proposed changes in the non-financial reporting and audit environment.

A fuller summary of the Board's activity during the year can be found on page 87, and further information about the Group's stakeholder engagement can be found on page 65.

I have already covered a number of areas in the Group Chair Statement earlier in this Report, so rather than repeat those comments, I set out below a few further additions.

# Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)

QinetiQ is committed to responsible and sustainable business practice and is proud to be acting as a catalyst, by driving and leading these important issues within our sector. During the year, the Board have had many discussions on how to best keep evolving our approach to ESG matters including our Net-Zero programme and the evolution of non-financial reporting. As part of our regular business review, we are able to oversee and monitor management of ESG aspects, which are being delivered through our ESG function. We are proud of the significant progress made to date on our ESG strategy and programmes, and we continue to support the business in its ambition to embed this further into corporate strategy and decision-making.

# Health, safety and wellbeing

At QinetiQ, health, safety and wellbeing remain our number one priority. Our commitment to look after our people, customers and visitors while ensuring the public is never harmed by the work we do is at the heart of our culture.

This year, considerable effort has been made to further enhance the Company's safety culture, especially at senior leadership level, and further information on health, safety and wellbeing can be found on page 48.

# Culture

Promoting a culture of openness and debate in the Boardroom is one of my key responsibilities as Group Chair, and as a Board we play an important leadership role in promoting the desired culture throughout the organisation. By spending time with the business and its people, the Board and I have seen that the culture and values of QinetiQ (integrity, collaboration and high performance), are clearly embedded and are genuinely lived. In QinetiQ, I have found a culture that is grounded, responsible and humble, where people have confidence in their capabilities and our strategy, with a strong desire to learn and develop. The Company continues to spend considerable time on engagement with our people to embed and harness the benefits of our Company values.

# Board succession and evaluation of the Board's performance

I have already set out in the Group Chair Statement, earlier in the Report, the changes that are being made to the composition of the Board and I will say more about this in the Nominations Committee Report.

Central to setting the correct tone is the review of the Board's own performance. Following on from the external assessment carried out in FY22 and FY23 by Tom Bonham-Carter of The Effective Board LLP, an internal review was conducted in FY24 to assess how the Company is progressing against the last two years' recommendations. Please see pages 97 to 98 for details of the outcome of the review.

# Remuneration

During the year, the Board's Remuneration Committee has focused on ensuring that the Remuneration Policy approved at the 2023 AGM is operating as intended, to reward, retain and incentivise appropriately the Executive Directors who are driving the Company's success. It has done so by seeking to ensure that the Company's remuneration schemes and their outcomes for Executive Directors continue to be transparent, aligned with the Company's strategy and also aligned with the interests of, our shareholders and the returns we deliver to them.

The Company has also continued to enhance the reward schemes for its people, aimed at supporting them with the continued high cost-of-living in a number of its home countries, including additional support through a hardship fund available to those who have been most affected.

against his reappointment as a Director of the Company. Provision 4 of the Code requires the Company to publish an update on the views received from shareholders and actions taken, no later than six months after the shareholder meeting. The Company released an announcement on 14 May 2024 giving further details in this regard. The reason for delay after 20 January 2024 until 14 May 2024 was to enable the Company to make a full response to the issues raised. Further details can be found on page 90.

Further information on compliance with the Code can be found on page 74.

# Annual General Meeting

We are delighted this year to again welcome shareholders to our AGM. The AGM will be held at 11:00 on Thursday 18 July 2024 at the office of Ashurst LLP, London Fruit and Wool Exchange, Duval Square, London E1 6PW. Further details will be provided in our Notice of AGM and on our website

We deliver safely, responsibly and sustainably for the benefit of all our stakeholders

The Board has supported the review and further refinement of the Company's purpose, to ensure it continues to capture the Board's view of the Company, its evolving global strategy and its role in society. Our purpose communicates the Group's strategic direction and intentions to customers, employees, partners, investors, the local communities we work in and its wider stakeholders. Our values make clear our priorities and form the foundations of the Company's culture.

While the Recognition Gala and Thank Q programmes raise awareness of, and recognise and reward, the behaviours that demonstrate our values, there are many other actions which contribute to the creation of a healthy corporate culture. These include:

- Our corporate policies, reviewed and approved by the Board, which set a clear expectation, and mandate, for every member of the workforce to perform the Company's business with integrity and in accordance with applicable laws, including anti-bribery and corruption, anti-slavery and human trafficking, data protection and 'Speak Up' policies and procedures.  
Fair and transparent employee policies and practices which ensure that employees' rights are respected in accordance with applicable laws and employment contracts, together with a number of programmes and initiatives which support the health and wellbeing of our people, develop talent and promote diversity.  
- Supplier protocols and procedures which seek to ensure that our key suppliers operate their businesses and respect their employees' rights in the same way that we do.  
- The application and monthly assessment by business and functional executive teams and the QinetiQ Leadership Team of safety and operational KPIs to enable management to monitor and drive continuous improvements in safety, reliability and efficiency of our services.  
- Implement the work of Group support functions to advise on the Group's policies, procedures and standards at every level and location of the business around the world, including dedicated safety and operational excellence teams, finance, legal and governance teams, procurement, the People function, and the Group internal audit function.

In addition, we as a Board use a number of other methods to understand and monitor the Company's culture and assess whether our people reflect our values. These include:

Reviews, in the Boardroom, of the outcomes of the Company's staff Peakon surveys, customer satisfaction scores and updates on confidential reporting 'Speak Up'. These give us insights into what the Company does well and what could be improved, as well as any particular areas of concern.  
- The employee interaction with the Global Employee Voice (GEV), discussing the issues which matter most to our people  
- Directors' attendance at Company events, such as the bi-annual virtual Global Employee Roadshows.

Through feedback from all of these monitoring activities, the Board is satisfied that the Company's culture is aligned with our values. Where the Peakon surveys, workforce engagement events or other interactions between Directors and employees and other stakeholders, have revealed matters that can be improved upon or have flagged concerns, the Board has discussed these and assured itself that management is putting action plans in place that are designed to drive improvements or address those concerns.

# Safety culture

QinetiQ's Health and Safety strategy sets the direction for how we look after ourselves, each other and our partners. Our Safety culture journey, is constantly progressing and adapting. The Safety Improvement Programme, established by the Board and led by the QLT is driving a step-change in our safety culture. More information on the SIP can be found on page 48.

# Stakeholder engagement

Engagement and collaboration through our value chain is essential. Partnering with our stakeholders, understanding their challenges and managing risks, we can find solutions to enable shared success, sustain our business and benefit all our stakeholders. We have aligned our strategic priorities with the requirements and needs of our stakeholders to enable delivery of profitable, sustainable value. The Board recognises that it has a duty to act in the best interests of the Company for the benefit of its shareholders, as well as considering other stakeholder interests.

In its decision-making, the Board considers all relevant factors, including:

- How the decision would align with the Group's over-reaching purpose  
- The likely short-, medium- and long-term consequences of the decision  
- The value created for our investors  
- The enhancement of our performance created by the decision  
- The potential impacts on our people, local communities and environment of making the decision  
- The need to create strong, mutually-beneficial customer and supplier relationships  
- The Group's commitment to business ethics

The section 172(1) statement on pages 65 to 67 explains how the Directors have had regard to the matters set out in section 172(1)(a) to (f) of the Companies Act 2006, when performing their duty under section 172. The Board aims to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its shareholders as a whole, taking into account the long-term consequences of its decisions while giving due consideration to the interests of the Company's stakeholders (including employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders, as well as the environment and local communities which are impacted by our operations), while also considering the importance of maintaining our reputation for high standards of business conduct. Examples of what that has looked like in practice over the past year can be found as follows:

Shareholders pages 65 to 67 & 90 Employees page 89 Customers/suppliers page 6 Environment pages 36 to 47 Social pages 48 to 53

Further information about how the Directors have accounted for stakeholders in their decision-making is set out on pages 85 to 86.

# Governance structure

This is the structure through which the Company is managed. It has evolved over time, and continues to evolve to meet the needs of the business and the Company's stakeholders. Boards of large companies invariably delegate day-to-day management and decision-making to Executive Management. Directors should maintain oversight of a company's performance and ensure that management is acting in accordance with the strategy and its delegated authorities. At QinetiQ, the culture, values and standards that underpin this delegation help to ensure that when decisions are made, their wider impact has been considered. The Board has reserved certain matters (posted at www.QinetiQ.com) for its own consideration so that it can exercise judgement directly when making major decisions, and in doing so, promoting the success of the Company.

The QLT meets twice a month. It is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Group's activity. The focus of the QLT includes managing the operational performance of the business, delivering the strategy, managing risk, managing regulatory compliance, establishing financial and operational targets and monitoring performance against those targets.

# Composition, succession and evaluation

# Composition of the Board

The Board considers that its composition reflects the requisite balance of skills, experience, challenge and judgement appropriate for the requirements of the business and full Board effectiveness. The skills and experience of the Board's individual members, particularly in the areas of UK defence and security, the commercialisation of innovative technologies, corporate finance and governance, international markets and risk management, have brought both support and challenge to the Group CEO, Group CFO and the QinetiQ Leadership Team during the year.

# Independence

A majority of the Board is comprised of independent Non-executive Directors. The independence of the Non-executive Directors is considered annually by the Nominations Committee, using the independence criteria set out in Provision 10 of the UK Corporate Governance Code. The Group Chair was independent upon his appointment in April 2019 and continues to use objective judgement in his leadership of the Board.

As part of this process, the Board keeps under review the length of tenure of all Directors, as this is a factor when assessing independence. The independence of Susan Searle, who has served on the Board for more than nine years, was again subject to a rigorous review by the Nominations Committee in March 2024. When making this assessment for Susan (who has served on the Board since March 2014), the Nominations Committee based its decision on the fact that Susan continues to demonstrate integrity and independence in her advice and challenge. Susan was not in attendance during the review and the Nominations Committee remains satisfied that the length of her tenure has not impacted on her level of independence or contributions.

# Time commitment

Each Non-executive Director must be able to devote sufficient time to their role as a member of the Board to discharge their responsibilities effectively. As part of the appointment process, consideration is given to assess Non-executive Directors' ability to devote time to an additional directorship.

Prior to undertaking an additional external role or appointment, the Non-executive Directors are asked to confirm that they will continue to have sufficient time to fulfil their commitments to the Company. This means not only attending and preparing for formal Board and Committee meetings, but also making time to understand the business of the Company. The Non-executive Directors' commitment is reviewed as part of the Board and Director evaluation process.

The Group Chair is conscious that some shareholders have concerns regarding Directors taking on too many non-executive roles. Consequently, he has assessed the ability to meet the commitments required by QinetiQ for those members of the Board who hold more than one other Board position, and he is satisfied that all Board members are able to meet the Company's time commitment. In addition to their work on the QinetiQ Board and its Committees, the members of the Board also regularly make themselves available for Board calls, sub-Committee meetings and Executive leadership events and engagement with employees at the Company's global facilities.

Shonaid Jemmett-Page holds appointments in three other companies, Aviva plc, Cordiant Digital Infrastructure Limited and ClearBank Limited. She is the Chair of Cordiant Digital Infrastructure Limited, which is an investment trust listed on the Special Funds Segment of the FTSE, rather than a full operating company. Therefore, by its nature, the time requirements for this role are not as significant as at a FTSE 250 operating company such as QinetiQ. The Group Chair has reviewed Shonaid's current commitments and contribution to the QinetiQ Board, and he confirms that during the year she has provided significant input and advice at QinetiQ's Board and Committee meetings, in particular in her role as the Audit Committee Chair. He is therefore confident and satisfied that Shonaid has the time and availability to commit fully to her role on the QinetiQ Board.

# Board and Committee processes

The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved for its approval, which includes (but is not limited to): strategy, risk appetite and review of Group-wide principal and emerging risks; major M&A, contracts and bids; share capital, debt financing and other liquidity matters; financial results and budgets; key policies; Board and Committee membership; and governance.

Other matters, responsibilities and authorities have been delegated by the Board to its standing Committees, comprising Nominations, Audit, Risk & Security, Remuneration and Disclosure. Any matters outside of the schedule and the responsibility of the Committees fall within the authority of the Group CEO and/or Group CFO. The schedule of matters reserved for the Board and the terms of reference of each Committee, which are regularly reviewed and approved by the Board, can be found on the Company's website at www.QinetiQ.com.

The Group Chair and the Company Secretary are responsible, in consultation with the Group CEO and the Chairs of the Committees, for maintaining a scheduled 12-month programme of business for the Board and its Committees, with flexibility for additional business to be discussed as required. The programme ensures that all necessary matters are covered and appropriate time is given for discussion and, if thought fit, approval of relevant business. At each scheduled Board meeting, the Board rigorously reviews updates from the Executive Directors on Group and operational sector safety, operating and financial performance, investor relations, and from the Group Director Legal & Company Secretary on legal compliance and corporate governance. Other regular Board agenda items include strategic proposals (including those relating to M&A, major contract bids and capital allocation), transformation and digital programme, risk management (including reviews of risk appetite and Group-level risks), tax and treasury updates, pension updates, people updates (including on employee relations, talent development and diversity promotion), and stakeholder engagement. Senior management and external advisers regularly attend both Board and Committee meetings, which allows for detailed and informed discussions on specific matters on which their input or advice is needed.

The Board also seeks to hear external viewpoints inside and outside the Boardroom, including from customers, suppliers and experts in areas relevant to the Company's strategy.

# Composition, succession and evaluation continued

In advance of each Board and Committee meeting, Directors receive, via a secure web portal, high-quality briefings, prepared by the Executive Directors, senior management, the Company Secretary and/or external advisers where appropriate, on the agenda items to be discussed. The secure web portal also gives Directors immediate access to a range of other resources, including previous meeting papers, minutes, financial reports, business presentations, investor reports, Company policies and governance guidelines, and details of Board and Committee procedures. If a Director is unable to attend a meeting due to illness or exceptional circumstances, they will still receive all supporting papers in advance of the meeting and are directed to discuss with, and provide input, opinion and any instructions to, the Group Chair or relevant Committee Chair on the business to be considered at that meeting.

The Board has access to the Company Secretary for support and advice as required, and the Company operates a policy which allows Directors to obtain, at the Company's expense, independent professional advice

where required to enable them to fulfil their duties effectively. In addition to Board and Committee meetings, the Non-executive Directors hold private meetings without the Executive Directors present, including to discuss Executive Director performance. There are also opportunities during the year for Directors to have informal discussions outside the Boardroom, either between themselves or with senior management or external advisers.

# Conflict of interest

The Board operates a policy to identify and manage situations declared by the Directors (in accordance with their legal duty to do so) in which they or their connected persons have, or may have, an actual or potential conflict of interest with the Company. In accordance with the Companies Act 2006, and the Articles of Association, the Board has the authority to authorise conflicts of interest. This ensures that the influence of third parties does not compromise the independent judgement of the Board. Directors are required to declare any potential or actual conflicts of interest that could interfere with their ability to act in the best interest of the Group.

The Company Secretary maintains a conflicts register, which is a record of actual and potential conflicts, together with any Board authorisation of the conflict. The authorisations are for an indefinite period and are reviewed annually by the Nominations Committee, which also considers the effectiveness of the process for authorising Directors' conflicts of interest. The Board reserves the right to vary or terminate these authorisations at any time. No Director conflict of interest currently exists.

# Board and Committee Meetings

During the year, the Board has seven meetings, each scheduled over two days, for Board and Committee business. Additional Board sub-Committee meetings and conference calls are held between the scheduled meetings as required. The table below sets out the Board and Committee membership and attendance by members at meetings held in FY24.

# Board decision-making

In making decisions, the Board of Directors is cognisant of undertaking its legal duties, including its duty under section 172(1), in the way that is most likely to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its members as a whole, and the need to have regard to the factors set out therein; see pages 65 to 67 for more information.

Examples of some of the most important decisions taken by the Board during the year of reporting, and an explanation of which factors the Board had regard to when reaching such decisions, are set out below.

# 1. Share Buy-back Programme

<table><tr><td>Background</td><td>In January 2024 the Company announced a 12-month, £100m share buyback programme.</td></tr><tr><td>Board discussion</td><td>Prior to a decision being made in January 2024 to commence a buyback programme, the Board held a number of meetings to consider and understand various factors which informed their decision: direct feedback from shareholders; advice from the Company&#x27;s brokers; the views of its analysts; considering the application of the Company&#x27;s capital allocation policy, including return of value to shareholders; and considering impact on the Company&#x27;s five-year strategy and planned investments.</td></tr><tr><td>Board stakeholder considerations and impact</td><td>In arriving at its decision, the Board took account of the views of a number of its largest shareholders, through direct engagement at investor roadshows and one-to-one meetings held by the Group Chair. The Board also considered the cost impact the buyback would have on (i) its ability to invest in its facilities for the benefit of delivering to its customers; (ii) investment in operational improvements to reduce its carbon footprint; and (iii) planned investments for the benefits of its employees.</td></tr><tr><td>Outcome and next steps</td><td>The Board concluded that, based on and balancing the various considerations, a share buyback was in the best interests of its investors, including delivering returns on investment in the short term, and could be undertaken at a level of £100m without materially reducing the Company&#x27;s ability to make planned investments in the medium to long term for the benefit of its customer delivery, employees and environmentally focused improvements to its operations.</td></tr></table>

# 2. Board succession planning

<table><tr><td>Background</td><td>FY24 saw a number of planned changes to the composition of the Board, driven by the implementation of succession planning aimed at ensuring the skills and experience of the Board remained best aligned to the Company&#x27;s evolving global strategy and its geographic focus areas, and provided appropriate diversity of experience, culture and thought.</td></tr><tr><td>Board discussion</td><td>Succession planning during the year was supported by discussion at both Nominations Committee and at Board-level, which included input from the CEO and various senior leaders on the strategic focus of the Company and its businesses, and the support an input they would require from the Board, and advice from the Chief People Officer on people strategy and diversity plans within the Company, both of which would need to be well aligned with Board skills, experience and culture.</td></tr><tr><td>Board stakeholder considerations and impact</td><td>In setting its succession plans, the Board took consideration of the Company&#x27;s strategic focus on the AUKUS partnership to meet the needs of its core US, UK and Australian government customers; its investors desire to see continued strong strategic input and direction at Board level, with the right experience to guide the effective growth of the Company, both organically and inorganically; and, from an employee perspective, the support needed for the continuing development of cultural diversity, especially in the areas of gender and ethnicity.</td></tr><tr><td>Outcome and next steps</td><td>During the year, as a result of its succession planning, the Board saw the planned retirement of Michael Harper, with Steve Mogford taking on the role of Senior Independent Director. As well as the appointments of Ross McEwan and Dina Knight who respectively bring additional experience of financial controls and intimate knowledge of the Australian market, and talent management, cultural diversity and leadership in multi-national corporates.</td></tr></table>

Board decision-making continued

3. Ten-year strategic outlook  

<table><tr><td>Background</td><td>Conscious of a dynamic and fast-changing geopolitical environment and rapid advances in disruptive technology enablers, such as artificial intelligence, the Board perceived the need to enhance the Company&#x27;s Integrated Strategic Business Plan (ISBP) process to ensure a longer-term lens was applied to the Company&#x27;s strategic plans.</td></tr><tr><td>Board discussion</td><td>Board considerations included the time horizon for strategic planning; the need for a variety of external views points across industry, political, customer and academic perspectives to fully inform planning; and inputs and information required from the Company&#x27;s businesses to inform the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threat position of the organisation. Board discussion also focused on how the individual Board members could most effectively bring their experience to bear on the long-term strategic decisions of the Company, which required a more interactive engagement in the planning process.</td></tr><tr><td>Board stakeholder considerations and impact</td><td>The Board brought to bear its experience of customer requirements and how those changed in a dynamic geopolitical environment, including where global allies are operating on a war-footing, which would drive how the Company needed to plan and position itself to respond to both changing customer needs and the changing nature of warfare. Thought was also given to potential impacts on partnerships on the Company&#x27;s supply chain and how the Company would need to respond to those dynamics. Employee perspectives included the future changing needs and expectations of employees, and impacts that would have on planning for talent attraction and retention. From an investor perspective, thought was given to the Company&#x27;s ability to set strategy in a way which enabled the rapid realisation of the benefits of critical technology enablers, such as artificial intelligence, in an ethically responsible and organisationally secure way.</td></tr><tr><td>Outcome and next steps</td><td>The FY24 ISBP process was initiated with a revamped approach to the Board Strategy meeting in October 2024, unpinned by a 10-year strategic outlook, beyond the Company&#x27;s usual five-year ISBP process, and informed by external experts who provided longer term perspectives across a combination of industry, politics, customer relationships and academia, and UK, US and Australian geographical axes aligned to the Company&#x27;s core operational centres. Board members&#x27; inputs were gained through interactive scenario setting sessions, providing richer and deeper insights for the strategy planning process. The output of those sessions were fed into the process for constructing the Company&#x27;s FY25 ISBP, which was further reviewed and refined through regular engagement with the Board and its Committees at meetings between November and March 2024.</td></tr></table>

4. Board Diversity Policy update  

<table><tr><td>Background</td><td>The Board considered updates to its Diversity and Inclusion policy to reflect the latest guidance in the UK Corporate Governance Code and from the Parker Review.</td></tr><tr><td>Board discussion</td><td>Board discussions centred on the current diversity culture of the Company and its plans for further development of its diversity and inclusion programmes, taking advice and input from the Chief People Officer, to ensure its own diversity policies were reflective of the Company&#x27;s position and plans, as well as latest corporate governance guidance.</td></tr><tr><td>Board stakeholder considerations and impact</td><td>The Board was cognisant of its ESG commitments, in terms of social responsibility and from a governance perspective, in ensuring that its own diversity and inclusion policies were reflective of the Company&#x27;s own cultural journey, including gender and ethnic diversity, and ensured that the make-up of the Board included the necessary diversity of perspectives and experience needed to recognise and promote opportunities for increased diversity within the Company. A key focus would be to create the diversity of thinking and operating which would ultimately provide benefit to the Company&#x27;s customers and investors by ensuring that its operations and strategic planning harnessed a broad range of experience, skills and perspectives.</td></tr><tr><td>Outcome and next steps</td><td>The Board approved an updated version of its Diversity and Inclusion Policy, and committed to continue to review this through its Nominations Committee on a regular basis.</td></tr></table>

# Management and control of US subsidiaries

QinetiQ's US sector is comprised of QinetiQ Inc and its subsidiary operating companies, including Foster Miller Inc and the Avantis Federal group. These companies operate under a Special Security Agreement (SSA) between QinetiQ and the US Defense Counterintelligence & Security Agency (DCSA), which governs how the rest of the QinetiQ Group interfaces, collaborates and works with the companies in the US sector. The controls established by the SSA are required by the US National Industry Security Program for cleared facilities security, to appropriately mitigate foreign ownership, control or influence to the extent that it could adversely affect the interests of US national security. QinetiQ Group plc, QinetiQ Inc and the US Department of Defense (DoD), represented by the DCSA, are parties to the SSA, which establishes procedures that regulate the management and operation of our US sector, to achieve that mitigation. Under the SSA, the Board of Directors of QinetiQ Inc is comprised of three types of Directors, all nominated by QinetiQ Group plc, as the foreign owner of QinetiQ Inc., and approved by the DCSA. The three types of Director appointments are Outside Directors, Inside Directors and Officer Directors of QinetiQ Inc.

The Inside Directors are the means by which QinetiQ maintains appropriate visibility of the management and operations of the Companies in the US sector. These positions are held by the Group CEO and Group CFO of QinetiQ Group plc. The Inside Directors serve as a minority representative of QinetiQ Group plc as the foreign owner, to ensure there is no undue control or influence on the actions of the US sector. Inside Directors do not need to be US citizens, and are excluded from access to US classified and export-controlled information in possession of QinetiQ Inc and its subsidiaries.

The Officer Directors are responsible for the day-to-day operations of the US sector, and serve as a liaison with the wider QinetiQ Group. These positions are held by Shawn Purvis, President and CEO of the US sector and Andy Maner, who is a consultant to Shawn. The Officer Directors must ensure that the procedures and requirements of the SSA are effectively implemented, and have an obligation to maintain the security of classified and export-controlled information entrusted to QinetiQ Inc and its subsidiaries, as well its ability to perform on classified contracts and participate in classified programmes. They must be resident US citizens who either have, or are eligible to possess, personal US security clearance.

Outside Directors must be resident US citizens who are objective individuals, who have no prior relationship with QinetiQ, and possess personal US security clearance. Our appointed Outside Directors are John Hillen, Chair of the QinetiQ Inc Board, Pamela Drew and Tom Vecchiolla. The number of Outside Directors must outnumber the Inside Directors. The Outside Directors also form the Government Security Committee, which is in place to ensure US national security interests are upheld.

# Approach

The Board is committed to communicating in an open and transparent manner with all shareholders, and places a clear importance on shareholder engagement. The Investor Relations programme is managed by the Investor Relations team, which provides day-to-day contact with investors. This is complemented by engagement with the CEO and CFO, who regularly attend meetings with institutional investors. In addition, the Group Chair and other Non-executive Directors make themselves available to discuss matters such as governance, ESG factors, remuneration and other relevant topics. The Board is also kept up to date on shareholders' views and concerns through regular Board papers, presentations and feedback from the Investor Relations team

The AGM provides an opportunity for shareholders to engage directly with the Board and receive an update on business performance. The Company's results, presentations and other investor events are also webcast live, and made readily available on the company's website, enabling a wider audience to access them.

# Activities during the year

During FY24 the CEO, CFO and Investor Relations team collectively met with over  $30\%$  of the share register, and hosted a number of meetings with non-shareholders. This contact was conducted during routine roadshows after results announcements, ad-hoc roadshows and at various conferences. The Group's Chair, Neil Johnson, engaged with a number of shareholders on governance-related matters and the Chair of the Remuneration Committee, Susan Searle, engaged with shareholders ahead of the AGM on remuneration matters.

This year has seen increasing engagement, particularly with investors in North America. The Investor Relations team and Management held a US Investor Conference and roadshow in November; overall North American institutional ownership of QinetiQ represents  $24\%$  of the share register as at 31 March 2024, increasing from  $22\%$  last year, and  $14\%$  the year before. We continue to be proactive in investor engagement.

# Constructive use of the Annual General Meeting (AGM)

The Notice of AGM and related papers will, unless otherwise noted, be sent to shareholders at least 20 working days before the meeting. For those shareholders who have elected to receive communications electronically, notice is given of the availability of the documents via www.QinetiQ.com. This year's AGM will be held at 11:00 on Thursday 18 July 2024 at the offices of Ashurst LLP, London Fruit and Wool Exchange, 1 Duval Square, London E1 6PW.

After receiving more than  $20\%$  votes against the re-election of its Group Chair at the 2023 AGM, the Company engaged with a number of shareholders to understand the reasons for that. It related to concerns about the number of external Board mandates held by the Group Chair, and the Board composition not including anyone from a minority ethnic background. These concerns have been addressed through the Group Chair having resigned as Chair of Unbound Group plc in July 2023 as part of a planned succession; and the Company having made changes to its Board appointments which promote its objective to achieve and maintain targets on gender and ethnic diversity. More information on the Board's and the Company's progress towards its gender and ethnic diversity targets can be found on page 96.

Any updates to the arrangements for the conduct of the meeting will be communicated via www.QinetiQ.com.

# Confidential reporting process

QinetiQ has in place a Group-wide Speak up programme, which includes a confidential reporting process, and this is detailed on the Company's intranet and in its Code of Conduct. If an individual does not feel that they can resolve any concerns with the Company directly through discussions with their functional manager, they can use an externally provided confidential internet and telephone reporting system. All concerns are passed by the external third party to the Group Director - Internal Audit, who ensures that they are held in strict confidence and properly investigated. Reports on confidential reporting activity and outcome of investigations are reported to the Board at each of its meetings. The Board reviewed the effectiveness of the Group's confidential reporting process, provided challenge and advice on the issues raised, and was satisfied that the process in place is fit for purpose. More information on the Group's Speak up programme can be found on page 54.

# Case study

# Board engagement

In January 2024, Neil Johnson, Steve Wadey, General Sir Gordon Messenger, Steve Mogford and Susan Searle visited the Group's operations and facilities based in Australia, including its recently acquired Air Affairs group. The objective was to gain a deeper understanding of the nature and technical capability of, and risks being managed by, that business; and to engage with a range of people working there, to take a perspective on the issues important to them. Following an overview of the Australia-based operations and its sites, from the Chief Executive and leadership team of the Australia sector, the

Directors visited the Air Operations Centre in Nowra and had a tour of the Air Manufacturing facilities, enabling them to gain an in-depth understanding of the intricacies of operating in a highly-regulated air environment. The Directors also visited the Australia sector headquarters in Canberra; to meet with the sector's extended leadership team and gain insights into the issues and opportunities in the various businesses which operate in the Australia sector, including its plans to leverage its capabilities for the benefit of the AUKUS partnership which comprises three of the Group's core government customers.

A BBQ lunch with employees based at Canberra gave the Directors access to a valuable range of views and perspectives across a broad spectrum of roles within the Australia sector workforce. The visit allowed engagement with a significant number of employees, all of whom have a role to play in delivering a safe and compliant environment for our Australia-based people and facilities. The Directors were able to constructively engage with them to understand the strategy for the Australia sector, and directly input into thinking for its future development.

# Succession planning

# Board and Committees

The Committee annually reviews the composition of the Board and its Committees and the Nominations Committee expects to continue to implement its succession plans for the Board and its Committees in

2024/2025 and beyond. We use the process outlined below to ensure that we continue to recruit only candidates of the highest standard, that we continue to make progress towards our diversity and inclusion targets, and that we have the right balance of an experienced Board, yet with a fresh perspective.

Following this year's review the Committee is satisfied that we have an appropriate mix of skills, knowledge and experience to operate effectively.

<table><tr><td>Process step</td><td>Action</td><td>Outcome/impact</td></tr><tr><td>Identifying current and future needs and skills gaps</td><td>The Committee maintains and regularly reviews a matrix of the Directors&#x27; experience and skills to ensure that the Board and its Committees are composed of individuals who have the right experience and skills to enable them to shape (and, in the case of the Executive Directors, deliver) the Company&#x27;s strategy and to monitor and assess the effectiveness of the Company&#x27;s control environment and management of risk.
The matrix considers the following:
- Diversity, including age, gender and ethnicity
- Background, professional skills and experience
- The number and balance of Executive and Non-executive Directors
- Length of tenure
- Independence</td><td>- The appointment of Ross McEwan and Dina Knight as Non-executive Directors
- At the conclusion of the 2023 Annual General Meeting, Michael Harper stepped down as a Director of the Company, and Steve Mogford assumed the role of Senior Independent Director thereafter.</td></tr><tr><td>Ensuring that we get access to the best candidates</td><td>Regularly reviewing the recruitment agencies that we use to ensure that they are best placed to find QinetiQ the right mix of candidates capturing the clear benefits of greater diversity. In addition, we pick the best suited agency for the specific role currently recruited for.</td><td>Odgers (who has no other connection to the Group or to any individual Directors) was used for the recruitment of Dina Knight. No recruitment agency was used for the recruitment of Ross McEwan.</td></tr><tr><td>Ensuring accountability and success of the Board&#x27;s performance</td><td>- Annual Board effectiveness and performance evaluation, using an external provider every three years. See more on pages 97 to 98
- Annual review of the Group Chair&#x27;s performance led by the Senior Independent Director. See more on page 99
- Annual independence review of the Non-executive Directors. See more on page 83
- Continued assessment of the Non-executive Directors&#x27; time commitment. See more on page 83
- Policy on Board members&#x27; appointments to other Boards
- Annual performance review of the CEO and CFO, supplemented by the Group Chair&#x27;s and Non-executive Directors&#x27; continual assessment of their performance. See more on page 99
- A thorough induction programme for new Directors. See more on page 99
- Annual training for the Board as a whole and on an individual basis. See more on page 99</td><td>- The FY24 Board effectiveness review concluded that the Board has been effective, engaged with and helpful to the organisation
- A summary of the Board&#x27;s decision-making, considering section 172(1) can be found on pages 65 to 67</td></tr></table>

The effectiveness of the Committee's succession plans is demonstrated by the appointment in FY24 of Ross McEwan and Dina Knight, who have further enhanced the Board's experience in financial controls, talent management and corporate strategy. Ross brings valuable Executive and Non-executive Director experience as well as intimate knowledge of the Australian market, while Dina has great experience of executive leadership in multinational corporates.

The process that the Committee has established, together with the particular considerations it takes into account, in identifying and nominating Director candidates, is set out below.

<table><tr><td colspan="4">A sub-Committee of the Nominations Committee is appointed to oversee the recruitment and appointment process</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">A tender process identifies the most suitable recruitment agency to conduct the search and prepare candidate specifications</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">The sub-Committee reviews the list of candidates and narrows down to a short-list of those who best meet the Company&#x27;s requirements, considering the following:</td></tr><tr><td>Background, skills and experience</td><td>Independence and other commitments</td><td>Diversity</td><td>Other individual attributes to widen the Board&#x27;s overall knowledge, providing challenge and further support</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">The sub-Committee conducts initial interviews with the candidates on the short-list and identifies preferred candidates</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Other Board members, including the Group CEO and Group CFO, interview the preferred candidates</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Nominations Committee recommends to the Board which of the preferred candidates best fulfils the Board&#x27;s and its Committees&#x27; needs</td></tr><tr><td>Senior management succession planning programme
The Committee has undertaken its usual programme of senior management succession planning. Senior management for this purpose includes the members of the QinetiQ Leadership Team, as well as those talented individuals who have demonstrated the potential for promotion to higher or broader positions in the Group&#x27;s senior management structure.
The programme includes an annual review of such senior managers&#x27; experience and skills and their progress and notable achievements to ascertain their potential for further career progression. The Committee also keeps the performance of potential successors to Executive Director roles under regular review throughout the year during Board interactions and visits to the Company&#x27;s operations.</td><td>This gives Committee members the opportunity to observe senior managers&#x27; working practices and relationships with their stakeholders first-hand. These reviews complement the Executive Directors&#x27; assessment of these individuals&#x27; performance through a formal process of annual reviews and continual feedback and support. This programme enables the Committee to identify any gaps in the senior management succession pipeline and any requirements for senior managers&#x27; further development.
In FY24, the Group&#x27;s leadership has embedded the new operating model, implemented in the previous year, which was restructured into four sectors, supported by six Group functions.</td><td colspan="2">This year has seen further focus on both promotion of internal talent and the strengthening of key aspects of the executive QinetiQ Leadership Team. This has resulted in leadership changes announced in April 2024, including the recruitment of Martin Cooper as a new CFO and Iain Stephenson in a newly created Chief Operating Officer role, as well as the internal promotion of Will Blamey to Chief Executive UK Defence.</td></tr></table>

# Board and company commitment to diversity

The Board is committed to ensuring diversity in all aspects (including as regards to gender, ethnic and social background), at Board and senior management-level and throughout the Company's employees. This is because we believe diversity can:

- Improve decision-making at all levels of the business by ensuring diverse perspectives
- Attract and retain the best talent with a culture of inclusion where all individuals are respected and supported to reach their full potential  
- Better serve our customers, other stakeholders and the communities in which we operate by ensuring that the diversity of our workforce demographic is representative of the diversity of such stakeholders

This commitment is aligned with our values (see more on page 76), which in turn support our strategy of growth by retaining and winning business through having the best talent delivering the best service for our customers.

# Board Diversity Policy

Our commitment is confirmed in the Board's Diversity Policy, which has been updated and strengthened this year, and which applies to the Board and all of its Committees - the main objectives of which are:

- To achieve and maintain targets on gender and ethnic diversity on the Board and its Committees  
- To ensure that the membership of the Board and its Committees reflects the diversity of the geographies and communities we operate in, and the customers that the Group serves  
- To respect the differences of its members, and value and encourage the diversity of thought that such differences can bring - in each case within the context of Board members having, between them, the experience and skills required to support the development, oversight and delivery of the Company's strategy

We are pleased to have seen the positive benefits to these initiatives, which have resulted in improvements in both gender and ethnic diversity at a number of levels of the business, including:

- One member of the Board comes from an ethnic minority background  
- The Audit and Remuneration Committee Chairs are female

Female representation on the QLT has increased from  $36.4\%$  in 2023 to  $40\%$  in 2024  
Female representations of the direct reports to the QLT has remained at  $27\%$ , and remains a key area of focus  
- Data obtained on a voluntary basis through a secure electronic portal detailing the ethnic representation of the senior management team.

Further to the appointment of Dina Knight in March 2024, the Company has, as at 31 March 2024, met the following targets, as referenced in Listing Rule 9.8.6(9): that one of the senior positions on the Board (Chair, CEO, SID or CFO) is held by a woman and that there should be a Director from a minority ethnic background on the Board. Although we note the subsequent departure of our CFO Carol Borg at the beginning of FY25 has taken us below the targets, we believe that our established and effective process, as outlined above, will help us once again achieve and maintain these important targets in the future. The Company's mandatory requirement for a diverse candidate pool ensures that we continue to have the opportunity to recruit candidates from all gender, cultural and ethnic backgrounds, while we remain focused on recruiting the best candidate for any role based on merit.

Voluntary disclosures required under Listing Rule 9.8.6 as at 31 March 2024

The above data was obtained on a voluntary self-reported basis. Participants were invited to provide information through a secure electronic portal, wherein they were asked to share detail such as ethnic background. As part of our inclusion, Diversity and Belonging strategy, we are focusing on increasing our ethnic minority representation within our Senior Management team by the end of 2027. This will be achieved through creating diverse recruitment and talent pipelines and creating an inclusive culture where everyone can feel they belong and thrive.

# Year 1

FY22 - External evaluation by selected independent consultants (specific basis and approach agreed)

# Year 2

FY23 - External evaluation to focus on reviewing core effectiveness and areas identified for development from the Year 1 external evaluation

# Year 3

FY24 - Internal evaluation to focus on reviewing progress made on areas identified for development from the Year 2 external evaluation and identify any gaps where further action is required to improve

# The employee Inclusion, Diversity and Belonging Strategy

Pages 49 to 53 describe the progress of our Inclusion, Diversity and Belonging Strategy in relation to employees and other diversity policies and procedures of the Company.

Our Inclusion, Diversity and Belonging strategy can be found on www.QinetiQ.com which outlines our approach to creating an environment where everyone feels they belong and can thrive. We encourage inclusion and diversity to be fully embraced in our workplace so that each and every one of our colleagues can be themselves, fulfil their potential and feel inspired to deliver for our customers.

The effectiveness of the policy is governed by our assurance processes and with oversight by our Executive Team. To help us reach our goals we have various tools in place, including global employee mandatory training, inclusive leadership development and employee network groups. During the year we continued to see an increase in employee activity and engagement around Diversity and Inclusion including the launch of a global 'Count Me In' campaign enabling employees to voluntarily share information about their diversity to inform our strategic priorities. We are confident that this focus will continue in 2024 and beyond to ensure we create an environment where people have a true sense of belonging, enabling us to attract and retain the very best people who will make us a stronger company.

# Director effectiveness

A performance evaluation of the Board, its Committees and the individual Directors is conducted annually, with an externally facilitated review required at least every three years. As illustrated by the adjacent chart, FY22 was the first in the three-year cycle when an external evaluation was undertaken by Tom Bonham-Carter of The Effective Board LLP. In FY23 a follow-up independent review was undertaken through The Effective Board LLP. Neither Tom Bonham-Carter, nor The Effective Board LLP has any other connection to the Group. In FY24 an internal review was undertaken to identify whether further actions were required to meet recommendations made in the FY22 and FY23 external reviews.

The principal sources of data used to assess the effectiveness of the Board and its Committees were questionnaires completed by each Board member, the Company Secretary and a selection of members of the senior management team.

The FY22 and FY23 reviews were designed to understand whether the Directors have thoroughly discussed and agreed the use and investment of the shareholders' funds to ensure the Company is successful while managing the risks inherent in its strategy, operational plans and operating environment. This was augmented by an assessment of how effective the Board is in ensuring that the Executive team implements the strategy and plans and manages all the other activities of the Company including engaging across the spectrum of its stakeholders.

The FY24 internal review analysed evidential progress against recommendations made in the FY22 and FY23 reviews and identified any potential gaps in recommendations being met. The questionnaires were designed to understand the need for further actions to be taken to address gaps and what those actions should be.

The Company Secretary, in consultation with the Group Chair and Committee Chairs, analysed the results of the evaluation by reference to the scores given, the specific observations made, and any recommendations given or improvements suggested. Following which, those results were presented to and discussed by the Board and its Committees.

The overall outcomes of the evaluations were positive, evidencing that significant improvements had been made, acting on the prior two year's recommendations, and demonstrating that the Board and each of its Committees continue to function effectively with a high level of probity, integrity and independence, through the mediums of both open and challenging debate in meetings and appropriate engagements outside of meetings.

# Director effectiveness continued

The key strengths and material areas for further attention identified by the FY24 Board and Committee evaluation are shown below:

<table><tr><td>Key strengths</td><td>Areas for further attention</td></tr><tr><td>The Board has evolved its review of the Group strategy to ensure that a longer five to 10-year view is taken when considering factors that impact the operational, financial and competitive performance of the Company&#x27;s businesses; to take into account broad external perspectives; and to support its review with SWOT analysis. This has increased the effectiveness of the Board&#x27;s support to the development and implementation of the Company&#x27;s strategy, aligned to its purpose and vision.</td><td>Achieving a deeper level of Board understanding of material risks in the Company&#x27;s supply chain and how those risks are managed and mitigated by its businesses.</td></tr><tr><td>The Board has continued to work well as a unit during the year, with Board discussions being constructive and appropriately challenging, the Executive Directors being transparent with the Board and open to advice. This way of working has been effectively preserved throughout the recent planned changes to the Board&#x27;s composition.</td><td>Supporting the further maturation of the Company&#x27;s Three Lines Model within its Group-wide control and assurance framework, including the embedding of defined roles and responsibilities for the first and second lines of assurance</td></tr><tr><td>The Board has further strengthened its oversight of, and input to, the Company&#x27;s ESG agenda. This has included a particular focus on progress against the Net-Zero plan and implementation of non-financial reporting on climate change, including TCFD, and planning for development of internal controls to meet the upcoming changes to the UK Corporate Governance Code. This has been enabled by review of both of these areas at each Audit Committee meeting during the year. See more information on ESG on page 34.</td><td>Undertaking re-assessment of the Board&#x27;s skills and experience, following a number of recent changes in Board composition, to be reflected in an update to the Board&#x27;s skills matrix, aligned to the Company&#x27;s evolving strategy</td></tr></table>

When comparing the outcome of the FY24 evaluation against principal areas for improvement identified through the FY23 review process, the following progress has been seen:

<table><tr><td>Areas for further attention</td><td>Progress during the year</td></tr><tr><td>Increased assessment of emerging risks which have impacted the Company and lessons learned as a result. A specific example being assessment of the effectiveness of business continuity plans and procedures</td><td>The Annual Planners of matters considered by the Board and its Committees have been further evolved to ensure regular Board updates and oversight of (i) the operational performance of the Company&#x27;s four business sectors; (ii) the strategic development and operational delivery of its four Global Campaigns; and (iii) deep dives in to areas of key transformational improvement across its Group. These have included tangible examples of emerging risk issues which have affected areas of the business, business continuity response to those issues and actions taken to mitigate the impact of those risks. This has allowed the Board to engage in lessons learned from such risk issues and input into improvements made to better manage emerging risk issues.</td></tr><tr><td>Review needed for improvements to the Group-wide control and assurance framework, including clarity between the roles and responsibilities of the first and second lines of assurance within the company&#x27;s ‘three lines model’</td><td>Throughout the year, the Board has been actively engaged in evaluating and inputting guidance into the Company&#x27;s programme for strengthening and maturing its Three Lines Model, with a particular focus on improvements required to its first-line capability and second-line controls. This has been facilitated through updates to the Board and its Committees by the Chief Risk Officer and Group Director Internal Audit; facilitated workshops outside of the regular Board meeting cycle; the provision of more granular data enabling the Board to assess progress against improvement plans; and site visits allowing members of the Board to gain tangible and contextualised insights into the control environment for some of the Company&#x27;s more highly regulated operations.</td></tr></table>

# The Group Chair's individual performance

As part of our annual evaluation process, Steve Mogford, as Senior Independent Director, led a review of the Group Chair's performance. At a private meeting, the Non-executive Directors, with input from the Executive Directors, assessed the Group Chair's ability to fulfil his role as such. It was concluded that the he showed effective leadership of the Board and his actions continued to influence the Board and the wider organisation positively.

# The Directors' individual performances

The Group Chair, Neil Johnson, held performance meetings with each Board member to discuss their individual contribution and performance over the year, and their future training and development needs. Following these meetings, Neil Johnson confirmed to the Nominations Committee that, during the year, all Directors have demonstrated a clear commitment to their roles.

# Director induction

On joining the Board, whether in an Executive or Non-executive role, each Director undertakes an induction programme covering subject areas relevant to the requirements of their role. This programme is designed to fast-track a new Director's understanding of the Group's purpose, values, strategy and operations, thereby equipping them to perform their role.

Details of the induction programme, organised by the Company Secretary in conjunction with the Group Chair, for new Non-executive Directors, is illustrated by the diagram below.

Background reading material, including previous Board and Committee books, investor and strategy presentations, relevant Company procedures and Board policies

Meetings with the Group Chair, Executive Directors and members of senior management

Guidance on corporate governance arrangements, including the Board and Committee agendas and procedures, Board succession-planning and Board evaluation provided by the Company Secretary

Visits to Company sites, meeting with senior local management

Meetings with the Chair of the Committees, external auditors and external remuneration advisers

# Meetings and Director site visits

Physical Board meetings and Director visits are scheduled throughout the year at our sites, both in the UK and internationally. Locations for meetings and site visits are agreed annually and are arranged by the Company Secretary with assistance from the QLT as appropriate.

During the year the Board held physical meetings in Farnborough, London and Portsmouth in the UK, as well as some Board meetings that continue to be held virtually.

In May 2023, the Group Chair paid a visit to our Inzpire business headquarters in Lincoln, where he received briefings, including the DMI project in Qatar, and had a demonstration of both GECO and JTAC Case firsthand. He was able to engage with Early Careers employees and plans for further developing their career opportunities.

In July 2023 the Group Chair visited the Applecross site and MOD Hebrides, and in October he visited the Haslar site.

In September 2023 Shonaid Jemmett-Page, General Sir Gordon Messenger and Steve Mogford spent two days visiting MOD Pendine and MOD Aberporth.

In January 2024 a number of the Directors visited sites in Australia. For more information on this trip see page 91.

# Ongoing Director training

The Directors have the opportunity to participate in an ongoing training programme organised by the Company Secretary. This includes the Company Secretary keeping the Board briefed on relevant regulatory changes, and arranging external training, as required.

During the year PwC briefed the Board on forthcoming changes to the external audit and governance environment and training on safety was provided to the Board, including a special session on the use of defibrillators.

Further training on recent legal and regulatory updates, as well as further safety and security training is planned for FY25.

//We continue to strive for continuous improvement and I am proud of the progress that has been made this year in enhancing the internal control environment. //

# Dear Shareholder,

I am pleased to present the report of the Audit Committee for the work carried out by the Committee over the course of the year. This report outlines the key topics the Committee has considered during FY24 and how it has discharged the responsibilities.

The main purpose of the Committee continues to be the oversight of a robust system of internal controls and risk management across the business. This includes considering both financial and non-financial risks and ensuring the integrity of all reporting, including the Annual Report and Accounts. The key areas for focus, which are addressed by the internal audit plan, the approach of the external auditors and 'deep dive' reviews are determined by the needs of the business and the risks it faces. The full terms of reference of the Committee can be found at www.QinetiQ.com.

We continue to strive for continuous improvement and I am proud of the progress that has been made this year in enhancing the internal control environment, including evolving the assurance model with the risk function in alignment with the updated UK corporate governance code. A particular focus during FY24 was the Group's capital allocation model, with discussion around the priorities for capital allocation and the £100m share buyback programme which was initiated during the second half of the financial year.

The US continues to be an area of focus for the business and therefore for the Committee. This year has seen the first year of post-acquisition performance of the Avantus business, which has been a key topic during the year. As the business continues to evolve and the integration progresses, we need to ensure that there remains a robust system of internal control and risk management which is appropriate for the scale of operations in the US. The Committee maintains regular dialogue with the US Special Security Arrangement (SSA) Audit Committee, regarding scope and coverage and the sharing of best practice.

The Committee continues to embrace the relevant aspects of the evolving sustainability agenda, including target-setting, assurance and reporting. The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) reporting, on pages 34 - 55, have been reviewed and endorsed by the Committee.

In May 2023 the FRC published its Audit Committees and the External Audit: Minimum Standard. The Committee is content that it meets the relevant responsibilities set out in the Standard.

I hope you find the information in this report about the Committee's work helpful and I will be pleased to answer any questions you have about it at this year's AGM.

# Activities during the year

# Financial reporting

Following the Group entering into a net debt position for the first time in several years in FY23, the Committee held deep-dive sessions into covenant management, operating cash performance management and foreign exchange management. Foreign exchange management is increasingly important with the expansion of overseas operations and the associated internal financing arrangements.

The Committee again spent significant time reviewing the critical accounting estimates and judgments inherent within the annual financial results. These include judgments relating to the Group's complex long-term contract accounting, the assumptions within the Goodwill Impairment calculations, the quality of income generated during the year and the distinction between specific adjusting items and those which impact underlying performance. The quality of income review includes considering one-off items such as provision releases within the income statement and the overall sustainability of earnings. The assessment informs the Committee's work on whether the accounts are fair, balanced and understandable, and whether any adjustments should be considered in remuneration calculations.

# Fair, balanced and understandable

In accordance with the Code, the Board has established processes to ensure that all reports and information it is required to present in accordance with regulatory requirements, represent a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the Company's performance, position and prospects.

As such, the Audit Committee was requested to provide advice to the Board on whether the FY24 Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, provide a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the Company's financial position and future prospects and provide all information necessary to a shareholder to assess the Group's performance, business model and strategy.

Following the established process, the Committee reflected on the information it had received and its discussions throughout the year. The review is a well-established and documented process involving senior management and the core reporting team. The assessment was assisted by an internal verification of the factual content by management, a review at different levels of the Group to ensure consistency and overall balance, and a comprehensive review by the senior management team and the external auditors.

The Board considers that the FY24 Annual Report and Accounts, taken as whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the company's position, and performance, business model and strategy.

Rigour over non-financial reporting (TCFD and other sustainability metrics) In FY22 we were one of the first companies required to report, in line with Listing Rule 9.8.6(R)(8) which addresses the four TCFD recommendation pillars (Governance, Strategy Risk and Metrics) and 11 disclosures. We are committed to continuous improvement as guidance and methodologies mature. For the FY24 reporting (see pages 43 - 47) aligned with the TCFD and BEIS recommendations, we are able to demonstrate a number of refinements for example reviewing and updating our risk profile. The Committee reviewed the propose disclosures and endorsed assumptions and judgements applied by management.

With the growing body of non-financial reporting requirements ahead, the Committee have a standing agenda item to continue to be briefed regularly on this evolving area of interest. An overview of the various new requirements across relevant geographies was discussed, including the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) sustainability-related financial reporting standards; reporting in both the US and Australia and the next steps and investment needed. The Audit Committee charter has been extended into ESG, which strengthens the Audit Committee's oversight of non-financial reporting (including TCFD), increasing its reviews to quarterly.

# Internal financial controls

Internal financial controls are the systems that the Group employs to support the Board in discharging its responsibilities for financial matters and the financial reporting process.

# The main elements include

- Assessment by Internal Audit of the effectiveness of operational controls  
- Clear terms of reference setting out the duties of the Board and its Committees, with delegation to management in all locations  
- Group Finance and Group Tax and Treasury manuals outlining accounting policies, processes and controls  
- Weekly, monthly and annual reporting cycles, including targets approved by the Board and regular forecast updates  
- Leadership teams reviews of results against forecast and agreed performance metrics and targets with overall performance reviewed at region and Group levels  
Specific reporting systems covering treasury operations, major investment projects and legal and insurance activities, which are reviewed by the Board and its Committees on a regular basis  
- Confidential reporting procedures allowing individuals to report fraud or financial irregularities and other matters of concern without risk of retaliation  
Data protection policies to detect breaches and other issues

Key issues and Judgements impacting FY24 accounts  

<table><tr><td>Issue</td><td>Key uncertainties and judgement</td><td>Review and challenge</td><td>Conclusion</td></tr><tr><td>Impairment of goodwill and acquired intangibles</td><td>The Group holds goodwill on its balance sheet in respect of various Cash Generating Units (CGUs). 
An impairment review has been undertaken confirming that sufficient headroom (the gap between the assessed net present value of future cash flows and the carrying value of net operating assets) exists in respect of these CGUs and no impairment is required. 
There is a reduced level of headroom in respect of the US CGUs however applying a reasonable level of sensitivity to the assumptions would not lead to an impairment.</td><td>The Committee reviewed the outputs of management&#x27;s annual impairment testing exercise, noting the use of external advisors to prepare the technical assumptions (discount rates, long term-inflation) which have also been verified as appropriate by the external auditors. 
The Committee held detailed discussions with management and the external audit team, specifically challenging revenue and profit assumptions, as well as the technical assumptions.</td><td>There are a wide range of outcomes to the impairment test which is very sensitive to outer year cash flows. On challenging management, the Committee concluded that no impairments need to be recorded in the year. The committee also agreed that the disclosures made within the financial statements were adequate.</td></tr><tr><td>Long-term contract accounting 
Risk assessment on key contracts</td><td>The Group has a large number of contracts which span multiple periods and are accounted for on a percentage of completion&#x27; basis in accordance with IFRS 15. 
Long-term contract accounting requires a number of judgements and management estimates to be made, particularly in calculating the forecast costs to complete the contract, and resultant contract profitability.</td><td>The Committee received commentary from both management and the external auditors in respect of the most significant contracts being delivered by the Group and discussed the main financial assumptions (including level of risk reserves, assumed forecast savings challenges and the use of Monte-Carlo modelling).</td><td>The Committee concluded that management&#x27;s best estimates were reasonable.</td></tr><tr><td>Provisions and contingent liabilities 
Pendine and other provisions</td><td>The Group holds provisions in respect of legal, regulatory and environmental issues. Judgement is required in determining whether provisions are required. 
Specifically, a provision is held in respect of a serious incident at the MOD range at Pendine in a previous financial year.</td><td>The key judgements considered by the Committee were: (i) the likelihood of QinetiQ being prosecuted, found guilty and subject to financial penalties; (ii) the quantum of the liability in respect of such penalties; (iii) that insurance will cover the cost of any civil damages (with a provision of c£12.8m being recorded together with an equally offsetting Other Receivable).</td><td>The Committee concluded that management&#x27;s best estimates were reasonable.</td></tr><tr><td>Specific 
adjusting item Digital investment 
Acquisition 
and disposal related costs</td><td>The Group reports underlying performance which excludes the impact of specific adjusting items. 
Following the change in accounting policy relating to the capitalisation of intangible assets for software as a service, the ongoing one-off period of digital investment is included as a specific adjusting item. 
Specific adjusting items also include a number of acquisition and disposal related costs including post-acquisition integration costs and one-off post-acquisition remuneration costs.</td><td>The Committee receives an update on the nature and quantum of specific adjusting items, as well as management assessment as to their appropriate use.</td><td>The Committee agreed with management&#x27;s assessment that the current Digital investment and other such items are distorting in nature and it is therefore helpful to the reader to separate their impact.</td></tr></table>

<table><tr><td>Issue</td><td>Key uncertainties and judgement</td><td>Review and challenge</td><td>Conclusion</td></tr><tr><td>Pensions
Net pension asset valuation</td><td>The Group&#x27;s net pension asset increased during the year, with a significant increase in the value of the assets being partially offset by changes in the demographic assumptions and liability experience data.</td><td>The Committee reviewed and challenged the results of the valuation exercise, and the key assumptions used, noting the use of external advisers to prepare the calculations.</td><td>The Committee concluded that the assumptions and outputs made by management and the external advisers were reasonable.</td></tr><tr><td>Taxation
Key judgments including recoverability of losses</td><td>The key accounting assumptions relating to tax include tax provisioning, acquisition related tax balances, the recoverability of deferred tax balances relating to historical losses and the impact of statutory rate changes.</td><td>The Committee reviewed and challenged the key judgments taken by management, particularly relating to the future recoverability of deferred tax relating to losses, which will depend on the future financial results of the relevant entities.</td><td>The Committee concluded that the judgments made by management were reasonable.</td></tr></table>

# Going concern and long term viability statements

The acquisitions of Avantus and Air Affairs during FY23 took the Group into a net debt position. It has been pleasing to see leverage reduce during FY24 and we continue to pay particular attention to these assessments, specifically considering if covenants may be breached, debt capacity and the implications of the share buyback programme which was announced in the year. With consideration to the available information, following review and challenge, the Committee concluded that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they become due through to 31 March 2029. The Committee considered it appropriate that the long term viability statement covers a five-year period. In reaching its conclusion, the Committee reviewed the budget for the next financial year, the five-year forecast, the stress tests applied and the mitigating actions available to the Company. The viability statement and the going concern statement can be found in full on pages 62 - 64, including the detail on how the process was conducted.

# Internal Audit

The Group Internal Audit function operates independently within the business, as part of the third line under QinetiQ's adoption of the Three Lines Model (see page 57 for further details). The function is well integrated within the business, providing an independent input to help maintain a robust system of risk management and internal control, and also to ensure there remains a collaborative approach to assurance across the Group.

Group Internal Audit have formally reported to the Audit Committee four times during the year. The Committee approves the annual audit plan, reviews findings, and assesses the overall effectiveness of the internal audit process. A key aim for the audit plan is to ensure that significant financial and non-financial risks are reviewed within a rolling four year period.

The audit plan was built around a number of priorities including a US integration review, a review of the internal cultural change programme, an assessment of large contract renewal and facilities management processes, and a review of the operating model adoption across the Group. The overall assessment following the audit and assurance activity is that the control environment is considered effective, with a culture conducive to improving internal controls and risk management processes.

The effectiveness of the Group Internal Audit function, and the internal assurance model more generally, was assessed by the Committee in the year using a survey and questionnaire completed by members of the Committee, the external auditors, and a number of senior managers from across the business. The outcome was that the Group Internal Audit function remains effective in its activities, noting the period of transition in the last 12 months, as a new team has been built.

Looking forward into the next financial year the Committee recognise the importance of addressing the new UK corporate governance requirements including those relating to material risks and controls whilst allowing sufficient time to provide assurance over other key internal projects such as the business systems upgrade in the UK and Australia. Other priorities include the Group-wide project management improvement programme and fraud risk management, which is planned to be reviewed following the release of new UK legislation.

# Risk Management

The Group Risk Management function operates independently within the business, as part of the second line under QinetiQ's adoption of the Three Lines Model (see page 57 for further details). The function works closely with the business, providing an independent input to help develop a robust system of risk management and internal control, and also to ensure there remains a collaborative approach to assurance across the business. The Committee notes the continual activity to monitor the risk landscape and ensure the principal risks to the business are mitigated effectively through robust and transparent risk management activity.

# Treasury strategy and compliance

The Group Treasury policies and procedures provide a robust framework of internal controls for the management of treasury risks faced in a net debt environment. These include monitoring of leverage and availability of liquidity through Group cash forecasting, meeting our covenant compliance and legal requirements for our banking partners, and managing our financial exposures to foreign exchange and interest rate fluctuations.

The Committee continually challenges and reviews this framework to ensure that it is fit for purpose and robust to meet the changing nature of financial and counterparty risks, the new higher interest rate environment and the banking sector's policies on investing in the defence sector, which impact the availability of liquidity.

# Tax strategy and compliance

The Group Tax policies and procedures provide the framework of internal controls for the management of tax risks for the growing business in an ever-changing global regulatory environment, in which tax transparency has increasing prominence. The Committee reviews the Group's tax affairs annually, which includes considering the Group Tax Strategy, status of any tax audits and filings, tax accounting judgements and disclosures, the structuring of key transactions and important regulatory changes. Group tax policies and procedures were tested last year with the identification of a significant VAT error and the issuance of a suspended penalty by the tax authority. The matter has now been resolved without any penalties in large part due to the Group's open and transparent approach with the tax authority.

# External Audit

# PwC audit scope

Consistent with last year QinetiQ Australia, QinetiQ Inc. (C5ISR) and QinetiQ Limited, are full scope. Following its first full year of trading post the acquisition, and its significance to the Group's overall results, Avantus has been included as a full scope component in the FY24 audit. The scope for Foster Miller Inc. (Technology Solutions) consists of audit procedures being performed over Cash and cash equivalents, Inventory, Revenue and associated balances only. Consistent with the prior year, QinetiQ Target Systems Limited is also in scope for inventory only. The Committee viewed it appropriate for the audit scope to be enhanced for Avantus so as to provide sufficient audit coverage over the consolidated financial statements.

# Non-audit work and auditors' independence

The Committee is responsible for the Group's policy, the Code of Practice on non-audit services and the approval of non-audit services. The Code of Practice is applicable to all employees and sets out the principles for regulating the award of non-audit work to the external auditors.

To safeguard the auditor's independence and objectivity, and in accordance with the 2019 FRC's ethical standard, the Group does not engage PwC for any non-audit services except where it is work that they must, or are clearly best suited to perform. Accordingly, the Group's policy for the engagement of the auditors to undertake non-audit services broadly limit these to audit-related services such as reporting to lenders and grant providers, where there is a requirement by law or regulation to perform the work. All other non-audit services are considered on a case-by-case basis in light of the requirements of the ethical standards and in compliance with the Group's own policy.

The Committee approves the terms of all audit services as well as permitted audit-related and non-audit services in advance. Pursuant to the Code of Practice, any non-audit services conducted by the external auditors require the prior consent of the Group Chief Financial Officer or the Chair of the Audit Committee, and any services exceeding £50,000 in value require the prior consent of the Committee as a whole. For work that is permissible by type, the Committee will take into consideration the size of the contract in proportion to the Group's revenue and profit, and also the total size when

aggregated with other contracts with PwC, noting that some non-auditing services are subject to an annual regulatory  $70\%$  spending cap of the average of the audit fees billed over the last three year period.

It is also the Group's policy that no former PwC employee may be appointed to a senior position within the Group without the prior approval of the Group Chief Financial Officer.

# Review of non-audit work during the year

The Committee reviews the cost and nature of non-audit work undertaken by the external auditors at three meetings during the financial year as a standing item, with a fourth meeting considering the auditor's fees as part of the year-end review. The Committee concluded, prior to engaging PwC for the provision of these services, that there had not been any conflict of interest that might compromise the independence of PwC's audit. Fees paid to PwC are set out in note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 151.

Non-audit related fees paid to the auditor CinetiQ Group plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2024 105 Corporate governance during the year were £0.15m (FY23: £0.15m), representing  $9\%$  (FY23:  $8\%$ ) of the audit fee. This included £0.12m (FY23: £0.11m) relating to the review of the half-year results. Our annual review of the external auditors takes into account the nature and level of all services provided.

# Review of the effectiveness and the

# independence of the external auditors

At its September meeting the Committee discussed the effectiveness of the external audit for FY23. It concluded that there had been several improvements implemented since the FY22 audit, following learnings for both PwC and the Group. It was confirmed that PwC continues to perform its audit work to a high standard, in particular as a result of its comprehension of the Company's business, control processes and the matters on which significant accounting judgements or estimates are required and its appropriate validation or challenge of management's views.

# Audit appointment and partner succession

PwC was appointed as auditor of the Group at the 2017 Annual General Meeting (AGM) following a tender process. PwC are now in their seventh year as auditor, with the external audit engagement partner, John Ellis, in his second year, having taken the lead for the FY23 audit cycle. The external audit contract will be put out to tender at least every 10 years, and the Committee considers that it would be appropriate to conduct an external audit tender during FY27 to ensure that new auditors are appointed for the FY28 audit cycle. The timing for the audit tender strikes an appropriate balance between continuity for the current audit firm and consideration of alternative firms.

The Committee and the Board will be recommending PwC's re-appointment at the 2024 AGM.

# Governance

# Audit Committee structure

The Audit Committee is comprised entirely of independent Non-executive Directors and is chaired by Shonaid Jemmett-Page, who is considered by the Board to fulfil the Code requirement of recent and relevant experience from the financial sector.

The Board considers the members of the Audit Committee to be independent and, in accordance with the Code, the Board concludes that the Committee as a whole possesses competence relevant to the Group's sector, having a range of financial and commercial experience in the industry and the commercial environment in which the Group operates. The Chair, Group Chief Executive Officer, Group Chief Financial Officer, Group Financial Controller, Group Director Internal Audit, Chief Risk Officer and representatives of the external auditor attended all Committee meetings by invitation during the year. Twice a year we also welcome the Chair of the US SSA Audit Committee to update us specifically on the internal controls and risk management across the US business.

The Committee met with PwC and the Group Director Internal Audit on two separate occasions, without Executive Directors present, to discuss the audit process and assure itself regarding resourcing, auditor independence and objectivity.

# Audit Committee effectiveness review

The evaluation of the effectiveness of the Committee was conducted alongside the Board effectiveness review. See more on pages 97 - 98. The outcome of the evaluation confirmed that the Committee continues to operate highly effectively and determined that Committee members have good oversight of, and are able to raise appropriate challenges in respect of, important financial matters, such as management's significant accounting judgements and the implementation of new accounting standards.

# Statutory audit services compliance

The company confirms that during the year under review it applied and was in compliance with the Competition and Market's Authority's Order on statutory audit and services, which relates to the frequency and governance of external audit tenders and the setting of a policy on the provision of non-audit services.

//We continue to strengthen our processes to protect tomorrow, navigating risk and security in a dynamic world. //

# Dear Shareholder,

I am pleased to present our Risk & Security Committee report for FY24, which describes our activities and areas of focus during the year.

# The Risk & Security Committee risk management responsibilities

The Risk and Security Committee has a close relationship with the Audit Committee which enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of Board oversight. The Committee provides further scrutiny and assurance to the Board that the required UK and international standards in risk management, quality, security and health and safety are achieved. This includes ensuring that the organisation fulfils its statutory requirements and duty of care. This assists the Board in setting the risk appetite and reviewing and assessing the Group's risk management systems.

# Risk profile of the Group

During the year, the Committee has focused on further developing the maturity of the Group's risk management system. This includes robust review and progress updates on various process enhancements including a deep-dive workshop on risk management and internal controls, dynamically reviewing new risks and successfully reducing the Group's risk profile. The continual cyclical review of the Group Risk Register, which is described further on pages 58 - 61 continues to be key for the Committee to undertake its duties. The Principal Risk Register contains details of the Group's principal risks, their impact on the Group and how they are managed.

# Security profile of the Group

One of our core responsibilities is to oversee the Group's physical and non-physical security systems. As our future success is dependent on our ability to exploit and operate technology at pace while still retaining the rigorous levels of security required by our customers and partners, the Committee members and I have, together with the Chief Enterprise Services Officer, Group Director Security, and Chief Risk Officer, developed a schedule of security-related agenda items, ensuring that the Committee continues to be able to oversee this key pillar. As a defence, technology and engineering Company, we are set to remain continuously aware about our risks and adapt our tools, processes, systems and people to address increasing risks arising from changing cyber, climate, technological and geopolitical instability.

I hope you find the information in this report about the Committee's work helpful and I will be pleased to answer any questions you have about it at this year's AGM.

# General Sir Gordon Messenger

Risk & Security Committee Chair

# Key Highlights FY24:

- Strengthened our risk and security teams  
- Progressed the implementation of the Three Lines model contributing to improved first line compliance and second line assurance activities  
Embedded the Security & Information and Risk & Assurance Councils as key bodies to reinforce Groupwide awareness of risk and assurance

- Progressed our transformation activities including the Global Interoperable Infrastructure (GII) Programme that strengthens the security and agility of the Group  
- Improved the consistency of enterprise risk reporting

# FY25: Priorities

- Fully embedding the Three Lines model  
Further enhancing our enterprise risk management framework  
- Driving a positive and mature risk culture to ensure we stay on top of our global dynamic view of risk  
Enhance exiting and embed new tools that help us manage our governance, risk and control activities

- Continuing to ensure that we are recruiting, building and retaining the right workforce skills and talent to drive our environment, health and safety and physical and non-physical security focus  
- Further build on foundations set to ensure our compliance to the announced changes to the FRC UK Corporate Governance Code

# Key responsibilities

The Committee's primary functions are:

- To oversee the sound operation of the Group's risk management systems  
The ongoing review of the Group's principal and emerging risks (see pages 56 - 61)  
- To oversee the Group's physical and non-physical security systems, including monitoring security exposures and security culture, and considering emerging security issues  
- To ensure that health and safety risks are being effectively managed across the Group  
- To oversee the Group's second line assurance activity over the first line compliance activity taking place across the Group's functions and businesses  
- To monitor adherence to the generic MOD compliance system  
- To review the Group's policies, processes and controls for the detection and prevention of bribery, corruption and modern slavery and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and codes of conduct

The Board assumes ultimate responsibility for the effective management of risk across the Group, determining its risk appetite and ensuring that each operating Sector implements appropriate internal controls. The Group's risk management systems are designed to appropriately manage the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and thus can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.

These systems are also designed to be sufficiently agile to respond to changes in circumstances, such as increased competition and disruptive business models, technological advancements, economic volatility and supply chain disruptions.

# Risk & Security Committee structure

All members of the Board are members of the Risk & Security Committee, which is chaired by General Sir Gordon Messenger. The Chief Enterprise Services Officer, the Group Director Security, the Chief Information Officer, the Chief Information Security Officer, the Chief Risk Officer and the Group Director - Internal Audit attend Committee meetings by invitation.

To enable the Committee to get a comprehensive understanding of how risk management processes have been implemented and to ensure that these are fully embedded within the business's day-to-day work, deep-dives are presented to the Committee by employees who have first-hand knowledge of such matters, i.e. perform the work on a daily basis.

Risk monitoring and reporting is incorporated into the management of the business through the QinetiQ Leadership Team and monthly performance reviews feed into the Group strategy at the Executive and Board level.

The risk management and risk monitoring processes are divided as following:

# Risk

# management

- Review risk management structures and reporting lines (i.e. effectiveness of control environment)  
Evaluate the effectiveness of risk reporting processes including risk control assessment  
Review the effectiveness of risk identification processes  
- Consideration of any security issues relating to the appointment of external auditors

# Risk

# monitoring

- Review of risk register and key exposures  
Monitor Health, Safety and Environmental performance  
- Scrutinise Internal Audit reports with respect to risk and security issues  
Oversee international business governance  
Oversee application of applied anti-bribery and corruption measures

# Security management

The business has progressed towards a proactive threat assessment process with effective horizon scanning for future and emerging threats to the business- a move from 'risk identification' process to one of 'risk management'. Security Incident Management has demonstrably improved through maturing of the Security and Information Governance process with a defined structure and escalation process through Sectors, Group, Security and Information Council, Security Steering Group and on to the Risk and Security Committee to ensure visibility of current and emerging risks and their management. This has been evidenced by the timely reaction and successful resolution to matters that happened over the course of the year.

The Committee is assured by the progress made by the Group in the year, although, with the ever-increasing incidence and sophistication of cyber-attacks and the consequent need for the Group to remain vigilant, the Committee expects security to remain one of its key areas of focus. As part of the drive to further control our risk exposure, we are further refining our risk appetite definitions. The Security Culture Survey, conducted by the Group Security team covering the whole Group and aimed at understanding the security maturity levels across four areas – information, physical, cyber and personnel security – proved invaluable in identifying areas for focus.

# Cyber security

Given the nature of our business, emergent security threats such as the adoption of artificial intelligence and the broader geo-political landscape, we continue to invest in our Digital and Cyber Security Programmes.

In combination with our wider education and culture initiatives, we continued to strengthen our policies, procedures and tooling to ensure we can appropriately identify, assess and manage cyber security risks. We have expanded our Cyber Security Operations team with further improvements to our protective monitoring and response capability. Our strategy remains under constant review and our refreshed Cyber and Information Security Operating Model ensures we best utilise our technical expertise and knowledge across all business areas.

The Committee continues to receive regular reports from the CIO and CISO on our cyber and information security risks, the performance of protective controls and the progress of any ongoing security improvement activities.

All employees must complete mandatory cyber, information, physical and personnel security training each year, which focuses on our policies, procedures, culture and behaviours aligned to known threats. Our Group intranet also includes a comprehensive Security Knowledge Library which is used both individually and by leaders for regular security engagements at team level. This approach substantially improved security culture and behaviour during FY24.

# Business continuity and crisis management

Our business continuity and crisis management procedures have been designed for flexible arrangements when responding to incidents and emergencies. They are scalable and can be adapted to work in a wide range of specific scenarios. We focus on resilience, informed by our risk identification and assessment rather than individual emergency scenarios. Our Crisis Management Plan sets out a decision-making model and overarching management response which supports the Leadership Team and ultimately the Board in making effective decisions during an incident. This has proved to be an effective approach with incidents managed well without causing adverse effects on the business. Supplementary training has been provided to the Leadership Team and we will continue with this approach in FY25.

# Self-certification process

An annual process of self-certification on the effectiveness of internal controls has been established and embedded across the Group. This process provides a documented and auditable trail of accountability for the operation of the system of internal controls and continues to be our preferred tool to tangibly assess the effectiveness of those controls in all functions and sectors across the Group. It is informed by a rigorous and structured self-assessment that addresses compliance with Group policies and processes, and provides a comprehensive level of assurance to be given at higher levels of management and, finally, to the Board.

Each sector and functional Chief Officer are required to make a declaration that their system of internal controls are effective, are fit for purpose and are being monitored throughout the year. Any material risks, control failures or non-compliance with the Group's risk policies, legislation and/or local delegations of authority must be highlighted as part of this process. The outcomes of the self-certification process, which is carried out at the full and half-year, is reported to the Risk and Security Committee by the Chief Risk Officer.

# Generic MOD compliance system

A key aspect of the Committee's work is the oversight of the UK Ministry of Defence's (MOD) generic compliance system. This is integral to the work of QinetiQ in its relationship with the UK Government. The system is designed to give the MOD customer confidence that QinetiQ is able to provide impartial advice during any competitive evaluation of a procurement opportunity where the Group wishes to operate on both the 'buy' and the 'supply' sides. The aim is to achieve a balance between meeting the needs of the procurement customers in the MOD (principally Defence Equipment & Support) and the need to allow QinetiQ the flexibility to commercialise research into the supply chain and pursue its planned business activities, without compromising the defence or security interests of the UK. The Board nominates two senior managers to act as Compliance Implementation Director (CID) and Compliance Audit Director (CAD).

# Anti-bribery and corruption

The Committee oversees a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption, as confirmed by the company's anti-bribery and corruption policy and the supporting local policies that apply to members of its Group. The Group also has in place a range of procedures, including regular training targeted at potentially risk-exposed roles of the employees, Group and local gifts and hospitality policies, and Group and divisional procurement, contracting and partnering practices, which are designed to prevent bribery. See more on page 69.

# Data privacy

The company respects the personal data privacy of its customers, employees and other individuals in respect of whom it and members of its Group process personal information. The Group therefore has in place policies which mandate the lawful processing and protection of such personal information in accordance with applicable laws and procedures which are designed to achieve the same. A report on GDPR compliance is presented to the Committee at each Committee meeting.

# Effectiveness review

In 2024 an effectiveness review was conducted internally. This process is described further on pages 94 - 99. The performance of the Committee was rated highly overall. The Committee agreed it would continue to focus on cyber and security risks in FY25.

# Frameworks for risk management and internal control

The Board is responsible for promoting the long term success of the company for the benefit of shareholders, as well as taking account of other stakeholders including employees and customers. To discharge this responsibility, the Board has established frameworks for risk management and internal controls using the Three Lines Model, see page 57, and reserves for itself the setting of the Group's risk appetite. In-depth monitoring of the establishment and operation of prudent and effective controls in order to assess and manage risks associated with the Group's operations is delegated to the Audit Committee, complemented by the work of the Risk & Security Committee. However, the Board retains ultimate responsibility for the Group's systems of internal controls and risk management and has reviewed their effectiveness during the year. The frameworks are regularly reviewed for prudency. They were in place throughout the financial year under review and up to the date of this report. They help ensure the Group complies with the Financial Reporting Council's (FRC) guidance on Risk Management, Internal Controls and related financial and business reporting.

After discussions with the Audit Committee and the Risk & Security Committee, the Board conducts a robust six-monthly assessment of the Group's emerging and principal risks and specifically considered the principal risks facing the company including the impacts to the Group's business model and future performance and therefore require management prioritisation and action when approving the Group business plan.

During the year, as part of the oversight process, the Board and the Risk & Security Committee received updates on risks and associated mitigating actions. Principal risks were also taken into account in the design of scenarios which are intended to stress-test the Group's five-year strategic business plan, recovery plan, climate change impacts, decisions on the return of capital to shareholders and operational resilience.

Our risk management framework is designed to consistently identify, evaluate, manage, monitor and report the principal risks to the achievement of the Group's strategic objectives and is embedded throughout the Group. It is codified through risk policy and associated processes and procedures which set out the risk appetite, requirements and controls for the Group's worldwide operations. This is further described on pages 56 - 61.

The Group maintains a manual of financial reporting policies which is compliant with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). An internal control framework is in place across the Group which covers Group financial reporting and local statutory reporting activity. The process follows a risk-based approach, with management identification of key financial reporting-related controls.

# Board oversight of risk management

The Board's delegated responsibilities regarding oversight of risk management and the approach to internal controls are set out on pages 56 - 58 and 104. There are strong working relationships between the Board Committees, which enable robust oversight of internal controls and risk management. Committees provide regular reports to the Board on their activities and escalate significant matters where appropriate. The responsibilities and activities of each Board Committee are set out in the Committee reports.

# Dear Shareholder,

As the Group Chair notes in his statement on page 2, FY24 was a year of continued strong Group performance. This was reflected in the incentive out-turns where stretch annual financial targets were exceeded on orders and cash, with profit between target and stretch performance.

# Reward decisions for FY24

The Remuneration Committee awarded base salary increases of  $3.8\%$  for the CEO and  $3.9\%$  for the former CFO effective 1 July 2023. Both salary reviews are aligned with the Rewarding for Performance guidance used for all UK employees and below the  $4.0\%$  budget for the July 2023 salary review.

Following the approval of the new Directors Remuneration Policy (the Policy) at the 2023 AGM, the unadjusted FY24 out-turn under the new Annual Bonus Plan (ABP) would have been  $87.5\%$  and  $85.0\%$  of the maximum to the CEO and former CFO respectively, reflecting strong financial performance. The payment for FY24 will be structured as  $70\%$  in cash and  $30\%$  in shares, deferred for two years.

FY24 saw the first grant under the new Long-term Performance Award (LPA). The three-year performance metrics for the grant were cumulative underlying operating profit, Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) and total revenue growth, with stretch targets aligned to our growth ambition.

Cycle 3 of the legacy Bonus Banking Plan (BBP) will be released as shares in June 2024 as the FY24 performance underpin has been achieved. The BBP is now closed and will cease to operate.

The FY21 contingent share award under the legacy Deferred Share Plan (DSP) will vest in June 2024 as the performance underpin, that FY24 profit had to exceed that delivered in FY21, has been achieved. No further awards will be made under the DSP as it was replaced by the LPA.

The FY24 CEO single figure on page 117 is higher than FY23, despite the lower FY24 annual incentive payment; this is largely due to there not being a FY20 DSP contingent share award vesting in June 2023.

The Committee agreed to exercise discretion to adjust downwards the ABP payment for FY24 in view of the tragic deaths of two of our colleagues in the German business. Although the formal investigations into this accident are ongoing, we do not believe that there was any contributory fault by the Company. Notwithstanding this, the CEO and the Committee felt it appropriate to reduce the safety out-turn of the common goals element of the ABP to demonstrate our commitment to the highest levels of safety performance. The Committee notes, however, that underlying safety performance and controls continued to improve in FY24 as a direct result of leadership actions. This downwards adjustment will be applied to the CEO, former CFO and all senior leaders in the QinetiQ Leadership Community (some 100 employees globally). Further details are provided on pages 118 and 119.

The Committee also considered carefully the potential impact on incentives of the share buyback programme which commenced in February 2024, involving the gradual purchase and deletion of some £100m of shares over 12 months. The Committee noted that no current incentive plans measure performance on a 'per share' basis and that there was no direct boost to financial performance as a result of the share buyback. The Committee therefore determined that no adjustment to incentives is necessary in relation to the share buyback.

# Leadership changes

After the end of FY24 on 16 April 2024, the Company announced that Carol Borg, Group CFO, and the Board together agreed that Carol would step down from her role. Martin Cooper has been appointed as Group CFO to succeed Carol and he is expected to join the Company no later than October 2024. The Committee determined that she should be treated as a Good Leaver for elements earned in year and also agreed the appointment terms for Martin as detailed on pages 123 and 128.

Two further critical roles were appointed to the QinetiQ Leadership Team (QLT) in April 2024 for which the Committee approved the remuneration terms - lain Stevenson to the newly created role of Chief Operating Officer and the promotion of Will Blamey as Chief Executive, UK Defence.

# Directors' Remuneration Policy

In FY23 the Committee spent a significant amount of time considering the new Policy and consulted widely with shareholders. The Committee was pleased that the new Policy received a  $84.3\%$  ‘For’ vote at the 2023 AGM and will continue to work with stakeholders to ensure that the Policy supports the delivery of our strategy and growth ambitions.

# Implementation for FY25

The ABP for FY25 is based on the same financial metrics as in FY24 (orders, profit and cash) with stretch targets set against the delivery of the Integrated Strategic Business Plan (ISBP). Financial metrics have a  $70\%$  weighting and non-financial targets have a  $30\%$  weighting based on the achievement of personal and common goals, with the focus of the latter on ESG metrics.

The Committee has reviewed the performance metrics for the FY25 LPA three-year performance period and decided that as for FY24 they will be cumulative underlying operating profit, ROCE and total revenue growth to drive consistent profit performance, robust investment selection and value creation for our customers through collaboration. The Committee is cognisant that inclusion of a relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) metric is a preference for at least one of the Company's major shareholders and it is therefore committed to keeping the use of TSR under review. However, the Committee continues to believe that relative TSR is strongly influenced by market sentiment and is also mindful of the challenge of identifying appropriate comparators for a Company such as QinetiQ that has few direct UK peers.

# Employee engagement and reward

Building on the cost-of-living measures we implemented in FY23, we have invested further in our overall employee offering in FY24. In the UK, we have implemented a reward strategy and addressed market relativity through providing additional base salary increases to employees ensuring they receive a fair market level of pay. We have also achieved Living Wage accreditation guaranteeing an above-statutory level of pay for our lowest paid UK employees. In the US we have implemented a compensation framework in support of integration. In the Australia sector we have commenced a benchmarking exercise and will be developing a sector-level reward strategy over FY25. Our Group Hardship Fund and Employee Assistance Programmes (EAP) continue to provide additional support to our employees who are experiencing challenging personal circumstances.

QinetiQ's employees are key to the delivery of our ambitious growth strategy. Our employees have been outstanding this year, demonstrating extraordinary focus, collaboration and drive to continue to deliver to our customers.

The CEO and the Chief People Officer have held regular discussions with our Global Employee Voice on reward matters. The social section on page 48 details our employee engagement activity.

I met with the Chair and other representatives of the Global Employee Voice during the year which provided a really insightful opportunity to discuss the evolving global economic situation, the working environment post COVID and how we are focused on enhancing the performance culture within the business.

The Company operates an All Employee Incentive Scheme (AEIS) whereby every eligible employee can earn a payment if the Company achieves a level of operating profit within a predetermined range from target to stretch. FY24 performance was just below the stretch profit target resulting in a payment for the Company element of the AEIS of £1,138.

In addition, high-performing employees can earn up to an additional  $5\%$  of salary based on personal performance rating.

The AEIS is a key element of the Company's Rewarding for Performance framework and aligns employees and shareholder interests by incentivising and rewarding profitable growth. The Company will operate the AEIS again for FY25. Looking forward, the Company will continue to invest in our global reward and benefits strategy and our employee offering.

# Conclusion

Supporting leadership to drive Company performance and strategy by implementing the new Policy were the primary areas of focus of the Remuneration Committee in FY24. The Committee believes the evolution of the QLT at the beginning of FY25 sets the Company up for success as it continues to scale and grow globally. We also remain mindful of the global competitive environment and the increasing levels of responsibility.

The Company performed well in FY24 with continued strong Group performance. To achieve the next phase of profitable growth we need simple stretching incentives which offer motivating opportunities for leadership aligned to the five-year strategy with consistent operational performance.

I am very grateful for the time shareholders have given us this year and I hope that we can rely on your vote in support of the Directors' Remuneration Report at the AGM on 18 July 2024.

I am pleased Dina Knight joined the Committee in March 2024 and it is our intention that she will take over the Chair role in 12 months time.

I would welcome comments and questions from shareholders in relation to this Directors' Remuneration Report and I can be contacted through companysecretariat@qinetiq.com.

# Timing

To create strong alignment between executive remuneration and the long-term interests of our shareholders, the ABP is paid in part in deferred shares vesting two years after the award was earned. The LPA has a three-year performance period, after which any vested shares must be retained by the Executive for a further two years.

# Directors' Remuneration Policy Q&A

# What are the principles of QinetiQ's Directors' Remuneration Policy?

The principles of the Policy are:

- A clear approach with alignment to market practice and separation between annual and long-term incentives;  
- To drive sustainable annual performance, supporting our ambitious growth strategy and long-term value creation;  
Balance between supporting organic and inorganic growth;  
- Drive collaboration across our teams; and
- Retain, attract and incentivise top talent.

# How does the Policy align executive pay with the interests of shareholders?

QinetiQ's annual incentive scheme and long-term share plan deliver shares which must be retained after any award is paid or vests. In our ABP,  $30\%$  of the award is deferred and held as shares and is therefore subject to share price exposure. In our LPA there is a three-year performance period before any shares vest and then a further two-year holding period.

In addition, the Executive Directors are required to build and hold a significant shareholding in the Company of  $300\%$  of salary for the CEO and  $200\%$  for other Executive Directors.

# How does your Policy reward the implementation of Company strategy?

Our strategy, as detailed in our five-year Integrated Strategic Business Plan (ISBP), aims to deliver sustainable and long-term growth in our business and to increase value to our shareholders.

The Policy focuses on the achievement of stretching but sustainable annual and three-year financial performance targets aligned to the ISBP, balanced with common goals and personal objectives, to provide strategic alignment and support the growth ambition of the Company.

# Q How does the Policy drive corporate culture?

Our annual bonus scheme includes a  $30\%$  weighting towards non-financial metrics including common goals (which include ESG metrics) and personal objectives. Common goals are based on ESG targets for employee engagement and inclusion, progress towards the Net-Zero target and the overall safety maturity of the Company.

The personal objectives measure the 'what' and the 'how' to ensure that key personal deliverables are achieved through collegiate and collaborative behaviours.

# How is ESG reflected within the bonus plans?

ESG is measured through metrics such as route to Net-Zero, employee engagement and diversity and inclusion interventions. These have a  $17.5\%$  weighting in the current annual incentive plan, which we anticipate will continue for the ABP in FY25 and thereafter. At this current point in the Company's journey towards Net-Zero and other core ESG milestones, the Committee considers it better to focus on annual incremental performance to deliver long-term goals.

# How do you avoid rewarding for failure?

In line with best practice, Executive Directors' contractual notice periods are 12 months with termination payments normally limited to salary, benefits and pension with a duty to mitigate loss if they are terminated by the Company.

Incentives have stretching performance targets to ensure that any payments are justified with the Remuneration Committee having discretion to adjust the formulaic out-turn to ensure that rewards are appropriate. In addition, bonus deferral, holding periods and shareholding requirements ensure a focus on sustainable share price performance.

# How have you supported employees in FY24

Building on the cost-of-living measures we implemented in FY23, we have invested further in our overall employee offering in FY24. In the UK, in response to the continued high levels of inflation we have provided additional base salary increases to ensure our employees receive a fair market level of pay. We have also achieved Living Wage accreditation guaranteeing an above-statutory level of pay for our lowest paid UK employees and subcontractors and are working towards equivalent accreditation in other geographies (e.g. Canada). In the US we have concluded a benchmarking exercise helping us to better understand our market position and in the Australia sector we have commenced a benchmarking exercise and will be developing a sector-level reward strategy over FY25. Our Group Hardship Fund and Employee Assistance Programmes (EAP) continue to provide additional support to our employees who are experiencing challenging personal circumstances.

# How do you focus on employee engagement?

Our employees share in the Company's success following the introduction of the AEIS in FY19 which pays up to £1,250 to all eligible employees on the basis of the Company's annual operating profit performance. The AEIS is important as a performance driver, to support collaboration and to share the success we create for shareholders.

Our Global Employee Voice (GEV), representing our global employees, is deeply engaged across the Company. We listen to the views and level of engagement of our people through a quarterly survey using a market-leading dynamic tool (Peakon).

# Summary Directors' Remuneration Policy

# The Directors' Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders at the AGM on 20 July 2023.

The full Policy is provided in the Corporate Governance section on the Company's website, and it will remain in effect until the 2026 AGM. When considering the review of the Policy, the Committee was mindful of UK Corporate Governance Code provisions which state that the Committee should address the issues as follows:

- Clarity is achieved by the simplification of the incentives and the better separation between the annual and long-term plans in the Policy

- Simplicity is delivered by a simple approach to incentives in the Policy, particularly the ABP  
- Risk continues to be managed through the operation of a broad suite of performance measures and targets, the use of deferral, holding periods and malus and clawback provisions, and the close interaction with the Audit and Risk & Security Committees  
- Predictability is achieved by setting clear performance targets and outcomes for threshold, target and stretch levels of performance, with a close link to Company strategy

- Proportionality is delivered through performance conditions, both financial and non-financial, with the clear link to strategy. The Committee has the discretion to override formulaic outturns to ensure that they are appropriate and reflect overall performance
- Alignment to culture is supported by performance measures which are consistent with the Company's purpose, values and strategy

A summary of the Policy is set out below:  

<table><tr><td>Element</td><td>Purpose and link to strategy</td><td>Operation and performance measures</td><td>Maximum opportunity</td></tr><tr><td>Base salary</td><td>To attract and retain the talent needed to lead our business.</td><td>An Executive Director&#x27;s base salary is set on appointment and reviewed annually or when there is a change in position or responsibility. 
When determining an appropriate level of salary, the Committee considers: 
- general salary rises to employees; 
- remuneration practices within the Group; 
- any change in scope, role and responsibilities; 
- the general performance of the Group; 
- the experience of the relevant Director; 
- the economic environment; and 
- pay levels for similar roles among appropriate comparators. 
Individuals who are recruited or promoted to the Board may, on occasion, have their salaries set below the targeted policy level until they become established in their role. In such cases subsequent increases in salary may be higher than the general rises for employees until the target positioning is achieved.</td><td>Typically, the base salaries of Executive Directors in post at the start of the Policy period and who remain in the same role throughout will be increased by a similar percentage to the average annual percentage increase in salaries of all other employees in the Group. 
The exceptions to this rule may be where: 
- an individual is below market-level and a decision is taken to increase base pay to reflect proven competence in the role; or 
- there is a material increase in scope or responsibility to the Executive Director&#x27;s role. 
The Committee ensures that maximum salary levels are positioned in line with companies of a similar size to QinetiQ and validated against other companies in the industry, so that they are competitive against the market.</td></tr><tr><td>Pension allowance</td><td>To ensure that Executive Directors&#x27; total remuneration remains attractive and competitive.</td><td>The Company provides a pension contribution allowance in line with practice relative to its comparators to enable the Company to recruit and retain Executive Directors with the experience and expertise to deliver the Group&#x27;s strategy.</td><td>The maximum policy pension allowance is aligned with the Company pension contribution paid to the majority of UK pension scheme members (which is currently 10.5% of salary).</td></tr><tr><td>Benefits</td><td>To ensure that Executive Directors&#x27; total remuneration remains attractive and competitive.</td><td>Benefits include car allowance, health insurance, life assurance, income protection, expenses incurred which HMRC may deem taxable and membership of the Group&#x27;s employee Share Incentive Plan which is open to all UK employees.</td><td>Benefit values can vary year-on-year depending on premiums and the maximum is the cost of providing the relevant benefits.</td></tr></table>

# Annual Bonus Plan (audited)

The ABP is an annual incentive plan with a one-year performance measurement period, with any award paid partly in deferred shares. After the end of the first year,  $70\%$  of the award is paid as a cash bonus. The remaining  $30\%$  is made as a deferred share award that must be held for two years and is subject to continued employment. Malus and clawback apply for up to three years from the payment date.

# Deferred Share Plan (audited)

The FY21 legacy DSP award achieved the performance underpin based on FY24 profit exceeding that in FY21 (£150.0m) and, therefore, the shares ceased to be contingent, will vest in June 2024 and are disclosed in the single figure for FY24. The  $100\%$  vesting refers to the shares which have passed the underpin of those initially granted based on FY21 performance, which was  $100\%$  of the maximum available. The share value used is the 30-day average to 31 March 2024 (364.9p) and the estimated value includes £51,902 as dividend equivalent payments.

# Annual Report on Remuneration continued

Annual Bonus Plan (audited)

For the year ended 31 March 2024 achievement of on-target performance provides a payment equal to  $100\%$  of base salary, rising on a linear scale to  $200\%$  of base salary for achievement of stretch performance.

The scheme begins to pay out once threshold performance measures have been achieved. For the year ended 31 March 2024, the CEO and CFO were measured against the targets as shown in the chart to the right. The target payment was  $50\%$  of maximum for financial and non-financial objectives.

When setting performance targets the Remuneration Committee takes into account the budget and the Company's strategy set in relation to the ISBP, shareholder expectations and the external environment.

The aim is to set stretching targets which incentivise the Executive Directors to deliver annual results which will exceed the expectations of investors, but which are also sustainable and do not create undue profit risk. Financial performance measures exclude the contribution from businesses acquired in the year.

2 Based on a recommendation by the CEO, the Committee agreed to exercise discretion to adjust downwards the ABP payment for FY24 in view of the tragic accident when two of our colleagues lost their lives in the German business. This downwards adjustment reduced the actual FY24 ABP payment by £25,844 and £16,791 for the CEO and former CFO respectively, resulting in actual payments of CEO £1,180,186 (85.6% of the maximum) and former CFO £744,423 (83.1% of the maximum).  
3 The FY24 ABP payment will be made  $70\%$  in cash in June 2024 and  $30\%$  will be awarded as deferred shares in June 2024 which must be held for two years.

# How the legacy BBP operated

- The Plan operated on a fixed three-year performance cycle with a four-year vesting cycle. FY24 represents Year 4 of Cycle 3.  
- Performance targets were set at the beginning of each Plan year.  
- At the end of each of the first three Plan years the performance against targets was assessed and the level of the incentive earned is determined and paid into the Plan account.  
Each year  $50 \%$ of the account balance was subject to forfeiture based on the achievement of a profit underpin target.  
- At the end of each of the first three Plan years,  $50\%$  of the account balance was paid in cash and the balance retained and held in the Plan as notional shares.  
- At the end of Year 4 for Cycle 3, any remaining balance in the Plan account is paid out in shares and a cash dividend equivalent is paid.

# Forfeiture

For BBP Cycle 3 the CEO and CFO retained notional shares in their Plan accounts of which  $50\%$  were subject to forfeiture. Forfeiture would have been enacted if Group underlying operating profit was less than the level determined by the Remuneration Committee at the start of the year of  $\pounds 173\text{m}$  for FY24. Group underlying operating profit for FY24 was  $\pounds 215.2\text{m}$  therefore no notional shares were forfeited and the closing balance will be paid out in shares following the end of FY24.

# Termination of the BBP

Following the introduction of the ABP, the BBP has been terminated and no investment made in FY24. The notional shares on account as at the end of Plan Year 3 (as identified below) will be delivered to the CEO and former CFO as actual shares with a dividend equivalent payment in June 2024.

# Legacy Deferred Share Plan (DSP) (audited)

# Termination of the DSP

Further to shareholder approval of the new Directors' Remuneration Policy at the 2023 AGM, the DSP was terminated and no award was made in relation to FY24 performance. The FY23 DSP award was  $100.0\%$  of the maximum available (125% of salary for Executive Directors); it has been deferred for three years and remains subject to a performance underpin; any vested shares are then subject to a further two-year holding period.

Details of the final FY23 DSP award, which was made on 20 June 2023, were provided in the FY23 Report. Subsisting DSP awards as identified on page 123 will continue to be available to vest on the basis of the relevant performance underpin.

The FY21 DSP award achieved the performance underpin based on the FY24 profit exceeded that in FY21 (£150.0m) and, therefore, the shares ceased to be contingent and will be released on 25 June 2024. Had the FY24 profit not been greater than FY21,  $50\%$  of the DSP award would have lapsed. The net shares vesting from the FY21 DSP must be retained for a further two years. The value of this award is shown in the single figure table for the CEO (the former CFO did not receive an FY21 DSP award). The value of the 232,746 shares vesting is £849,290 based on the 30-day average to 31 March 2024 (364.9p). The estimated value includes £51,902 as dividend equivalent payments based on an aggregate dividend of 22.3p paid in FY22 to FY24 and a share price appreciation between grant and vesting of £100,081.

# Long-term Performance Award (LPA) (audited)

# Performance targets for FY24

The Committee set performance measures and targets for the Long-term Performance Award with a clear link to Company strategy and incentivising growth:

Earnings: organic underlying operating profit on a three-year cumulative basis (35% weighting)

- Designed to deliver consistent operational performance over the longer term  
- Understood, relevant and actionable for QinetiQ senior leaders

- Returns: ROCE (35% weighting)

Average EBITA for the three-year period divided by average capital employed  
- Designed to drive robust investment selection and delivery

- Value creation through collaboration: total revenue growth (30% weighting)  
- Designed to drive value creation through collaboration and market leverage

For the FY24 LPA the Committee agreed the following targets aligned with our growth ambition (20% of each element vests at Threshold).

Cumulative earnings targets are deemed commercially sensitive at this time but are consistent with our growth ambition at 11-12% margin.

ROCE

Threshold  $15.0\%$

Threshold £1.9bn

Stretch 20.0%

Stretch £2.7bn.

The FY24 Target level of performance is not calculated on a linear basis and the Target is deemed commercially sensitive at this time as it is aligned to confidential Group strategy.

FY24 LPA conditional share awards were granted based on a maximum of  $250.0\%$  of base salary at a share price of 321.3p determined over a five-day period prior to grant. The three-year performance period for the FY24 award ends on 31 March 2026. Any shares which vest must then be held for a further two years.

Statement of Directors' shareholding and share interests.

In relation to the shareholding requirement adopted on 1 April 2017 the Company requires Executive Directors to hold shares (beneficially owned) equivalent to  $300\%$  (CEO) and  $200\%$  (CFO) of base salary. Executive Directors have five years from the adoption of the guideline to achieve the required level through, at a minimum, retaining  $50\%$  of the after-tax shares vesting from Company incentive plans.

The CEO has achieved his shareholding requirement and currently holds shares equivalent to  $335\%$  of base salary using a share price of 354.7p (three-month average to 31 March 2024). On 27 July 2023 the CEO sold 300,000 QinetiQ shares which had vested as part of his participation in Company share incentive plans. After the share sale the CEO remained compliant with his shareholding requirement.

The former CFO was appointed during 2021 and had not achieved the minimum shareholding requirement at year-end, with a holding of shares equivalent to  $0\%$  of base salary. The post-cessation shareholding requirement will be applied to shares vesting after the termination of her employment as per Policy.

The Remuneration Committee continues to monitor compliance with the shareholding requirement.

Shares beneficially owned comprise shares purchased under the Share Incentive Plan (SIP) and shares owned by the Director and any connected persons. SIP matching shares are identified as shares not subject to performance conditions. On 9 April 2024 Steve Wadey purchased 56 shares, then on 9 May 2024 he purchased a further 56 shares, through his participation in the SIP. Shares subject to performance conditions comprise awards made under the Deferred Share Plan and Long term Performance Award which remain contingent subject to the relevant performance conditions as detailed on page 123.

Carol Borg's share interests were adjusted on leaving the Company as detailed on page 123.

There have been no other changes to the shares shown above between 31 March 2024 and 23 May 2024. Notional shares held by the CEO and former CFO in the BBP Cycle 3 do not appear in the table above as they are not actual shares at 23 May 2024. However, it is anticipated that the BBP Cycle 3 shares will vest as actual shares in June 2024.

1 The FY23 DSP contingent share award granted on 20 June 2023 at a share price of 330.2p (30-day average to 31 March 2023) is calculated on awards of  $100.0\%$  of the maximum  $(125.0\%)$  of salary) with a face value of £830,268 and £539,071 for the CEO and former CFO respectively. If the FY23 Group underlying organic profit (£169.5m) is not achieved in FY26, a minimum of  $50\%$  of the award will lapse.  
2 The FY24 LPA conditional shares granted on 28 September 2023 at a share price of 321.3p (5-day average prior to grant) are calculated on the basis of  $250.0\%$  of salary with a face value of  $\mathbb{E}1,675,104$  and  $\mathbb{E}1,087,565$  for the CEO and former CFO respectively. The performance period for the FY24 LPA ends on 31 March 2026 based on the achievement of earnings, ROCE and revenue targets. Any shares which vest must be retained for a further two years.

As part of the package approved by the Remuneration Committee for Carol Borg at recruitment, it was agreed that she would receive a share award in part compensation for share awards which were forfeited on resigning from her former employer. On 5 January 2022 Carol was granted an award over 193,199 shares which will vest in three years. The QinetiQ share price used was the average closing price over the 30 days prior to the award with a value at grant of £500,000. As part of her termination arrangements, these shares will vest in full on the normal vesting date.

Carol Borg's FY22 and FY23 DSP awards will be reduced for time pro-rating and remain subject to the relevant performance underpin being met. Any DSP shares which vest will remain subject to a two-year holding period. Her FY24 LPA award lapsed on leaving on 15 April 2024.

The FY24 ABP payment will be paid  $30\%$  in shares deferred for two years. It is anticipated that these shares will be awarded in June 2024.

There have been no other changes to the interests shown above between 31 March 2024 and 23 May 2024.

<table><tr><td>Financial Year ended 31 March</td><td>CEO</td><td>Salary/fees</td><td>Single figure</td><td>Annual bonus (% of maximum)</td><td>Long-term incentives(% of maximum vesting)</td></tr><tr><td>FY24</td><td>Steve Wadey</td><td>689,160</td><td>2,928,669</td><td>85.6%</td><td>100.0%</td></tr><tr><td>FY23</td><td>Steve Wadey</td><td>664,126</td><td>2,164,306</td><td>98.2%</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>FY22</td><td>Steve Wadey</td><td>639,121</td><td>2,477,069</td><td>71.4%</td><td>100.0%</td></tr><tr><td>FY21</td><td>Steve Wadey</td><td>511,550</td><td>2,695,414</td><td>95.7%</td><td>100.0%</td></tr><tr><td>FY20</td><td>Steve Wadey</td><td>610,357</td><td>1,978,247</td><td>87.5%</td><td>38.4%</td></tr><tr><td>FY19</td><td>Steve Wadey</td><td>596,422</td><td>2,339,474</td><td>94.4%</td><td>31.7%</td></tr><tr><td>FY18</td><td>Steve Wadey</td><td>582,167</td><td>1,522,460</td><td>66.7%</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>FY17 (restated)</td><td>Steve Wadey</td><td>568,166</td><td>1,829,470</td><td>86.4%</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>FY16</td><td>Steve Wadey</td><td>520,219</td><td>1,654,546</td><td>85.4%</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>FY16</td><td>David Mellors</td><td>455,885</td><td>1,423,382</td><td>82.9%</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>FY15</td><td>David Mellors</td><td>501,227</td><td>1,725,960</td><td>88.6%</td><td>13.9%</td></tr><tr><td>FY15</td><td>Leo Quinn</td><td>469,776</td><td>673,979</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr></table>

# CEO pay ratio

The calculation below is based on the FY24 single figure for the CEO of £2,928,669 and similar calculations for the UK workforce (i.e. 'Option A' as defined by the Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018). The Remuneration Committee chose Option A as it is the approach generally favoured by investors and GC100. The calculations for the UK workforce were performed as at 31 March 2024.

# Total remuneration

Ratio of the CEO's to the pay of UK employees

<table><tr><td>Year</td><td>25th percentile</td><td>Median</td><td>75th percentile</td></tr><tr><td>FY24</td><td>67: 1</td><td>50: 1</td><td>38: 1</td></tr><tr><td>FY23</td><td>53: 1</td><td>40: 1</td><td>31: 1</td></tr><tr><td>FY22</td><td>67: 1</td><td>49: 1</td><td>37: 1</td></tr><tr><td>FY21</td><td>70: 1</td><td>52: 1</td><td>39: 1</td></tr><tr><td>FY20</td><td>56: 1</td><td>41: 1</td><td>31: 1</td></tr></table>

The CEO pay ratios have increased between FY23 and FY24 as a result of the lower CEO single figure for FY23 due to no DSP award vesting in the year. The Company believes that the median pay ratio for FY24 is consistent with the pay, reward and progression policies for the UK employees as the approach for all QinetiQ employees is monitored and reported to the Remuneration Committee on an annual basis.

Year-on-year movements in the CEO pay ratio are likely to be volatile due to the wide range of incentive outcomes for the CEO single figure, but the Remuneration Committee does note the ratio and will monitor long-term trends.

# Total pay of UK employees

<table><tr><td></td><td>25th percentile</td><td>Median</td><td>75th percentile</td></tr><tr><td>Total pay and benefits</td><td>£43,906</td><td>£58,329</td><td>£76,690</td></tr><tr><td>Salary component1</td><td>£39,711</td><td>£39,922</td><td>£70,153</td></tr></table>

1 The base salary data is impacted by the fact that the employee identified at the Median on a total pay basis had a significant overtime payment.

The Remuneration Committee welcomes the opportunity to provide this information to shareholders. The Company aims to reward all employees fairly for the success and growth they create.

# Remuneration policy for all employees

All employees of QinetiQ are entitled to base salary, benefits and pension. UK and Australia-based employees are entitled to participate in the QinetiQ Share Incentive Plan. The maximum incentive opportunity available is based on the seniority and responsibility of the role. Participation in the LPA is available to Executive Directors, senior leaders and selected employees throughout the organisation.

The All Employee Incentive Scheme (AEIS) provides every eligible employee the opportunity to earn a cash bonus based on Company and personal performance. For FY24 the Company element of the AEIS was paid at an above target level of £1,138 as the profit target was exceeded. The AEIS will be operated again in FY25 and thereafter.

The Committee reviews (but does not decide) the general reward policy for all employees and any significant changes proposed. Alignment with the workforce is delivered through the Rewarding for Performance framework, including a transparent and consistent approach to the annual salary review, the AEIS to drive Company and personal performance, recognition schemes and market competitive benefits in our countries. For FY24 the Company has agreed further significant investment in the employee offering across the Group including, in the UK, addressing market relativity through providing additional base salary increases to employees ensuring they receive a fair market level of pay.

The Group Chair, the Remuneration Committee Chair, the CEO and Chief People Officer have met with the Global Employee Voice several times during FY24. Amongst other things, these meetings have discussed how executive remuneration is aligned to the broader employee offering in support of Group strategy.

1 Michael Harper - Resigned 20 July 2023  
2 Fees include Committee Chair fees  
3 Dina Knight and Ross McEwan - Appointed 1 March 2024  
4 Lawrence Prior III - Resigned 16 March 2024

Benefits include travel and subsistence expenses (grossed-up for tax) incurred in relation to the execution of their duties with the Company that are considered by HMRC to be taxable.

Lawrence Prior is a US resident and received a  $4,000 fee for attending UK meetings until his resignation; as an Australian resident Ross McEwan receives a UK meeting fee of AU$ 8,000. UK-based Non-executive Directors are entitled to receive a £2,500 fee for attending US meetings. The fees for Michael Harper include £12,000 as Senior Independent Director until his date of resignation, when Steve Mogford was elected to this role and received this fee. For Lawrence Prior and Ross McEwan, a payment of £10,000 was paid as senior US and Australia resident Non-executive Director respectively.

# Percentage change in Directors' remuneration

The following table compares the percentage change in the Director's salary/fees, bonus and benefits to the average percentage change in salary, bonus and benefits for a comparison group (4,371 employees) in the UK business in service between 1 April 2023 and 31 March 2024. The analysis only includes Directors who served for FY24 and includes the temporary salary/fee sacrifice in FY21.

UK employees were chosen to avoid the impact of exchange rate movements over the year. QinetiQ Group plc has no employees so QinetiQ Group Ltd employees were used.

The reduction in salary and fees which the Board implemented as a waiver for six months in FY21 impacted the analysis above, as did the reduced travel and physical meeting attendance. The benefits paid to Non-executive Directors are largely travel and subsistence expenses incurred in relation to the execution of their duties with the Company that are considered by HMRC to be taxable.

# Relative importance of spend on pay

The graph below shows actual spend on all employee remuneration, shareholder dividends and buy-backs and any other significant use of profit and cash within the previous two financial years.

# Total employee remuneration

The increase in employee remuneration is due to a full year of the Avantus and Air Affairs acquisitions and the FY24 UK reward interventions.

# Gender related pay

QinetiQ is subject to gender pay reporting for UK employees and a copy of our latest report is available on the Company's website.

# Service contracts/letters of appointment

The Company's policy is that Executive Directors have rolling contracts which are terminable by either party giving 12 months' notice. The Group Chairman and the Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts but are appointed under letters of appointment. All service contracts and letters of appointment are available for viewing at the Company's registered office and at the AGM.

Non-executive Directors typically serve two three-year terms but may be invited by the Board to serve for an additional period (see table in the Nominations Committee report on page 92).

<table><tr><td>Director</td><td>Date appointed</td><td>Arrangement</td><td>Notice period</td></tr><tr><td>Steve Wadey</td><td>27 April 2015</td><td>Service contract</td><td>12 months</td></tr><tr><td>Carol Borg</td><td>11 October 2021</td><td>Service contract</td><td>12 months</td></tr><tr><td>Shonaid Jemmett-Page</td><td>19 May 2020</td><td>Initial term of three years from date of appointment, subject to annual reappointment at the AGM.</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Neil Johnson</td><td>02 April 2019</td><td>Initial term of three years from date of appointment, subject to annual reappointment at the AGM.</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Dina Knight</td><td>01 March 2024</td><td>Initial term of three years from date of appointment, subject to annual reappointment at the AGM.</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Ross McEwan</td><td>01 March 2024</td><td>Initial term of three years from date of appointment, subject to annual reappointment at the AGM.</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>General Sir Gordon Messenger</td><td>12 October 2020</td><td>Initial term of three years from date of appointment, subject to annual reappointment at the AGM.</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Steve Mogford</td><td>01 August 2022</td><td>Initial term of three years from date of appointment, subject to annual reappointment at the AGM.</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Susan Searle</td><td>14 March 2014</td><td>Initial term of three years from date of appointment, subject to annual reappointment at the AGM.</td><td>-</td></tr></table>

# Implementation of Policy for the year ended 31 March 2024

# Fees

Non-executive Directors' fees were reviewed effective 1 July 2023 were set as follows:

- Basic fee £60,000 (was £55,000)  
Committee Chair fee £14,000 (was £12,000)  
Senior Independent Director fee £12,000 (was £10,000)

The fee increase was based on a NED fee benchmarking report provided by Mercer, and having considered the workload and contribution of the NEDs, the increase in base fee is  $9.1\%$ , which is the first increase in two years since July 2021 and is less than the increases applied to the UK workforce over FY23 and FY24.

The Non-executive Group Chair receives a fee of £273,000 per annum which was increased by  $4.0\%$  effective 1 July 2023; the increase aligned to that applied to the UK workforce over FY24.

Fees are reviewed in line with Policy.

Executive Directors are permitted to accept one external Non-executive Director position with the Board's approval. Any fees received in respect of these appointments may be retained by the Executive Director. The CEO and CFO do not hold any Non-executive Directorships in other companies.

# Implementation of Policy for the year ending 31 March 2025

At the 15 May 2024 meeting of the Remuneration Committee, a base salary increase of  $4.5\%$  (to £727,000p.a.) was approved for the CEO, effective 1 July 2024. The CEO's salary review is below the Rewarding for Performance guidance used for all UK employees which included a  $5.0\%$  budget for the July 2024 salary review plus  $0.5\%$  for in-year salary progression.

# New CFO Terms of Appointment

On joining QinetiQ as Group CFO, Martin Cooper will receive:

- A base salary of £455,000 p.a. subject to review in July 2025, benefits and pension allowance aligned to Policy.  
- An ABP maximum annual payment of  $200\%$  of salary and an LPA maximum annual grant of  $250\%$  of salary, as per Policy.  
- As part compensation for share awards lost on resignation from his former employer, some performance dependent and others lost on cessation of employment, two awards of restricted stock will be granted as soon as practicable after joining with a total value of £900,000. Tranche 1 with a value of £550,000 will vest in March 2026; Tranche 2 with a value of £350,000 will vest in March 2027. Both vesting dates are a one year extension on the awards surrendered and conditional on continued employment.  
- In addition and in part compensation for the value of other awards forfeited at his current employer, his FY25 LPA will not be pro-rated to take account of the months between the grant of the FY25 awards to other employees and his start date.

# Incentives for Executives

The table below shows the measures and relative weighting for the Annual Bonus Plan for the CEO and incoming CFO:

<table><tr><td>Annual Bonus Plan</td><td>Performance measure (excluding FY25 acquisitions)</td><td>Relative weighting(%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Target performance 100% of base salary</td><td>Orders</td><td>15.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Underlying operating profit</td><td>30.0%</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Stretch performance 200% of base salary</td><td>Underlying net cash flow from operations</td><td>25.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Common, ESG and Personal Goals</td><td>30.0%</td></tr></table>

For FY25 the Remuneration Committee agreed to re-balance the annual incentive weightings by reducing the orders metric to  $15\%$  (FY24  $20\%$ ) and increasing the cash metric to  $25\%$  (FY24  $20\%$ ); profit remains at  $30\%$  weighting. The revised financial weightings reflect the need to drive profitable growth and strong cash management. The focus on ESG goals as part of the non-financial metrics continues for FY25 with a  $17.5\%$  weighting.

For FY25, the Remuneration Committee set the target level of performance at  $50\%$  of stretch for the financial measures, common and personal goals. Details of specific performance targets for the ABP have not been provided as they are deemed commercially sensitive. The targets will be disclosed retrospectively in next year's Annual Report on Remuneration.

For FY25 the Committee has set performance measures and targets for the LPA with a clear link to Company strategy and incentivising growth:

- Earnings: organic underlying operating profit on a three-year cumulative basis (35% weighting)

- Designed to deliver consistent operational performance over the longer term  
- Understood, relevant and actionable for QinetiQ senior leaders

- Returns: ROCE (35% weighting)

Average EBITA for the three-year period divided by average capital employed  
- Designed to drive robust investment selection and delivery

- Value creation through collaboration: total revenue growth (30% weighting)  
- Designed to drive value creation through collaboration and market leverage

For the FY25 LPA the Committee agreed the following targets aligned with our growth ambition (20% of each element vests at Threshold). Cumulative earnings targets are deemed commercially sensitive at this time but are consistent with our growth ambition at 11-12% margin.

ROCE

Threshold 15.0%

Stretch  $20.0\%$ .

FY27 Total revenue

Threshold £2.0bn

Stretch £3.0bn.

# Remuneration Committee effectiveness review

A performance evaluation of the Committee is conducted annually. This process is described further on page 97.

# Remuneration consultants

In FY23 the Committee appointed Mercer as independent adviser to the Committee to provide advice on market practice, corporate governance and investors' views. Mercer were selected by the Committee after providing ad-hoc advice in support of the design of the new Directors' Remuneration Policy and based on members' prior experience of working with them.

Fees paid to Mercer during the year for services provided were £80,165 calculated on a time-spent basis at pre-agreed rates. Mercer provides the Company with consulting advice on conditions for employees in the US and manages the UK DC pension fund. The Committee reviews the nature of the advice received from Mercer on an annual basis to satisfy itself that the advice it receives is independent and objective.

# Research and development

One of the Group's distinct business capabilities is the provision of funded research and development (R&D) to customers. The Group also invests in the commercialisation of promising technologies across all areas of business.

In the financial year, the Group recorded £328.2m (FY23: £313.8m) of total R&D-related expenditure, of which £315.4m (FY23: £299.2m) was customer-funded work and £12.8m (FY23: £14.6m) was internally funded. Additionally, £4.0m (FY23: £2.7m) of late-stage development costs were capitalised and £3.3m (FY23: £3.5m) of capitalised development costs were amortised in the year.

# Political donations

QinetiQ's policy is that it does not make what are commonly regarded as donations to any political party. QinetiQ does undertake legitimate interactions with MPs and others in the political world, to make them aware of key industry issues and matters that affect QinetiQ, and to make an important contribution to their understanding of QinetiQ, the markets in which it operates and the work of their constituents.

The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive the Company's Reports and Accounts, to attend and speak at general meetings of the Company, to exercise voting rights in person or by appointing a proxy, and to receive a dividend where declared or paid out of profits available for that purpose.

# Rights of special shareholder

The Special Share is held by HM Government through the Secretary of State for Defence (the Special Shareholder) and it may only be held by and transferred to HM Government. It confers certain rights to protect UK defence and security interests. These include:

- The promotion and reinforcement of the MOD compliance principles which require QinetiQ to be an impartial, ethical and responsible contractor by avoiding conflicts of interest in its dealings with the MOD  
- The protection of defined strategic assets of the Group, such as certain testing facilities, by providing the Special Shareholder with an option to purchase those assets in certain circumstances  
- The right to require certain persons with a material interest in QinetiQ to dispose of some or all of their ordinary shares on the grounds of national security or conflict of interest  
- A provision whereby at least the Non-executive Chairman or Chief Executive Officer must be a British citizen

The Special Share carries no financial and economic value and the Special Shareholder is not entitled to vote at a general meeting of the Company. At any time the Special Shareholder may require QinetiQ to redeem the share at par and, if wound up, the Special Shareholder would be entitled to be repaid at its nominal value before other shareholders. Any variation of the rights attached to the Special Share requires the written approval of the MOD. Further details can be found in note 29 on page 176.

The indemnity would be provided out of the Scheme assets.

# Change of control - significant agreements

The following significant agreements contain provisions entitling the counterparties to require prior approval, exercise termination, alteration or other similar rights in the event of a change of control of the Company, or if the Company ceases to be a UK company:

- The Combined Aerial Target Service contract is a 20-year contract awarded to QinetiQ Target Services Limited by the MOD on 14 December 2006. The terms of this contract require the Company to remain a UK company which is incorporated under the laws of any part of the UK, or an overseas company registered in the UK, and that at least  $50\%$  of the Board of Directors are UK nationals. The terms also contain change of control conditions and restricted share transfer conditions which require prior approval from HM Government if there is a material change in the ownership of the Company's share capital, unless the change relates to shares listed on a regulated market; 'material' is defined as being  $10\%$  or more of the share capital. In addition, there are restrictions on transfers of shares to persons from countries appearing on the restricted list as issued by HM Government.

- The Long Term Partnering Agreement (LTPA) is a 25-year contract, which QinetiQ Limited signed on 28 February 2003, to provide test, evaluation and training services to the MOD. This contract contains conditions under which the prior approval of HM Government is required if the contractor, QinetiQ Limited, ceases to be a subsidiary of the QinetiQ Group, except where such change in control is permitted under the Shareholders Agreement to which the MOD is a party.

- The Maritime Strategic Capabilities Agreement Future Arrangement contract is a 10-year contract awarded by the MOD which came into effect on 1 April 2023. The contract terms include a provision requiring that any change of control of QinetiQ Limited requires prior approval from HM Government (with control being defined as the ability to control the Company's affairs by reason of the holding of shares or by means of voting or other powers). If such approval is not obtained, the MOD reserves the right to terminate the agreement.

- The Engineering Delivery Partner Agreement placed with QinetiQ Limited by the MOD came into force on 5 October 2018 and has a 10-year duration. The contract contains a provision under which any change of control of QinetiQ Limited requires prior approval from HM Government (with control being defined as the ability to control the Company's affairs by reason of the holding of shares or by means of voting or other powers). The MOD is entitled to terminate the contract where a change of control has occurred without such approval having been obtained.

- The Group is party to funding agreements, provided by a consortium of banks: a £275m multi-currency revolving credit facility which was due to mature on 27 September 2025 has been replaced, as at 22 April 2024, with a £290m multi-currency revolving credit facility, which will mature on 22 April 2027; with two one-year options to extend the final maturity to 22 April 2029; a multi-currency floating rate term loan of £336m which matures on 27 September 2026, with a one-year option to extend the final maturity to 27 September 2027; and interest rate derivative contracts over three and five years to fix the floating rate bank borrowings in line with Treasury policy. Under the terms of the agreements, in the event of a change of control of the Company, any lender may give notice to cancel its commitment and require all outstanding amounts to be repaid.

The Directors' contracts contain no provisions for compensation for loss of office on a change of control of the Company.

# Disclosures in accordance with Listing Rule 9.8.4

There are no matters requiring disclosure under the FCA's Listing Rule 9.8.4, other than details of long-term incentive schemes, which are explained further on page 112.

# Articles of Association

Changes to the Articles must be submitted to shareholders for approval Save in respect of the rights attaching to the Special Share, the Company has not adopted any special rules relating to the appointment and replacement of Directors or the amendment of the Company's Articles of Association, other than as provided under UK corporate law.

# Appointment and replacement of Directors

According to the Articles of Association, all Directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first AGM following their appointment, and must stand for re-election at intervals of no more than three years thereafter. In line with best practice reflected in the UK Corporate Governance Code, however, the Company requires each serving member of the Board to stand for election or re-election on an annual basis at each AGM.

# Powers of the Directors: allotment/purchase of own shares

At the company's AGM held in July 2023, the shareholders passed resolutions which authorised the Directors to allot relevant securities up to an aggregate nominal value of £1,928,997 (£3,857,994 pursuant only to a rights issue) and to disapply pre-emption rights (up to  $5\%$  of the issued ordinary share capital). The authorities will remain valid until the 2024 AGM.

The authority to purchase ordinary shares (up to  $10\%$  of the issued ordinary share capital) was granted at the Company's AGM in July 2023, however this was incorrectly expressed to expire at the annual general meeting in 2024 or on 20 October 2023, whichever is the earlier. At a general meeting on 6 February 2024, authority to purchase ordinary shares (up to  $5\%$  of the issued ordinary share capital) was granted in connection with the share Buyback programme announced by the Company on 16 January 2024. This authority will remain valid until the Annual General Meeting in 2024 or on 20 October 2024, whichever is the earlier.

Resolutions in respect of the allotment of relevant securities, the disapplication of pre-exemption rights and the purchase of own shares will be laid before the 2024 AGM.

# Annual General Meeting

The Company's AGM will be held on Thursday 18 July 2024 at 11:00 at the office of Ashurst LLP, London Fruit and Wool Exchange, Duval Square, London E1 6PW.

# Report on the audit of the financial statements

# Opinion

In our opinion:

- QinetiQ Group plc's group financial statements and company financial statements (the "financial statements") give a true and fair view of the state of the group's and of the company's affairs as at 31 March 2024 and of the group's profit and the group's cash flows for the year then ended;  
the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006;  
- the company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 "Reduced Disclosure Framework", and applicable law); and  
- the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report & Accounts 2024 (the "Annual Report"), which comprise: the Consolidated and Company balance sheets as at 31 March 2024; the Consolidated income statement, the Consolidated comprehensive income statement, the Consolidated cash flow statement and the Consolidated and Company statements of changes in equity for the year then ended; and the notes to the financial statements, comprising material accounting policy information and other explanatory information.

Our opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.

# Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) ("ISAs (UK)" and applicable law. Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

# Independence

We remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC's Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

To the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard were not provided.

Other than those disclosed in Note 8, we have provided no non-audit services to the company or its controlled undertakings in the period under audit.

# Our audit approach

# Overview

# Audit scope

- We conducted full scope audit work in the United Kingdom over QinetiQ Limited, in the United States over QinetiQ Inc. (C5ISR) and Avantus Federal, and in Australia over QinetiQ Pty Ltd based on their size. This provides significant coverage over all financial statement balances, except inventory;  
- We performed a full scope financial statement line item audit over inventory balances at Foster-Miller Inc. (Technology Solutions) and QinetiQ Target Systems Limited to provide sufficient overall group coverage;  
- Additionally in Technology Solutions, we performed full scope financial statement line item audits over cash and cash equivalents, revenue and associated balances;  
- We performed procedures over goodwill, intangible assets, share-based payments, the defined benefit pension scheme, IFRS 16 lease accounting, taxation, borrowings and testing of the consolidation at a group level.

# Key audit matters

- Long-term contract accounting (group);  
- Impairment of goodwill and acquired intangibles (group);  
Impairment of investments in subsidiary undertakings (parent).

# Materiality

- Overall group materiality: £11,300,000 (2023: £7,950,000) based on 5% of underlying profit before tax;  
- Overall company materiality: £5,300,000 (2023: £5,000,000) based on 1% of total assets;  
- Performance materiality: £8,475,000 (2023: £6,000,000) (group) and £3,975,000 (2023: £3,750,000) (company).

# The scope of our audit

As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements.

# Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors' professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

Acquisition accounting (Avantus Federal), which was a key audit matter last year, is no longer included because of no acquisitions being made during the year. Otherwise, the key audit matters below are consistent with last year.

# Key audit matter

# How our audit addressed the key audit matter

# Long-term contract accounting (group)

Refer to page 100 (Audit Committee report) and page 183 (note 36, material accounting policies - Revenue from contracts with customers) and page 146 (note 2, Revenue from contracts with customers and other income).

We evaluated the contract governance policies and controls in place within the business and tested the design and operating effectiveness of certain key controls over long-term contracts.

QinetiQ Group plc has a large number of contracts which span multiple periods and are accounted for on a percentage of completion (POC) basis in accordance with IFRS 15. Long term contract accounting requires a number of judgements and management estimates to be made, particularly in calculating the forecast costs to complete the contract. These judgements drive revenue and profit recognition, and together with cash paid by the customer, impact the balance sheet position at the year end. Onerous contract provisions are recorded where there is an expectation that a contract will be loss-making, and judgement is applied to determine the magnitude of any provision. Particular focus is given to contracts which are technologically challenging.

We performed risk assessment procedures over the portfolio of contracts to identify higher-risk contracts. These higher risk contracts were selected for detailed contract audits. These detailed contract audits involved meeting with key financial and non-financial personnel throughout the year and at year end to discuss contract performance, as well as challenging management to provide evidence to support contract financials. Specifically, our procedures included the following: We assessed the basis of revenue recognition to ensure it is in line with applicable accounting standards. We agreed overall anticipated revenue to the underlying contract and validated a sample of customer invoices through to cash receipt. We recalculated revenue recognised and agreed revenue, costs and associated balance sheet positions to the underlying general ledger. We obtained evidence to corroborate management estimates and judgements, particularly around forecast costs to complete and risk contingencies. We validated costs incurred allocated to contracts during the year to supporting documentation. For the remaining untested contracts, we selected a sample and performed testing over revenue and costs, agreeing to supporting documentation including customer contracts and validating a sample of customer invoices to cash receipts. Additional testing was performed, where not sufficiently covered by the above, over the contract asset and liability balance sheet positions to gain assurance over the accuracy of these balances. These have been sample tested and agreed to supporting documentation. No material exceptions were found

# Impairment of goodwill and acquired intangibles (group)

Refer to page 100 (Audit Committee report), page 187 (note 36, Material accounting policies - Impairment of goodwill and tangible, intangible and held for sale assets), page 154 (note 14, Goodwill) and page 156 (note 15, Intangible assets).

Our audit focused on the risk that the carrying value of goodwill and acquired intangible assets could be overstated. A greater level of testing was performed over the Avantis, US C5ISR, US Technology Solutions and Germany cash-generating units (CGUs), being the CGUs with more significant assumptions than the other CGUs.

The group has a material amount of goodwill and acquired intangible assets (£401.4m and £251.2m respectively at 31 March 2024). There is a risk of impairment where the performance of the cash generating unit is behind expectation and does not support the value held on the balance sheet. Management performed a discounted cash flow analysis based on the Board-approved five-year strategic plan to assess whether the goodwill and acquired intangible assets are supported by future cash flow projections. This annual impairment review was performed as at 31 January 2024. No triggering events have been identified in the period to 31 March 2024 and therefore no additional impairment reviews have been performed. No impairment charge has been recognised during the year.

We assessed the design and implementation of the goodwill impairment processes and related controls; however, we concluded that we would not rely on the controls over financial reporting and therefore we performed only substantive procedures in this area.

We have tested the principles and mathematical integrity of the group's discounted cash flow model used to assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment. With the assistance of our valuation specialists, we assessed the long-term growth rates and discount rates used in the impairment calculation, by comparing the group's assumptions to external data.

We concluded that the group's assumptions were materially appropriate. We confirmed that cash flows for the next 5 years, consistent with internal budgeting and strategic planning processes and the long term viability assessment, have been input to the model and that the underlying budgets and strategic plans have been approved by the Board.

In respect of the heightened risk CGUs (Avantus, US C5ISR, US Technology Solutions and Germany CGUs), we challenged the cash flow projections (driven principally by revenue growth) used within the model by reference to current cash flows, analysis of management's historic growth rates, understanding future market growth and contract opportunities through obtaining third party evidence where possible. We held discussions with financial and non-financial personnel, corroborating explanations to supporting evidence.

We tested the sensitivity of the impairment calculations to changes in the underlying assumptions and concluded that no impairments are required, and that the sensitivity to key assumptions is sufficiently disclosed. We did not identify any indication of management bias and did not identify any impairment triggers which would require an updated impairment assessment in the intervening period to year end.

<table><tr><td>Key audit matter</td><td>How our audit addressed the key audit matter</td></tr><tr><td>Impairment of investments in subsidiary undertakings (parent)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Refer to page 195 (Accounting policies – Investments and note 2, Investments in subsidiary undertakings).</td><td>We have evaluated management’s consideration of impairment triggers through performing our own independent assessment, which has included;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4">The company has investments of £530.5m in its subsidiary undertakings.

No such indicators of impairment have been identified.</td><td>We found that management’s conclusion, that there are no impairment triggers in the investments in subsidiaries carrying value, was reasonable.</td></tr></table>

# How we tailored the audit scope

We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the group and the company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which they operate.

We conducted full scope audit work over QinetiQ Limited, C5ISR, Avantus and QinetiQ Pty Ltd, with QinetiQ Limited being the only component considered financially significant to the group. The audit of QinetiQ Limited is performed in the United Kingdom and the audit of C5ISR, Avantus and QinetiQ Pty Ltd are performed by our local PwC component teams based in the United States and Australia, respectively. This provides sufficient coverage over all financial statement balances, except inventory and central balances audited by the group team.

We performed additional procedures over inventory balances at two further entities to ensure sufficient coverage over that financial statement line item. QinetiQ Target Systems Limited is located within the UK and work was performed by the group audit team. Technology Solutions is located in the United States and work was performed by our local PwC component audit team.

We performed additional procedures over revenue and associated financial statement balances at Technology Solutions, located in the United States, which was performed by our local PwC component team.

In addition to the above, we performed analytical procedures on the remaining entities to understand key balances and transactions in the year and performed additional procedures on any unusual balances identified.

The audit procedures performed over the financial information of full scope components, QinetiQ Limited, C5ISR, Avantus Federal and QinetiQ Pty Ltd, accounted for  $88\%$  of consolidated group revenue and  $89\%$  of underlying profit before taxation (on an absolute basis, excluding holding companies and consolidation entities).

The full scope audits plus the additional audit procedures over inventory in two other locations and cash and cash equivalents, revenue and associated balance sheet accounts within Technology Solutions, resulted in coverage of  $92\%$  of consolidated group revenue and  $87\%$  of total group assets.

The combination of the work referred to above, together with additional procedures performed at a group level, including testing of significant journals posted within the consolidation, significant adjustments made to the financial statements, goodwill, intangible assets, share-based payments, pensions, IFRS 16 lease accounting, taxation and borrowings gave us the evidence required for our opinion on the financial statements as a whole.

The group engagement leader discussed and agreed the audit plan with our component audit teams, in addition to agreeing the format and content of communications. We determined that the level of involvement we were able to have in the audit work at our reporting entities was sufficient, and appropriate audit evidence had been obtained, to enable us to form our opinion on the financial statements as a whole. The group engagement leader visited our local PwC component team and the local management team in the United States as part of our planning procedures. We maintained regular dialogue throughout the audit process with our component audit teams through the use of video conferencing. We also supervised the work performed by all component teams through the review of component team working papers and we concluded that sufficient and appropriate procedures have been performed.

The company audit was performed by the group audit team. The parent company is principally a holding company and there are no branches or other locations to be considered when scoping the audit. There are no financial statement line items in scope for the group audit. The company is audited on a stand-alone basis, and hence, testing has been performed on all material financial statement line items.

# The impact of climate risk on our audit

As part of our audit we made enquiries of management to understand the extent of the potential impact of climate risk on the group's and company's financial statements, and we remained alert when performing our audit procedures for any indicators of the impact of climate risk. In particular, when carrying out our work over long term contracts we challenged management over the impact of climate change (e.g. flooding at exposed areas) on the forecasted costs to complete as well as any potential risks arising from physical and environmental issues. Our procedures did not identify any material impact as a result of climate risk on the group's and company's financial statements.

# Materiality

The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Financial statements - group</td><td>Financial statements - company</td></tr><tr><td>Overall materiality</td><td>£11,300,000 (2023: £7,950,000).</td><td>£5,300,000 (2023: £5,000,000).</td></tr><tr><td>How we determined it</td><td>5% of underlying profit before tax</td><td>1% of total assets</td></tr><tr><td>Rationale for benchmark applied</td><td>Underlying profit before tax is one of the primary measures used by the shareholders in assessing the performance of the group, and is a generally accepted auditing benchmark. It is considered appropriate to exclude specific adjusting items due to the nature of these balances as disclosed in note 4 of the financial statements.</td><td>We believe that total assets is the primary measure used by shareholders in assessing the performance of this entity, and is a generally accepted auditing benchmark for a holding company. This materiality relates to the audit of the parent company only, as the parent company was not in scope for the group audit.</td></tr></table>

For each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between £6,000,000 and £9,900,000. Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall group materiality.

We use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality. Specifically, we use performance materiality in determining the scope of our audit and the nature and extent of our testing of account balances, classes of transactions and disclosures, for example in determining sample sizes. Our performance materiality was  $75\%$  (2023:  $75\%$ ) of overall materiality, amounting to £8,475,000 (2023: £6,000,000) for the group financial statements and £3,975,000 (2023: £3,750,000) for the company financial statements.

In determining the performance materiality, we considered a number of factors - the history of misstatements, risk assessment and aggregation risk and the effectiveness of controls - and concluded that an amount at the upper end of our normal range was appropriate.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £525,000 (group audit) (2023: £400,000) and £265,000 (company audit) (2023: £250,000) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

# Conclusions relating to going concern

Our evaluation of the directors' assessment of the group's and the company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:

- Obtaining management's Board-approved strategic plan. We held discussions with management to understand the budgeting process and the key assumptions made in the forecasting processes, over management's going concern assessment period;  
- Performing a comparison of the cash flow forecasts used in the going concern assessment to those in the strategic plan and, where applicable, compared these forecasts for consistency to those used elsewhere in the business, including for long term contract accounting and impairment assessments;  
- Assessing whether the stress testing performed by management appropriately considered the principal risks facing the business, and were adequate;  
- Using our own knowledge from the audit and assessment of previous forecasting accuracy we calculated sensitivities to apply to management's cash flow forecasts. These procedures confirmed significant liquidity and covenant headroom in management's forecasts when performing severe but plausible sensitivities;  
- Evaluating the feasibility of management's mitigating actions in response to the severe stress testing scenarios; and  
- We assessed the adequacy of disclosures in the Going Concern statement on page 64, the Audit Committee report on page 100 and statements in Note 36 of the Financial Statements and found these appropriately reflect our understanding of the process undertaken and the conclusion reached.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group's and the company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.

In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.

However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the group's and the company's ability to continue as a going concern.

In relation to the directors' reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.

# Reporting on other information

The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors' report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.

With respect to the Strategic report and Directors' Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.

Based on our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006 requires us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below.

# Strategic report and Directors' Report

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic report and Directors' Report for the year ended 31 March 2024 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic report and Directors' Report.

# Directors' Remuneration

In our opinion, the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

# Corporate governance statement

The Listing Rules require us to review the directors' statements in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the corporate governance statement relating to the company's compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review. Our additional responsibilities with respect to the corporate governance statement as other information are described in the Reporting on other information section of this report.

Based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate governance statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit, and we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:

- The directors' confirmation that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks;  
- The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those principal risks, what procedures are in place to identify emerging risks and an explanation of how these are being managed or mitigated;  
- The directors' statement in the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any material uncertainties to the group's and company's ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements;  
- The directors' explanation as to their assessment of the group's and company's prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate; and  
- The directors' statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of its assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.

Our review of the directors' statement regarding the longer-term viability of the group and company was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors' process supporting their statement; checking that the statement is in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code; and considering whether the statement is consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge and understanding of the group and company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit.

In addition, based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate governance statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit:

- The directors' statement that they consider the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the group's and company's position, performance, business model and strategy.  
- The section of the Annual Report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems; and  
- The section of the Annual Report describing the work of the Audit Committee.

We have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when the directors' statement relating to the company's compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the Code specified under the Listing Rules for review by the auditors.

# Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements

As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors' responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group's and the company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

# Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.

Based on our understanding of the group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations related to Single Source Contracting Regulations, the Health and Safety Executive and anti-bribery and corruption legislation, and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the financial statements such as the Companies Act 2006 and relevant tax legislation. We evaluated management's incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were related to posting inappropriate journal entries to increase revenue as well as considering management bias in accounting estimates.

The group engagement team shared this risk assessment with the component auditors so that they could include appropriate audit procedures in response to such risks in their work. Audit procedures performed by the group engagement team and/or component auditors included:

- Discussions with management at multiple levels across the business, internal audit and the group's legal counsel throughout the year, as well as at year end. These discussions have included consideration of known or suspected instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations and fraud;  
- Evaluation of management's controls designed to prevent and detect irregularities, in particular their anti-bribery controls;  
- Assessment of matters reported on the group's whistleblowing helpline and the results of management's investigation of such matters;  
- Reviewing correspondence with and reporting to relevant regulatory authorities;  
- Challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in their significant accounting estimates and judgements, particularly in relation to the key audit matters above;  
- Designing risk filters to search for journal entries, such as those posted with unusual account combinations, and testing those journals highlighted (if any); and  
- Incorporating elements of unpredictability into the audit procedures performed.

There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions reflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.

Our audit testing might include testing complete populations of certain transactions and balances, possibly using data auditing techniques. However, it typically involves selecting a limited number of items for testing, rather than testing complete populations. We will often seek to target particular items for testing based on their size or risk characteristics. In other cases, we will use audit sampling to enable us to draw a conclusion about the population from which the sample is selected.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC's website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors' report.

# Use of this report

This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the company's members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.

# Other required reporting

# Companies Act 2006 exception reporting

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

- we have not obtained all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or  
- adequate accounting records have not been kept by the company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or  
- certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or  
- the company financial statements and the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.

We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

# Appointment

Following the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were appointed by the members on 22 June 2017 to audit the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2018 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is 7 years, covering the years ended 31 March 2018 to 31 March 2024.

# Other matter

The company is required by the Financial Conduct Authority Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules to include these financial statements in an annual financial report prepared under the structured digital format required by DTR 4.1.15R - 4.1.18R and filed on the National Storage Mechanism of the Financial Conduct Authority. This auditors' report provides no assurance over whether the structured digital format annual financial report has been prepared in accordance with those requirements.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

For the year ended 31 March

# 1. Significant changes in the current reporting period

The financial position and performance of the Group was particularly affected by the following events and transactions during the reporting period:

1) A £331.4m increase in revenue due to the full year impact of acquisitions made in the prior year as well as organic growth (note 2)  
2) A £101.4m reduction in the net surplus of the Group's defined benefit pension scheme (note 28)  
3) A £79.8m increase in the balance of cash and cash equivalents following strong operating cash performance, offset by capex, tax, dividends and share buy back purchases.  
4) A £51.1m reduction in equity due to the purchase and irrevocable commitment to acquire own shares as part of the share buy back programme

For a detailed discussion of the Group's performance and financial position refer to the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 69.

# 3. Segmental analysis

The analysis by business segment is presented in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments, on the basis of those reportable segments whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Board (the Chief Operating Decision Maker as defined by IFRS 8) and are aligned with the Group's strategic direction, determined with reference to the products and services they provide, as follows:

EMEA Services provides technical assurance, test and evaluation and training services, underpinned by long-term contracts. EMEA Services comprises the following business units which are not considered reportable segments as defined by IFRS 8: UK Defence, UK Intelligence and the Australia sector.

Global Solutions combines all other business units not aggregated within EMEA Services, including the QinetiQ US sector and Other Products (which includes QinetiQ Target Systems). Generally these business units (which are not considered reportable segments as defined by IFRS 8) deliver innovative solutions and products which includes contract-funded research and development and developing intellectual property in partnership with key customers and through internal funding with potential for new revenue streams.

# 4. Specific adjusting items

In the income statement, the Group presents specific adjusting items separately. In the judgement of the Directors, for the reader to obtain a proper understanding of the financial information, specific adjusting items need to be disclosed separately because of their size and nature. Further explanation of this rationale is provided in note 36 (Accounting Policies). Underlying measures of performance exclude specific adjusting items. The following specific adjusting items have been (charged)/credited in the consolidated income statement:

The total impact of specific adjusting items (which are excluded from underlying performance due to their distorting nature) on operating profit was a £49.9m cost (FY23: cost of £23.5m).

Acquisition and disposal costs of £2.7m (FY23: £16.4m) comprise costs associated with an aborted acquisition attempt during the year, as well as a number of ongoing disposal projects. Acquisition integration costs of £5.3m (FY23: £2.0m) comprise costs associated with the Avantus and Air Affairs acquisitions which were completed in H2 of FY23. Acquisition related remuneration relates to specific post-deal retention arrangements relating to Avantus employees.

We continue to deliver on our digital investment programme to modernise the IT infrastructure to support our future growth ambitions. The non-recurring costs will be reported as specific adjusting items in the P&L, with ongoing recurring operating costs (such as licence costs and overheads) remaining within underlying operating costs. In FY24 the non-recurring cost of the digital investment programme is £16.9m (FY23: £5.8m).

FY23 included exceptional restructuring costs of £5.0m, as part of the significant Group-wide organisation redesign, and a £19.6m credit in respect of UK MOD appropriation for RDEC, following a determination by the Single Source Regulations Office (SSRO) on the interpretation of the Statutory Guidance for Allowable Costs regulations (SGAC). The accounting judgement remains that RDEC on single source contracts from 1 April 2019 onwards will not be paid on to the UK MoD, which was a change from the accounting judgement at the FY22 year end.

Also included within specific adjusting items are a gain on the sale of property of £2.1m (FY23: £2.0m), financing income from pensions of £5.6m (FY23: £9.9m), impairment of right of use lease assets in the US following space relocation of £0.7m, and amortisation of acquisition intangibles of £25.2m (FY23: £15.6m). Amortisation of acquisition intangibles has increased due to the amortisation of new intangible assets recognised on the FY23 acquisitions (primarily the Customer Relationships asset associated with Avantis). FY23 also included a gain of disposal of the Space NV business in Belgium of £15.9m.

The total tax charge was £43.1m (FY23: £37.6m). The underlying tax charge was £57.4m (FY23: £36.8m), on a higher underlying profit before tax, with an underlying effective tax rate of 25.3% for the year ending 31 March 2024 (FY23: 19.4%). The underlying effective tax rate is slightly above the UK statutory rate of 25% (FY23:19%) primarily as a result of higher overseas tax rates and non-deductible overseas interest offset by prior year adjustments to returns.

# Tax on specific adjusting items

The total specific adjusting items tax credit £14.3m (FY23 charge: £0.8m). The tax credit primarily arises on intangible amortisation and tax deductible digital investment, acquisition and integration costs.

# Amounts recognised directly in equity

Current and deferred tax not recognised in net profit or loss or other comprehensive income but directly debited or credited to equity were:

# Factors affecting future tax charges

The underlying effective tax rate is expected to remain marginally above the UK statutory rate, subject to the impact of any tax legislation changes and the geographic mix of profits. The Group has engaged with advisers to assess any potential impact on the tax charge by the UK's enactment of the OECD's Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (Pillar Two). The Group performed an assessment of the potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes based on current period data. The Group believes it qualifies for one of the transitional safe harbours provided in the rules in all territories in which it operates. Therefore, the Group does not anticipate a material impact from Pillar II legislation in the near future. The Group has applied the temporary exemption issued by the International Accounting Standards Board from the accounting for deferred taxes under IAS12 and neither recognises nor discloses information about deferred taxes related to Pillar Two income taxes. The Group does not anticipate a material quantitative impact from Pillar Two legislation, however, there are expected to be significant compliance obligations.

# 10. Earnings per share

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. The weighted average number of shares used excludes those shares bought by the Group and held as own shares (see note 29). For diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares arising from unvested share-based awards including share options.

Goodwill is attributable to the excess of consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired and includes expected synergies, future growth prospects and employee knowledge, expertise and security clearances. The Group tests each CGU for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. Impairment testing is dependent on management's estimates and judgements, particularly as they relate to the forecasting of future cash flows, the discount rates selected and expected long-term growth rates. There are no likely variations in the key assumptions used for any of the CGUs which would lead to an impairment being recognised.

# Key assumptions

# Cash flows

The value-in-use calculations generally use discounted future cash flows based on financial plans approved by the Board covering a five-year period (aligned with the Group's Integrated Strategic Business Plan process and the longer-term viability assessment period). These are generally 'bottom-up' forecasts based on detailed analysis by contract for the revenue under contract and by opportunity for the pipeline, or with growth rates assumed based on market benchmarks. Pipeline opportunities are categorised as 'base case' and 'high case' by management and only 'base case' opportunities are included in the financial plans used for the value-in-use calculations.

Cash flows beyond these periods are extrapolated based on the last year of the plans, with a terminal growth-rate assumption applied. Whilst the Group will likely be impacted by climate change in the future to an extent, the impacts on future cash flows used in the value-in-use calculations are not considered to be material.

# Terminal growth rates and discount rates

The specific plans for each of the CGUs have been extrapolated using the terminal growth rates as detailed in the following table. Growth rates are based on management's estimates which take into consideration the long-term nature of the industry in which the CGUs operate and external forecasts as to the likely growth of the industry in the longer term. The discount rates used are calculated based on the weighted average cost of capital of a portfolio of comparable companies, adjusted for risks specific to the market characteristics of each CGU, on a pre-tax basis. This is considered an appropriate estimate of a market participant discount rate.

Sensitivity analysis shows that the value of the terminal year cash flow, the discount rate and the terminal growth rates have a significant impact on the value of the discounted cash flows. Sensitivities are provided below for each of the CGUs.

# Results of impairment testing by CGU

# US Technology Solutions

The carrying value of the goodwill for the US Technology Solutions CGU was £43.1m as at 31 March 2024 (2023: £44.1m). The recoverable amount of this CGU as at 31 March 2024, based on value in use and calculated using the assumptions noted above, is higher than the carrying value of net operating assets (of £120.2m). The key sensitivity impacting on the value in use calculations is the terminal year cash flows. An increase in the discount rate of  $1\%$ , a decrease in the terminal growth rate of  $1\%$  or a decrease in the terminal year cash flows of $2.0m, all of which are reasonably possible changes, would not cause the net operating assets to exceed their recoverable amount.

# US C5ISR

The carrying value of the goodwill for the US C5ISR CGU as at 31 March 2024 was £36.0m (2023: £36.8m). The recoverable amount of this CGU as at 31 March 2024, based on value in use and calculated using the assumptions noted above, is higher than the carrying value of net operating assets (of £91.2m). The key sensitivity impacting on the value in use calculations is the terminal year cash flows. An increase in the discount rate of  $1\%$ , a decrease in the terminal growth rate of  $1\%$  or a decrease in the terminal year cash flows of $2.0m, all of which are reasonably possible changes, would not cause the net operating assets to exceed their recoverable amount.

# Avantus

The carrying value of the goodwill for the Avantus CGU as at 31 March 2024 was £252.5m (2023: £257.8m). The recoverable amount of this CGU as at 31 March 2024, based on value in use and calculated using the assumptions noted above, is higher than the carrying value of the net operating assets (of £411.7m). The key sensitivity impacting on the value in use calculations is the terminal year cash flows. The key assumption impacting those terminal year cash flows is the revenue growth rate applied over the period of the value in use calculation, which is based on market growth rates for the high growth segments in which the business operates in. A 400 basis point reduction in the compound annual revenue growth rate over the period, which is considered a reasonably possible change, would not cause the net operating assets to exceed their recoverable amount. An increase in the discount rate of  $1\%$  or a decrease in the terminal growth rate of  $1\%$ , both of which are also reasonably possible changes, would not cause the net operating assets to exceed their recoverable amount.

# Target Systems

The carrying value of the goodwill for the Target Systems CGU as at 31 March 2024 was £24.4m (2023: £24.5m). The recoverable amount of this CGU as at 31 March 2024, based on value in use and calculated using the assumptions noted above, is higher than the carrying value of net operating assets (of £92.0m). The key sensitivity impacting on the value in use calculations is the terminal year cash flows. An increase in the discount rate of  $1\%$ , a decrease in the terminal growth rate of  $1\%$  or a decrease in the terminal year cash flows of £2.0m, all of which are reasonably possible changes, would not cause the net operating assets to exceed their recoverable amount.

# Germany

The carrying value of the goodwill for the Germany CGU as at 31 March 2024 was £2.7m (2023: £2.7m). The recoverable amount of this CGU as at 31 March 2024, based on value in use and calculated using the assumptions noted above, is higher than the carrying value of net operating assets (of £52.6m). Confidence in the business prospects over the next five years has increased during the year, with a healthy pipeline of opportunities. The key sensitivity affecting on the value in use calculations is the terminal year cash flows. These cash flows include certain assumptions around utilisation of aircraft, renewal of existing contracts and successful winning of new business opportunities. An increase in the discount rate of  $1\%$ , a decrease in the terminal growth rate of  $1\%$  or a decrease in the terminal year cash flows of £2.0m, all of which are reasonably possible changes, would not cause the net operating assets to exceed their recoverable amount.

# Naimuri

The carrying value of the goodwill for the Naimuri CGU as at 31 March 2024 was £14.8m (2023: £14.8m). The recoverable amount of this CGU as at 31 March 2024, based on value in use and calculated using the assumptions noted above, is higher than the carrying value of net operating assets (of £23.6m). The key sensitivity affecting on the value in use calculations is the terminal year cash flows. An increase in the discount rate of  $1\%$ , a decrease in the terminal growth rate of  $1\%$  or a decrease in the terminal year cash flows of £1.0m, all of which are reasonably possible changes, would not cause the net operating assets to exceed their recoverable amount.

# Inzpire

The carrying value of the goodwill for the Inzpire CGU as at 31 March 2024 was £11.7m (2023: £11.7m). The recoverable amount of this CGU as at 31 March 2024, based on value in use and calculated using the assumptions noted above, is higher than the carrying value of net operating assets (of £20.8m). The key sensitivity impacting on the value in use calculations is the terminal year cash flows. An increase in the discount rate of  $1\%$ , a decrease in the terminal growth rate of  $1\%$  or a decrease in the terminal year cash flows of £1.0m, all of which are reasonably possible changes, would not cause the net operating assets to exceed their recoverable amount.

# QinetiQ Training & Simulation

The carrying value of the goodwill for the QinetiQ Training and Simulation CGU as at 31 March 2024 was £7.8m (2023: £7.8m). The recoverable amount of this CGU as at 31 March 2024, based on value in use and calculated using the assumptions noted above, is higher than the carrying value of net operating assets (of £11.6m). The key sensitivity impacting on the value in use calculations is the terminal year cash flows. An increase in the discount rate of  $1\%$ , a decrease in the terminal growth rate of  $1\%$  or a decrease in the terminal year cash flows of £1.0m, all of which are reasonably possible changes, would not cause the net operating assets to exceed their recoverable amount.

# Australia

The carrying value of the goodwill for the Australia CGU, as at 31 March 2024 was £5.6m (2023: £5.8m). The recoverable amount of this CGU as at 31 March 2024, based on value in use and calculated using the assumptions noted above, is higher than the carrying value of net operating assets (of £15.5m). The key sensitivity impacting on the value in use calculations is the terminal year cash flows. An increase in the discount rate of  $1\%$ , a decrease in the terminal growth rate of  $1\%$  or a decrease in the terminal year cash flows of A$2.0m, all of which are reasonably possible changes, would not cause the net operating assets to exceed their recoverable amount.

# Air Affairs Australia

The carrying value of the goodwill for the Air Affairs Australia CGU as at 31 March 2024 was £2.8m (2023: £3.0m). The recoverable amount of this CGU as at 31 March 2024, based on value in use and calculated using the assumptions noted above, is higher than the carrying value of net operating assets (of £36.0m). The key sensitivity impacting on the value in use calculations is the terminal year cash flows. An increase in the discount rate of  $1\%$  or a decrease in the terminal growth rate of  $1\%$  or a decrease in the terminal year cash flows of A\$1.0m, all of which are reasonably possible changes, would not cause the net operating assets to exceed their recoverable amount.

# 16. Property, plant and equipment (continued)

During the year a £2.1m gain was recognised on the sale of property which had a carrying value of nil. This gain is included within other income as a specific adjusting item (see note 4). Whilst the Group will likely be impacted by climate change in the future to an extent, the impact on the carrying value of property, plant and equipment is not considered to be material.

Deferred tax has been calculated at the rate at which the timing difference is expected to reverse using enacted future statutory rates. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and where the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority.

At 31 March 2024 the Group had unused tax losses and carried forward interest expense of £212.3m (31 March 2023: £175.6m) which are available for offset against future taxable profits. Deferred tax assets are recognised on the balance sheet of £29.0m in respect of £109.8m of US net operating losses, £4.9m in respect of £20.9m of Canadian net operating losses and £2.0m in respect of £6.8m of German trade losses. A deferred tax asset of £1.0m is recognised in respect of £3.3m of German excess interest. No deferred tax asset is recognised in respect of the £71.5m of US interest deductions due to uncertainty over the timing and extent of their utilisation. Full recognition of the US carried forward interest expense would increase the deferred tax asset by £19.3m.

The Group has £32.4m of time-limited US net operating losses of which £22.9m will expire in 2035 and £9.5m in 2036. The Group made overseas losses in the period ended 31 March 2024 and recognition of deferred tax assets is dependent on future forecast taxable profits. The Group has reviewed the latest forecasts for these businesses which incorporate the unsystematic risks of operating in the defence business. In the period beyond the 5 year forecast we have reviewed the terminal period profits and based on these and our expectations for these businesses we believe it is probable the losses, with the exception of the interest deductions, will be fully utilised. Based on the current forecasts the losses will be fully utilised over the next 9-11 years. A  $10\%$  change in the forecast profits would alter the utilisation period by 3 years.

There are no material temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries or interests in joint ventures for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised.

Trade and other receivables includes assets that are realised as part of the business's normal operating cycle, including amounts of £0.8m (2023: £4.0m) that are not expected to be realised within 12 months of the year end. Credit risk is limited as a result of the high percentage of revenue derived from UK and US government agencies. Accordingly, the Directors believe that no credit provision in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts is required. As at 31 March 2024 the Group carried a loss allowance in respect of expected credit risk of £1.7m (2023: £1.6m).

Contract assets increased during the year due to the growth in revenue. Contract assets represents unbilled amounts recoverable under customer contracts (refer to accounting policies note 36).

Property provisions relate to dilapidations and under-utilised properties. The under-utilised property provision is affected by the timing of when properties can be sub-let and the proportion of space that can be sub-let. Other provisions include £12.8m (2023: £14.2m) in respect of a civil liability for the Pendine incident. This is offset in Other Receivables for an insurance recoverable. There is uncertainty around the timing of the utilisation of this balance although this will not impact cash or the P&L. The remaining balance relates to environmental and other liabilities, the magnitude and timing of utilisation of which are determined by a variety of factors.

Lease payments represent capital and interest payable by the Group on certain property, plant and equipment. Principal leases are negotiated for a term of approximately 10 years.

# 27. Financial risk management

The Group's international operations expose it to financial risks that include the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risks and liquidity risks.

Treasury and risk management policies, which are set by the Board, specify guidelines on financial risks and the use of financial instruments to manage risk. The instruments and techniques used to manage exposures include foreign currency and interest rate swap derivatives. Group treasury monitors financial risks and compliance with risk management policies during the year. There have been no changes in any risk management policies during the year or since the year end. For details of the Group's Treasury policy and management of financial instruments see 'Additional Financial Information' on page 198.

The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. The Group has a revolving credit facility and floating rate term loan with its relationship banks with a requirement for the half yearly testing period that the ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA will not exceed 3.5:1 and the ratio of EBITDA to net finance charges will not be less than 4:1. The Group complied with both covenants during the year. As at 31 March 2024, the ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA was 0.5:1 and the ratio of EBITDA to net finance charges was 23.1:1. The revolving credit facility is undrawn at the year end and post year end was refinanced to mature in 2027. The floating rate term loan is repayable in 2026 and has a one-year extension option.

# A) Fair values of financial instruments

The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined as follows:

Level 1 - measured using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

Level 2 - measured using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Level 2 derivatives comprise forward foreign exchange contracts which have been fair valued using forward exchange rates that are quoted in an active market; and interest rate swaps which have been fair valued using interest rates that are quoted in an active market

Level 3 - measured using inputs for the assets or liability that are not based on observable market data (i.e. unobservable inputs).

The following table presents the Group's assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value as at 31 March 2024:

<table><tr><td>All figures in £ million</td><td>Note</td><td>Level 1</td><td>Level 2</td><td>Level 3</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>Assets</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Current derivative financial instruments</td><td>24</td><td>-</td><td>5.2</td><td>-</td><td>5.2</td></tr><tr><td>Non-current derivative financial instruments</td><td>24</td><td>-</td><td>3.8</td><td>-</td><td>3.8</td></tr><tr><td>Liabilities</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Current derivative financial instruments</td><td>24</td><td>-</td><td>(1.1)</td><td>-</td><td>(1.1)</td></tr><tr><td>Non-current derivative financial instruments</td><td>24</td><td>-</td><td>(0.4)</td><td>-</td><td>(0.4)</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td>-</td><td>7.5</td><td>-</td><td>7.5</td></tr></table>

The following table presents the Group's assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value as at 31 March 2023:

<table><tr><td>All figures in £ million</td><td>Note</td><td>Level 1</td><td>Level 2</td><td>Level 3</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>Assets</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Current derivative financial instruments</td><td>24</td><td>-</td><td>4.4</td><td>-</td><td>4.4</td></tr><tr><td>Non-current derivative financial instruments</td><td>24</td><td>-</td><td>4.7</td><td>-</td><td>4.7</td></tr></table>

For cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables and bank and current borrowings, the fair value of the financial instruments approximate to their carrying value as a result of the short maturity periods of these financial instruments. For trade and other receivables, allowances are made within the carrying value for credit risk. For other financial instruments, the fair value is based on market value, where available. Where market values are not available, the fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows to net present value using prevailing market-based interest rates translated at the year-end rates, except for unlisted fixed asset investments where fair value equals carrying value. There have been no transfers between levels.

All financial assets and liabilities had a fair value that is identical to book value at 31 March 2024 and 31 March 2023. Detailed analysis is provided in the following tables:

# B) Interest rate risk

The Group's objective is to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on borrowings through varying the proportion of fixed rate debt relative to floating rate debt with debt-related derivative financial instruments, including interest rate and cross-currency swaps.

The Group operates an interest rate policy designed to optimise interest costs and to reduce volatility in reported earnings. The Group's current policy is to require rates to be fixed for  $30\% - 80\%$  of the level of borrowings, which is achieved primarily through fixed-rate borrowings or debt-related derivative financial instruments. Where there are significant changes in the level and/or structure of debt, the policy permits borrowings to be  $100\%$  fixed, with regular Board reviews of the appropriateness of this fixed percentage.

At 31 March 2024, the Group had  $80\%$  (2023:  $80\%$ ) of fixed rate debt and  $20\%$  (2023:  $20\%$ ) of floating rate debt based on gross debt of £336.3m (2023: £337.6m) after including the impact of debt-related derivative financial assets (interest rate swaps).

Sterling assets consist of debt-related derivative financial instruments. Sterling liabilities consist primarily of finance leases with the weighted average interest rate reflecting the internal rate of return of those leases.

# Interest rate risk management

The revolving credit facility (note 27E) is floating-rate and undrawn as at 31 March 2024.

As at 31 March 2024, the majority of the Group's floating rate bank borrowings were fixed through interest rate swaps which swap the

Sterling floating rate interest payable into fixed rate Sterling. The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts

as at 31 March 2024 is £270m (31 March 2023: £270m). The swaps have the economic effect of converting floating rate borrowings into

fixed rate borrowings and are accounted for as cash flow hedges.

For the year ended 31 March

# 27. Financial risk management (continued)

# C) Currency risk

Transactional currency exposure

The Group is exposed to foreign currency risks arising from sales or purchases by businesses in currencies other than their functional currency. It is Group policy that when such a sale or purchase is certain, the net foreign exchange exposure is hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts. Hedge accounting documentation and effectiveness testing are undertaken for all the Group's transactional hedge contracts.

The currency and notional amount of the designated hedging instruments match the currency and principal amounts of the transactions being hedged, therefore the hedging instruments and hedged items have values which will generally move in opposite directions because of the same hedged risk. As the critical terms of the hedging instruments match those of the hedged items, an economic relationship can be demonstrated on an ongoing basis.

The hedge ratio is 1:1 on the basis that the notional amount of the designated hedging instruments matches the principal amount of the foreign currency sales/purchases designated as the hedged items. The Group does not designate groups of items with offsetting risk positions as hedged items.

The Group considers the potential sources of hedge ineffectiveness to be:

valuation adjustments for credit risk made to derivative hedging instruments at each hedge effectiveness measurement date;  
changes to the timing and amount of transactions; and  
non-occurrence of the designated hedged items

Ineffectiveness due to foreign currency basis was highly immaterial.

The table below shows the Group's currency exposures (based on functional currency of the operating company), being exposures on currency transactions that give rise to net currency gains and losses recognised in the income statement. Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating company involved.

<table><tr><td>All figures in £ millions</td><td>US$</td><td>Euro</td><td>A$</td><td>Other</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>31 March 2024 – Sterling</td><td>0.6</td><td>(0.3)</td><td>1.1</td><td>(0.5)</td><td>0.9</td></tr><tr><td>31 March 2023 – Sterling</td><td>17.7</td><td>3.3</td><td>0.9</td><td>4.1</td><td>26.0</td></tr></table>

The amounts shown in the table take into account the effect of the forward contracts entered into to manage these currency exposures. The Group enters into forward foreign currency contracts to hedge the currency exposures that arise on sales and purchases denominated in foreign currencies, as the transaction occurs. The principal contract amounts of the outstanding forward currency contracts as at 31 March 2024 against Sterling are net US dollars sold of  $124.3m (USD 157.4m), net Euros sold$ 28.1m (EUR 34.6m), net Canadian dollars sold £13.6m (CAD 23.7m), net United Arab Emirate Dirhams sold £4.1m (AED 18.9m), net Swedish Krona sold of £2.3m (SEK 29.5m), and net Australian dollars sold £33.9m (AUD 65.6m).

# Translational currency exposure

The Group has significant investments in overseas operations, particularly in the US. As a result, the Sterling value of the Group's balance sheet can be affected by movement in exchange rates. The Group does not hedge against translational currency exposure to overseas net assets.

# D) Financial credit risk

The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments, but does not currently expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations. Credit risk is mitigated by a Board-approved policy of only selecting counterparties with a strong investment grade long-term credit rating for cash deposits and setting a utilisation credit limit based on the credit rating. The cash and cash equivalents of the Group are invested in non-speculative financial instruments which are usually highly liquid, such as short-term deposits. Therefore, the Group believes it has reduced its exposure to counterparty credit risk through this process.

The cash and cash equivalents balance is subject to review for impairment, and due to the high credit ratings of the counterparties set out below, no impairment has been recognised within the year:

<table><tr><td>Counterparty credit rating</td><td>31 March 2024</td><td>31 March 2023</td></tr><tr><td>AAA to AA-</td><td>69%</td><td>72%</td></tr><tr><td>A+ to A-</td><td>30%</td><td>28%</td></tr><tr><td>BBB+ to BBB-</td><td>1%</td><td>0%</td></tr></table>

The Group uses 3 year cumulative default rate metrics to determine the estimated credit-rated losses on our financial instruments. Based on the expected default rates, the financial instruments have an immaterial risk of credit impairment.

In the normal course of business the Group operates notional cash pooling systems and master netting agreements for derivatives, where a legal right of set-off applies.

The maximum credit-risk exposure in the event of other parties failing to perform their obligations under financial assets, excluding trade and other receivables, totals £240.0m (31 March 2023: £160.3m). This balance includes cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial assets. The cash and cash equivalents of £231.0m at 31 March 2023 (2023: £151.2m) represents the maximum credit exposure on these assets. The cash and cash equivalents were held with different financial institutions which were rated single A or better. Cash equivalents comprise £121.5m (31 March 2023: £62.1m) invested in AAA-rated money market funds. The Group's assessment is that credit risk is limited as a result of the high percentage of revenue derived from UK and US government agencies. Therefore the provision for expected credit losses is immaterial in respect of receivables from these customers.

# E) Liquidity risk

Borrowing facilities

As at 31 March 2024 the Group had a revolving credit facility (RCF) of £275.0m (2023: £275.0m) and floating rate term loans of £336.3m (2023: £337.6m). The RCF, which is unutilised, was refinanced in April 2024 and will mature on 22 April 2027. The term loan had an initial term of 3 years and will mature on 27 September 2026, with a one-year extension option. Total available funds, comprising the RCF, term loan and the Group's freely available cash and cash equivalents, are shown in the table below:

# Gross contractual cash flows for borrowings and other financial liabilities

The following are the undiscounted contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including interest payments. The cash flows associated with derivatives that are cash flow hedges are expected to have an impact on profit or loss in the periods shown.

The £336.3m term loan is repayable on 27 September 2026, with a one-year extension option, with interest periods set to three months. The loan bears interest at a variable margin over the relevant reference rate of between  $1.00\%$  and  $2.50\%$  dependent on the ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA.

# H) Sensitivity analysis

The Group's sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates on financial assets and liabilities as at 31 March 2024 is set out in the following table. The impact of a weakening in Sterling on the Group's financial assets and liabilities would be more than offset in equity and income by its impact on the Group's overseas net assets and earnings respectively. Sensitivity on Group's assets other than financial assets and liabilities is not included in this analysis.

The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are forward-looking estimates of market risk assuming that certain market conditions occur. Actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected as a result of developments in global financial markets that may cause fluctuations in interest and exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the previous tables, which should not, therefore, be considered to be a projection of likely future events and losses.

The estimated changes for interest rate movements are based on an instantaneous decrease or increase of  $1\%$  (100 basis points) in the specific rate of interest applicable to each class of financial instruments from the levels effective at 31 March 2024, with all other variables remaining constant. The estimated changes for foreign exchange rates are based on an instantaneous  $10\%$  weakening or strengthening in Sterling against all other currencies from the levels applicable at 31 March 2024, with all other variables remaining constant. Such analysis is for illustrative purposes only - in practice market rates rarely change in isolation. The impact of transactional risk on the Group's monetary assets/liabilities that are not held in the functional currency of the entity holding those assets/liabilities is minimal.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

For the year ended 31 March

# 28. Post-retirement benefits

# Defined contribution plans

The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension arrangements, the largest of which is in the UK and provided by the Mercer Master Trust. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group and employees pay fixed contributions to a third-party financial provider. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due. The expense incurred during the year was £65.0m (FY23: £55.2m). Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.

# Defined benefit pension plan

In the UK the Group operates the QinetiQ Pension Scheme ('the Scheme') for approximately one fifth of its UK employees. The Scheme closed to future accrual on 31 October 2013 and there is no on-going service cost. The Scheme is a final salary plan, which provides benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life.

The level of benefits provided depends on the members' length of service and their final pensionable earnings at closure to future accrual. In the Scheme, pensions in payment are generally updated in line with the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The benefit payments are made from Trustee-administered funds.

Plan assets held in trusts are governed by UK regulations as is the nature of the relationship between the Group and the Trustees and their composition. Responsibility for the governance of the Scheme - including investment decisions and contribution schedules - lies with the Scheme Trustee with consultation with the Company as needed. On 1 October 2023 the Scheme and Company changed the governance model from being governed by a board of trustees comprised of current/prior employees to a sole corporate trustee model of governance. Dalriada, one of the largest professional trustee firms in the UK, are now acting as Professional Corporate Sole Trustee (PCST) for the Scheme. Being governed by a PCST is better suited to an ever-changing and more highly regulated pension landscape.

The asset recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the defined benefit pension plan is the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period. The defined benefit obligation is calculated bi-annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. Future cash flows of the Scheme which are subject to inflation are calculated using a CPI inflation assumption for the majority of the cash flows, with a small proportion of cash flows linked to RPI. IAS 19 requires the inflation assumptions to be market-based assumptions, as opposed to being based on economic forecasts.

The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated, inflated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligation.

Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.

# Triennial funding valuation

The most recent completed full actuarial valuation of the Scheme was undertaken as at 30 June 2023 and resulted in an actuarially assessed surplus of £11.4m (relative to the technical provisions i.e. the level of assets agreed by the Trustee and the Company as being appropriate to meet member benefits, assuming the Scheme continues as a going concern). The next triennial valuation will be performed as at 30 June 2026. Under the new schedule of contributions agreed at the conclusion of the recent triennial valuation, and reflecting the Scheme being in surplus, there are no employer contributions required. Separately to the schedule of contributions the Company does have a cash commitment to the Scheme in respect of an asset-backed funding arrangement established in 2012, see QinetiQ Pension Funding Partnership below.

# QinetiQ's Pension Funding Partnership (PFP) structure

On 26 March 2012 QinetiQ established the QinetiQ PFP Limited Partnership (the 'Partnership') with the Scheme. Under this arrangement, properties to the capitalised value of £32.3m were transferred to the Partnership. The transfers were effected through a 20-year sale and leaseback agreement. The Scheme's interest in the Partnership entitles it to annual distributions from 2012. The annual distribution in the year to 31 March 2025 will be £3.5m, which will increase thereafter, indexed by reference to CPI, until 2032.

The Partnership is controlled by QinetiQ and its results are consolidated by the Group. Under IAS 19, the interest held by the Scheme in the Partnership does not qualify as a plan asset for the purposes of the Group's consolidated financial statements and is, therefore, not included within the fair value of plan assets. As a result, the Group's consolidated financial statements are unchanged by the Partnership. In addition, the value of the property transferred to the Partnership and leased back to QinetiQ remains on the balance sheet. QinetiQ retains the operational flexibility to substitute properties of equivalent value within the Partnership and has the option to settle outstanding amounts due under the interest before 2032 if it so chooses.

# Other UK schemes

In the UK the Group has a small number of employees for whom benefits are secured through the Prudential Platinum Scheme ('PPS'). The PPS scheme is always fully funded and has a very small surplus at year end. QinetiQ also offers employees access to a Group Self Invested Personal Pension Plan, but no Company contributions are paid to this arrangement.

# Defined benefit pension plan ('Scheme') net pension asset

The Scheme is in a net asset position with the market value of assets in excess of the present value of Scheme liabilities. These have the values set out below as at 31 March of each year end.

<table><tr><td>All figures in £ million</td><td>31 March2024</td><td>31 March2023</td></tr><tr><td>Total market value of assets – see table below for analysis by category of asset</td><td>1,316.2</td><td>1,355.2</td></tr><tr><td>Present value of Scheme liabilities</td><td>(1,297.8)</td><td>(1,235.4)</td></tr><tr><td>Net pension asset before deferred tax</td><td>18.4</td><td>119.8</td></tr><tr><td>Deferred tax liability</td><td>(9.6)</td><td>(35.4)</td></tr><tr><td>Net pension asset after deferred tax</td><td>8.8</td><td>84.4</td></tr></table>

The balance sheet net pension asset is a snapshot view which can be significantly influenced by short-term market factors. The calculation of the net asset depends on factors which are beyond the control of the Group – principally the value of the various categories of assets in which the Scheme has invested and long-term interest rates and inflation rates used to value the Scheme's liabilities. This is particularly pertinent at times when markets are volatile. Sensitivities and risks are described on page 175.

The key driver for the decrease in the net pension asset since the March 2023 year end was an experience loss following recalibration to the recently completed 30 June 2023 triennial valuation.

1 Primarily private market debt investments.  
2 Includes unlisted corporate bonds with commercial property held as security.  
3 The fair value of equity derivative financial instruments is £15.8m. This reflects the marked to market valuation of all equity derivatives held by the Scheme. The exposure to equities is significantly greater than the fair value, with a notional value of the equity derivative financial instruments of £171.7m as at 31 March 2024 and a total economic exposure value of £187.5m.  
The fair value of corporate credit derivative financial instruments is £2.2m. This is in respect of various credit default swap financial instruments held by the Scheme. These provide significantly greater exposure to corporate bonds. The notional value of these financial instruments was £100.1m as at 31 March 2024, with a total economic exposure value of £102.3m.  
5 The fair value of other derivative financial instruments is £1.6m. This is in respect of various foreign exchange contracts held by the Scheme. The exposure to foreign exchange risk is significantly greater than the £1.6m marked to market value of the forward contracts. The notional value of these financial instruments was £210.0m as at 31 March 2024, with a total economic exposure value of £211.6m.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

For the year ended 31 March

# 28. Post-retirement benefits (continued)

The Scheme's assets do not include any of the Group's own transferable financial instruments, property occupied by, or other assets used by the Group. During the year the pension fund took out a loan of £125m to facilitate an increase in the level of hedging in place. The loan will be repaid in tranches by FY27 when the investments mature.

The insurance policies obtained by the pension scheme can only be used to pay or fund employee benefits under the Company's defined benefit plan. They are not available to the Company's own creditors and cannot be paid to another entity. These are the requirements of IAS 19 paragraph 7 and hence our determination is that the insurance policies are qualifying insurance policies and require classification as a plan asset. The policies were issued by insurers that are not a related party.

Per the Scheme rules the Company has an unconditional right to a refund of any surplus, assuming gradual settlement of all liabilities over time. Such surplus may arise on cessation of the Scheme in the context of IFRIC 14 paragraphs 11(b) and 12 and therefore the full net pension asset can be recognised on the Group's balance sheet and the Group's minimum funding commitments to the Scheme do not give rise to an additional balance sheet liability.

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">All figures in £ million</td><td colspan="2">31 March 2024</td><td colspan="2">31 March 2023</td></tr><tr><td>Insured members</td><td>Uninsured members</td><td>Insured members</td><td>Uninsured members</td></tr><tr><td>Discount rate applied to Scheme liabilities</td><td>4.80%</td><td>4.80%</td><td>4.80%</td><td>4.65%</td></tr><tr><td>CPI inflation assumption</td><td>2.55%</td><td>2.60%</td><td>2.55%</td><td>2.70%</td></tr><tr><td>Net rate (discount rate less inflation)</td><td>2.25%</td><td>2.20%</td><td>2.25%</td><td>1.95%</td></tr><tr><td>Assumed life expectancies in years:</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>At 60 for males currently aged 40</td><td>n/a</td><td>28.3</td><td>n/a</td><td>27.9</td></tr><tr><td>At 60 for females currently aged 40</td><td>n/a</td><td>30.7</td><td>n/a</td><td>30.3</td></tr><tr><td>At 60 for males currently aged 60</td><td>n/a</td><td>26.7</td><td>n/a</td><td>26.2</td></tr><tr><td>At 60 for females currently aged 60</td><td>n/a</td><td>29.1</td><td>n/a</td><td>28.2</td></tr><tr><td>At 65 for males currently aged 65</td><td>22.3</td><td>n/a</td><td>21.6</td><td>n/a</td></tr><tr><td>At 65 for females currently aged 65</td><td>24.8</td><td>n/a</td><td>23.3</td><td>n/a</td></tr></table>

The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, because of the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice. It is important to note that these assumptions are long term and, in the case of the discount rate and the inflation rate, are measured by reference to external market indicators.

The discount rate is based on observable yields on corporate bonds but there is no direct, observable market rate for CPI. A 'market approach' to deriving CPI involves adjusting a market-based RPI rate downward by an 'inflation risk premium' and an RPI-CPI adjustment factor (determined from relevant market yield curves). This market-based approach is required by IAS 19 and results in a CPI inflation rate significantly in excess of the Bank of England long term target and also in excess of a consensus view of CPI (based on surveys of economists). However, adopting an economic consensus approach to setting CPI inflation is not acceptable under accounting standards.

The mortality assumptions for both the current and prior year were based on the S3 Normal Lives base tables, with various scaling factors based on sex and status. Allowance was made for improvements in mortality in line with CMI_2022 core projections (31 March 2023: CMI_2021 projections) and a long-term rate of improvement of  $1.25\%$  per annum (31 March 2023:  $1.25\%$ ).

The funding of the Scheme is based on long-term trends and assumptions relating to market growth, as advised by qualified actuaries and investment advisors. The Scheme 'duration', calculated using discounted future cash flows, is an indicator of the weighted-average time until benefits are paid and is approximately 15 years for non-insured liabilities and 10 years for insured liabilities. The average duration for the Scheme as a whole is 13 years.

The sensitivity of the Scheme liabilities to each of the key assumptions is shown in the following table.

Sensitivity analysis of the principal assumptions  

<table><tr><td>Assumption</td><td>Indicative impact on Scheme assets</td><td>Indicative impact on Scheme liabilities</td><td>Indicative impact on net pension asset</td></tr><tr><td>Decrease discount rate by 0.25%</td><td>Increase by £12.6m</td><td>Increase by £42.5m</td><td>Decrease by £29.9m</td></tr><tr><td>Increase rate of inflation by 0.25%</td><td>Increase by £12.3m</td><td>Increase by £41.6m</td><td>Decrease by £29.3m</td></tr><tr><td>Increase life expectancy by one year</td><td>Increase by £13.8m</td><td>Increase by £34.4m</td><td>Decrease by £20.6m</td></tr></table>

The impact of movements in Scheme liabilities will, to an extent, be offset by movements in the value of Scheme assets as the Scheme has assets invested in a Liability Driven Investment portfolio. As at 31 March 2023 this portfolio hedged against approximately  $65\%$  of the interest rate risk and also  $80\%$  of the inflation rate risk, as measured on the Trustees' gilt-funded basis. During the current financial year, the hedges have been increased to cover approximately  $80\%$  of the interest rate risk and  $85\%$  of the inflation rate risk as at 31 March 2024, as measured on the Trustees' gilt-funded basis.

The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (projected unit credit method) has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the statement of financial position. The methods and types of assumption did not change.

In addition to the sensitivity of the liability side of the net pension asset (which will impact the value of the net pension asset) the net pension asset is also exposed to significant variation due to changes in the fair value of Scheme assets. A specific sensitivity on assets has not been included in the above table but any change in valuation of assets flows straight through to the value of the net pension asset e.g. if equities fall by £10m then the net pension asset reduces by £10m. The values of unquoted assets assume that an available buyer is willing to purchase those assets at that value. For the Group's portfolio of assets, the unquoted alternative bonds of £253.8m; the unquoted corporate bonds of £120.6m and the unquoted equities of £21.8m are the assets with most uncertainty as to valuation as at 31 March 2024.

The accounting assumptions noted are used to calculate the year end net pension asset in accordance with the relevant accounting standard, IAS 19 (revised) 'Employee Benefits'. Changes in these assumptions have no impact on the Group's cash payments into the Scheme. The payments into the Scheme are reassessed after every triennial valuation. The triennial valuations are calculated on a funding basis and use a different set of assumptions, as agreed with the pension Trustees. The key assumption that varies between the two methods of valuation is the discount rate. The funding basis valuation uses the risk-free rate from UK gilts as the base for calculating the discount rate, whilst the IAS 19 accounting basis valuation uses corporate bond yields as the base.

# Risks

Through its defined benefit pension plan, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:

<table><tr><td>Volatility in market conditions</td><td>Results under IAS 19 can change dramatically depending on market conditions. The present value of Scheme liabilities is linked to yields on corporate bonds, while many of the assets of the Scheme are invested in various forms of assets subject to fluctuating valuations. Changing markets in conjunction with discount rate volatility will lead to volatility in the net pension asset on the Group&#x27;s balance sheet and in other comprehensive income. To a lesser extent this will also lead to volatility in the IAS 19 pension net finance income in the Group&#x27;s income statement.</td></tr><tr><td>Choice of accounting assumptions</td><td>The calculation of the present value of Scheme liabilities involves projecting future cash flows from the Scheme many years into the future. This means that the assumptions used can have a material impact on the balance sheet position and profit and loss charge. In practice future experience within the Scheme may not be in line with the assumptions adopted. For example, members could live longer than foreseen or inflation could be higher or lower than allowed for in the calculation of the liabilities.</td></tr></table>

# Rights attaching to the Special Share

QinetiQ carries out activities which are important to UK defence and security interests. To protect these interests in the context of the ongoing commercial relationship between the MOD and QinetiQ, and to promote and reinforce the Compliance Principles, the MOD holds a Special Share in QinetiQ. QinetiQ obtained MOD consent to changes in its Special Shareholder rights, which were approved by shareholders at the 2012 AGM. The changes to the Special Share were disclosed in the 2012 Annual Report. Subsequent to the changes approved at the 2012 AGM the Special Share confers certain rights on the holder:

a) to require the Group to implement and maintain the Compliance System (as defined in the Articles of Association) so as to make at all times effective its and each member of QinetiQ Controlled Group's application of the Compliance Principles, in a manner acceptable to the Special Shareholder  
b) to refer matters to the Board for its consideration in relation to the application of the Compliance Principles  
c) to require the Board to obtain Special Shareholder's consent:

i) if at any time when the chairman is not a British citizen, it is proposed to appoint any person to the office of chief executive, who is not a British citizen  
ii) if at any time when the chief executive is not a British citizen, it is proposed to appoint any person to the office of chairman, who is not a British citizen  
d) to require the Board to take action to rectify any omission in the application of the Compliance Principles, if the Special Shareholder is of the opinion that such steps are necessary to protect the defence or security interests of the United Kingdom  
e) to demand a poll at any of QinetiQ's meetings (even though it may have no voting rights except those specifically set out in the Articles).

The Special Shareholder has an option to purchase defined Strategic Assets of the Group in certain circumstances. The Special Shareholder has, inter alia, the right to purchase any Strategic Assets which the Group wishes to sell. Strategic Assets are normally testing and research facilities (see note 31 for further details).

The Special Share may only be issued to, held by and transferred to HM Government (or as it directs). At any time the Special Shareholder may require QinetiQ to redeem the Special Share at par. If QinetiQ is wound up the Special Shareholder will be entitled to be repaid the capital paid up on the Special Share before other shareholders receive any payment. The Special Shareholder has no other right to share in the capital or profits of QinetiQ and the Special Shareholder must give consent to a general meeting held on short notice.

The Special Share entitles the Special Shareholder to require certain persons who hold (together with any person acting in concert with them) a material interest in QinetiQ to dispose of some or all of their ordinary shares in certain prescribed circumstances on the grounds of national security or conflict of interest. The Directors must register any transfer of the Special Share within seven days.

# Other reserves

The translation reserve includes the cumulative foreign exchange difference arising on translation. Movements on hedging instruments, where the hedge is effective, are recorded in the hedge reserve until the hedge ceases.

The capital redemption reserve, which was created following the redemption of preference share capital and the bonus issue of shares, cannot be distributed.

# Own shares

Own shares represent shares in the Company that are held by independent trusts and include treasury shares and shares held by the employee share ownership plan. Included in retained earnings at 31 March 2024 are 2,767,125 shares (2023: 4,208,899 shares).

# 30. Share-based payments

The Group operates a number of share-based payment plans for employees. The total share-based payment expense in the year was £10.2m, all relating to equity-settled schemes (FY23: £7.9m, all relating to equity-settled schemes). The share-based payment charged to equity is £8.8m consisting of the £10.2m charge to the income statement offset by a £0.6m charge to equity in respect of dividends accruing on unvested awards and £0.8m of cash payments relating to the Bonus Banking Plan.

# Valuation of share-based awards

Share-based awards that vest based on non-market performance conditions have been valued at the share price at grant date and are equity-settled.

# Group Share Incentive Plan (SIP)

Under the QinetiQ SIP the Group offers UK employees the opportunity of purchasing up to £150 worth of shares a month at the prevailing market rate. The Group will make a matching share award of a third of the employee's payment. The Group's matching shares may be forfeited if the employee ceases to be employed by QinetiQ within three years of the award of the shares. There is no exercise price for these SIP awards.

The BBP is a remuneration scheme that runs in three-year performance cycles, with each cycle vesting over a four-year period. Under the BBP a contribution will be made by the Company into the participant's Plan account following the end of each Plan year.  $50\%$  of the value of a participant's Plan account will be paid out annually for three years with  $100\%$  of the residual value paid out at the end of year four.  $50\%$  of the unpaid balance of a participant's bonus account will be at risk of forfeiture. Refer to the Directors' Remuneration Report for further details.

At 31 March 2024 the awards had an average remaining life of 0.7 years (2023: 1.7 years). There is no exercise price for these awards. The fair value of the awards at 31 March 2024 was £3.67 (2023: £3.34) being the Group's 30 day average on 31 March. The weighted average share price at date of exercise was nil (2023: £3.68). Of the awards outstanding at the end of the year nil were exercisable.

# Deferred Share Plan (DSP)

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

For the year ended 31 March

# 30. Share-based payments (continued)

The number of awards is dependent on the Group's performance during the year (specifically with respect to the Group revenue growth). This is provisionally quantified at year end based on Group performance and also the number of eligible employees in employment as at 31 March. Actual awards are made in the following June and the final number awarded will be slightly different to the number provisionally calculated.

Awards are then subject to a three-year vesting period and a further two-year holding period. Vesting of the awards is contingent upon Group operating profit in the year prior to vesting being maintained at the level reported during the year prior to award. Refer to the Directors' Remuneration Report for further details.

At 31 March 2024 the awards had an average remaining life of 1.3 years (2023: 2.4 years). There is no exercise price for these awards. The weighted average share price at date of exercise was nil (2023: £3.64). Of the awards outstanding at the end of the year nil were exercisable.

# Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)

During the year the Group granted LTIP awards to replace the DSP awards.

<table><tr><td></td><td>FY24

At 31 March 2024 the awards had an average remaining life of 2.5 years. There is no exercise price for these awards. The weighted average fair value of grants made during the year was £3.22. The weighted average share price at date of exercise was nil. Of the options outstanding at the end of the year nil were exercisable.

# Restricted share plan (RSP)

RSP is a share award made to senior executives on a discretionary basis. For example, to offset a new senior executive joiner on a loss of stock options from their previous employer and it is a fixed number of shares. During the year the Group granted RSP awards to certain senior executives in the UK and US.

The weighted average fair value of grants made during the year was £3.28 (2023: £3.41). The weighted average share price at date of exercise was £3.12 (2023: £3.17). Of the options outstanding at the end of the year nil were exercisable (2023: nil).

# Value Creation Plan (VCP)

VCP is a share award made on a discretionary basis with unique performance conditions. In FY23, the Group granted awards under a Value Creation Plan to certain senior executives in the US. During the current year, all the awards were forfeited as the performance conditions were not met.

<table><tr><td></td><td>FY24

At 31 March 2024 the awards had an average remaining life of nil year (2023: 0.2 years). There is no exercise price for these awards. The weighted average fair value of grants made during the year was £nil (2023: nil).

# High Performance Share Award (HPSA)

In a prior year, as one of eight initial measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the senior leaders agreed to, on average, a temporary base salary reduction of  $15\%$ . To both recognise the senior leaders for their sacrifice and to incentivise them to lead the Group through the crisis as quickly and effectively as possible, the Group adopted a new award called High Performance Share Award (HPSA). The HPSA was awarded in November 2020 as a 'Thank Q' to senior leaders for their sacrifice and enormous efforts to lead their teams out of unprecedented crisis. The fair value of QinetiQ shares on grant date was £2.70 and the awards vest in June 2023. At 31 March 2024 the awards had an average remaining life of nil year (2023: 0.3 years). The weighted average share price at date of exercise was £3.54 (2023: nil).

# 31. Transactions with the Ministry of Defence (MOD)

The MOD continues to own its Special Share in QinetiQ which conveys certain rights as set out in note 29. Transactions between the Group and the MOD are disclosed as follows:

# Freehold land and buildings and surplus properties

Under the terms of the Group's acquisition of part of the business and certain assets of DERA from the MOD on 1 July 2001, the MOD retained certain rights in respect of the freehold land and buildings transferred.

# Restrictions on transfer of title

The title deeds of those properties with strategic assets (see below) include a clause that prevents their transfer without the approval of the MOD. The MOD also has the right to purchase any strategic assets in certain circumstances.

# MOD's generic compliance regime

Adherence to the generic compliance system is monitored by the Risk & Security Committee. Refer to the Committee's report within the Corporate Governance Statement on page 108.

# Strategic assets

Under the Principal Agreement with the MOD, the QinetiQ controlled Group is not permitted without the written consent of the MOD, to:

i) dispose of or destroy all or any part of a strategic asset; or  
ii) voluntarily undertake any closure of, or cease to provide a strategic capability by means of, all or any part of a strategic asset.

The net book value of assets identified as being strategic assets as at 31 March 2024 was £2.1m (2023: £3.0m).

# Long Term Partnering Agreement

On 27 February 2003 QinetiQ Limited entered into a Long Term Partnering Agreement (LTPA) to provide test and evaluation (T&E) facilities and training support services to the MOD. This is a 25-year contract with a total revenue value of up to £5.6bn, dependent on the level of usage by the MOD, under which QinetiQ Limited is committed to providing T&E services with increasing efficiencies through cost saving and innovative service delivery. Following an amendment to the LTPA contract on 5 April 2019 this contract is no longer subject to re-pricing every five years and is now contracted at a fixed price to 31 March 2028.

# Other contracts with MOD

The LTPA is the most significant contract QinetiQ has with the MOD. In total approximately  $57\%$  (FY23:  $57\%$ ) of the Group's revenue comes directly from contracts with the MOD.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

For the year ended 31 March

# 32. Contingent liabilities and assets

Subsidiary undertakings within the Group have given unsecured guarantees of £56.7m at 31 March 2024 (2023: £33.6m) in the ordinary course of business, typically in respect of performance bonds and rental guarantees.

The Company has on occasion been required to take legal action to protect its intellectual property rights, to enforce commercial contracts or otherwise and similarly to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties, including in respect of environmental and regulatory issues. Provisions are made for the expected costs associated with such matters, based on past experience of similar items and other known factors, taking into account professional advice received, and represent management's best estimate of the likely outcome. The timing of utilisation of these provisions is uncertain pending the outcome of various court proceedings, ongoing investigations and negotiations. However, no provision is made for proceedings which have been or might be brought by other parties unless management, taking into account professional advice received, assesses that it is more likely than not that such proceedings may be successful. Contingent liabilities associated with such proceedings have been identified but the Directors are of the opinion that any associated claims that might be brought can be resisted successfully and therefore the possibility of any outflow in settlement is assessed as remote.

# 33. Capital commitments

The Group had the following capital commitments for which no provision has been made:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">All figures in £ million</td><td>31 March</td><td>31 March</td></tr><tr><td>2024</td><td>2023</td></tr><tr><td>Total contracted</td><td>57.8</td><td>43.4</td></tr></table>

Capital commitments at 31 March 2024 include £49.7m (2023: £21.2m) in relation to property, plant and equipment that will be wholly funded by a third-party customer under long-term contract arrangements. These primarily relate to investments under the LTPA contract.

# 34. Related parties

During the year ended 31 March 2024 there were sales to joint ventures of £3.1m (FY23: £0.4m). At the year-end there were outstanding receivables from joint ventures of £2.8m (FY23: £0.5m).

# 35. Subsidiaries and other related undertakings

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

For the year ended 31 March

# 36. Basis of preparation and material accounting policies

QinetiQ Group plc ('the Company') is a public limited company, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled in England, United Kingdom. The consolidated financial statements of the Group comprise statements for the Company and its subsidiaries, together referred to as 'the Group'.

# Accounting policies

The following accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented in dealing with items that are considered material in relation to the Group's financial statements. In the income statement, the Group presents 'specific adjusting items' separately. In the judgement of the Directors, for the reader to obtain a proper understanding of business performance, specific adjusting items need to be disclosed separately. Underlying measures of performance exclude specific adjusting items.

# Specific adjusting items

Specific adjusting items include the following:

<table><tr><td>Item</td><td>Distorting due to irregular nature year on year</td><td>Distorting due to fluctuating nature (size and sign)</td><td>Does not reflect in-year operational performance of continuing business</td></tr><tr><td>Amortisation of intangible assets arising from acquisitions</td><td></td><td></td><td>✓</td></tr><tr><td>Pension net finance income</td><td></td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td></tr><tr><td>Gains/losses on disposal of businesses, property and investments</td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td></tr><tr><td>Transaction, integration and on-off remuneration costs in respect of business acquisitions and disposals</td><td>✓</td><td></td><td>✓</td></tr><tr><td>Impairment of property and goodwill</td><td>✓</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>One-off period of digital investment</td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td></tr><tr><td>Costs of group-wide restructuring programmes</td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>The tax impact of the above</td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td></tr><tr><td>Other significant non-recurring tax and RDEC movements</td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td></tr></table>

The financial impact of each item is reported in note 4 to these financial statements.

These 'specific adjusting items' are of a 'non-operational' nature and do not include all significant, irregular items that are of an operational nature, for example contract risk provisions and gains/losses on disposal of plant and equipment.

# Basis of preparation

The Group's financial statements, approved by the Directors, have been prepared on a going concern basis as discussed in the Strategic Report on page 64 in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards and with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting under those standards. The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP (FRS 101); these are presented on page 193. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for certain financial assets and liabilities (such as derivative financial instruments) measures at fair value. The Group's reporting currency is Sterling and unless otherwise stated the financial statements are rounded to the nearest £100,000.

# Basis of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings to 31 March 2024. The purchase method of accounting has been adopted. Those subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the period are included in the consolidated income statement from the date control is obtained to the date that control is lost (usually on acquisition and disposal respectively). An investor controls an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. This is the IFRS 10 definition of 'control'.

The Group comprises certain entities that are operated within the terms of a Special Security Arrangement ('SSA'). Details of the SSA and QinetiQ's management of US subsidiaries are set out in the Corporate Governance section of this Annual Report (on page 88). IFRS 10 is the accounting standard applicable in respect of consolidation of entities. This does not specifically deal with SSA's. However, having considered the terms of the SSA, the Directors consider that the Group meets the requirements of IFRS 10 in respect of control over such affected entities and, therefore, consolidates these entities in the consolidated accounts. The impact of this specific judgement is full consolidation as opposed to treatment as a  $100\%$  associated undertaking.

An associate is an undertaking over which the Group exercises significant influence, usually from  $20\% - 50\%$  of the equity voting rights, in respect of financial and operating policy. A joint venture is an undertaking over which the Group exercises joint control. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method from the date of acquisition to the date of disposal. The Group's investments in Joint ventures are held at cost including goodwill on acquisition and any post-acquisition changes in the Group's share of the net assets of the joint venture less any impairment to the recoverable amount. Where a joint venture has net liabilities, full provision is made for the Group's share of liabilities where there is a constructive or legal obligation to provide additional funding to the joint venture.

The financial statements of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are adjusted where necessary to ensure compliance with Group accounting policies.

# Consideration of climate change

In preparing the financial statements, the Board have considered the impact to the organisation and its activities of climate change, particularly those risks highlighted on page 60 in line with the recommendations by the Task Force for Climate-related Disclosures (TCFD). The Board recognises its responsibilities for oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities. The QinetiQ Leadership Team support the Board through the implementation of a strategic led approach to monitor, assess and address climate transition risks and opportunities, which includes refining our capability to quantify, forecast and model financial statement impacts due to climate change.

Specific aspects of the financial statements that could potentially be impacted by climate change are the carrying value and useful economic lives of tangible assets and goodwill, future capability development and the financial performance of customer contracts.

Whilst the Group will likely be impacted by climate change in the future, the impacts on the financial statements as at 31 March 2024 are not considered to be material.

# Material accounting policies

# Revenue from contracts with customers

The Group recognises revenue primarily from the following major sources:

- Through combining world-leading expertise with unique facilities to provide technical assurance, test and evaluation and training services underpinned by long-term contracts;  
- Through delivering innovative solutions and products to meet customer requirements by undertaking contract-funded research and development, developing intellectual property and by internal funding with potential for new revenue streams.

Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Group recognises revenue when it transfers control of a product or service to a customer. The Group's revenue contracts are accounted for under IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers' taking into account the requirement to distinguish between the various performance obligations within a contract and treating these separately. The Group's methodology applies IFRS 15 on a contract-by-contract basis which includes considerations for contract modifications, variable consideration, the determination of distinct performance obligations, determination of agency and principal relationships and licences.

# Service contracts

The Group's long-term service contracts are generally 'test and evaluation' or advice-based contracts where control of the service is transferred over a period of time as the Group performs. At contract inception the Group undertakes an assessment to determine how many distinct performance obligations exists within a contract. As part of the assessment the Group obtains an understanding of the overall deliverable to the customer through discussions with business units and project leads. Each individual deliverable in the contract is then assessed to determine if it is an input into the overall deliverable, and therefore part of a single performance obligation, or if it is a stand-alone separable deliverable with its own transaction price and therefore a distinct performance obligation in its own right. Each distinct performance obligation identified within a contract is accounted for separately.

Certain service contracts have a similar pattern of transfer of control to the customer where each year is effectively the same from a performance obligation perspective. The Group has applied the series guidance as permitted within the Standard to these contracts and accounts for these as a series of distinct service performance obligations satisfied annually over the contract term.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

For the year ended 31 March

# 36. Basis of preparation and material accounting policies (continued)

The transaction price for a contract is determined at contract inception based on a fixed-margin applied to the total forecast costs to complete the deliverable. Some long-term contracts include an excess profit clause which is a variable consideration factor that could impact the transaction price. Excess profits are estimated at contract inception and at the end of each reporting period to ensure that the transaction price is not under or over stated. Any required adjustment will be made against the transaction price in the period in which it occurred. The Group does not offer any right of return or refunds which could impact transaction price at inception.

Certain contracts attract bonuses and/or penalties which are variable and will have an impact on transaction price at contract inception. The Group assesses variable consideration in relation to bonuses and penalties at contract inception using the most-likely method and this forms part of the transaction price and recognised over time as costs are incurred. The Group only includes bonuses and penalties into the transaction price to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur in future periods. Historical evidence and experience shows that even where a reduction has been required, that reduction has been immaterial to the Group.

The transaction price is allocated between each distinct performance obligation identified in a contract based on the stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation. Each performance obligation will be costed and the transaction price will be cost plus margin. This amount would be the stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation if contracted with a customer separately.

Long-term service contracts allow for modifications to the original order. If a contract modification is determined to be distinct and the price of the contract increases by an amount of consideration that reflects the entity's stand-alone selling prices for the additional promised goods or services, the Group accounts for this as a separate contract. If a contract modification is not distinct, the Group accounts for this as if it were part of the existing contract. A cumulative catch-up adjustment to revenue is then recognised to disclose the effect that the contract modification has on the transaction price and the Group's measure of progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation.

Long-term service contracts also sometimes allow for extensions to the original order. A contract extension is determined to include either additional goods or services or no additional goods or service. If a contract extension with additional goods or services is determined to be distinct and the price of the contract increases by an amount of consideration that reflects the entity's stand-alone selling prices for the additional promised goods or services, the Group accounts for this as a separate performance obligation.

If a contract extension with additional goods or services is not distinct, the Group accounts for this as if it were part of the existing contract. A cumulative catch-up adjustment to revenue is then recognised to disclose the effect that the contract extension has on the transaction price and the Group's measure of progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation.

When the outcome of a distinct performance obligation in delivering services can be reliably estimated, revenue associated with the performance obligation is recognised over time using the input method. The input method recognises revenue over time on the basis of costs incurred to date to the satisfaction of a performance obligation relative to the total forecast costs to complete the performance obligation. The Group has determined the input method to be appropriate as it best depicts the Group's performance in transferring control of the service to the customer as it incurs costs on a particular contract.

No profit is recognised on contracts until the outcome of the contract can be reliably estimated. When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised immediately as an expense.

# Goods sold

The Group recognises revenue on the sale of products at a point in time once control has been transferred to the customer. Control is generally transferred to customers on delivery of products or when the customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the product. Payment is typically due within 30 days of invoice (within the UK) and customers typically do not have a right of return or refund. The transaction price for sale of products is agreed at contract inception. When the Group develops a bespoke product for a customer with no alternative use to the Group, revenue is recognised over time using the input method.

# Licence revenue

Licence revenue is attributed to either 'right to use' or 'right to access' licences. 'Right to use' licence revenue is recognised at a point in time when the Group sells a licence to a customer and does not undertake significant further activities or involvement in developing the licence after the sale. 'Right to access' licence revenue is recognised over time when the Group maintains a significant level of involvement in developing and enhancing the licence after the sale. The level of involvement goes beyond general support, bug-fixing and upgrades which generally only maintain the current operating level. The transaction price for intellectual property is agreed at contract inception. The Group does not offer any right of return or refunds which could impact transaction price at inception.

The Group recognises licence revenue through the supply of a range of security, messaging and connectivity software products. A licence fee is paid for each computer that uses the software and the customer can also purchase a support service contract for a fixed period. The sale of these types of licences is recognised at a point in time as a distinct performance obligation because the Group does not undertake any further activities in developing the licence after the sale. The support service contract is recognised over time as a separate performance obligation as this is an optional extra and is not integral into the functionality of the licence. The support service contract offers general support and maintenance of the licence to the customer over a fixed period.

# Contract assets

Contract assets represent revenue recognised in excess of amounts invoiced. Revenue is recognised on service contracts by using a 'percentage complete' method, applying the proportion of contract costs incurred for work performed to date relative to the estimated total contract cost, after making suitable allowances for technical and other risks related to performance milestones yet to be achieved, and applying that proportion to total contract price. Payment for service contracts are not always due from the customer until certain milestones have been reached and, therefore, a contract asset is recognised over the period in which the services are performed representing the Group's right to consideration for services performed to date, to the extent that the customer has not yet been invoiced for those services.

# Contract liabilities

The Group, on occasion, bills customers in advance of performing certain types of work which results in the Group recognising contract liabilities. Once the work has been performed these amounts will be reduced and recognised as revenue. For sale of goods, revenue is recognised in the income statement when control of the goods has been transferred to the customer; being at the point when the goods are delivered. Any transaction price received by the Group prior to that point is recognised as a contract liability.

# Principal-agent arrangements

The Group enters into certain arrangements which involve a consortium of service providers. The Group acts as a 'Prime' contractor in certain contracts with customers and utilises sub-contractors to undertake the work. Under these contracts the Group is considered to be primarily responsible for fulfilling the service to the customer. The Group performs a technical assessment of the work before it is delivered to the customer and is responsible for quality and performance of the sub-contractor. As such the Group is considered to be the principal to the arrangement with the customer and includes sub-contractor costs within revenue. However, where the Group is merely acting as an agent of a sub-contractor then no revenue is recognised in respect of sub-contractor costs.

All consortium arrangements are assessed by the Group to determine if it is the principal or agent.

# Contract bidding costs

The Group recognises the 'incremental costs of obtaining a contract' with a customer as an asset if the Group expects to recover those costs. The 'incremental costs of obtaining a contract' are those costs that the Group incurs to obtain a contract with a customer that it would not have incurred if the contract had not been won. Costs to obtain a contract that would have been incurred regardless of whether the contract was won or lost shall be recognised as an expense when incurred, unless those costs are explicitly chargeable to the customer.

# Segmental information

Segmental information is presented according to the Group's internal management reporting structure and the markets in which it operates. Segmental results represent the contribution of the different segments to the profit of the Group. Corporate expenses are allocated to the corresponding segments. Unallocated items mainly comprise Research and Development Expenditure Credits (RDEC) and specific adjusting items. Specific adjusting items are referred to in note 4. Segmental assets and liabilities information is not regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker.

# Research and development expenditure

Research and development (R&D) costs incurred in respect of specific contracts placed by customers are recognised within operating costs and revenue is recognised in respect of the R&D services performed. Internally funded development expenditure is capitalised in the balance sheet where there is a clearly defined project, the expenditures are separately identifiable, the project is technically and commercially feasible, all costs are recoverable by future revenue and the resources are committed to complete the project. Such capitalised costs are amortised over the forecast period of sales resulting from the development. All other R&D costs are expensed to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred. If the research phase cannot be clearly distinguished from the development phase, the respective project-related costs are treated as if they were incurred in the research phase only and expensed.

# Borrowings and financing

The Group has a term loan and access to a revolving credit facility with its relationship banks. Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption amount is recognised in profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.

Borrowings are removed from the balance sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability that has been extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in profit or loss as other income or finance costs.

Borrowings are classified as non-current liabilities where the group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period.

Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw-down occurs. The Group pays in advance finance costs in relation to the multi-currency facility which are recognised as a deferred finance cost asset and amortised over the period of the facility, where it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. Costs of letters of credit are also charged to finance expense.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

For the year ended 31 March

# 36. Basis of preparation and material accounting policies (continued)

Exchange differences on financial assets and liabilities and the income or expense from interest hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement are included within finance income and finance expense. Financing also includes the net finance income or expense in respect of defined benefit pension schemes.

# Taxation

The income tax expense or credit for the period is the tax payable on the current period's taxable income, based on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction, adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences and to unused tax losses. The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period in the countries where the company and its subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income.

Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation and considers whether it is probable that a taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment. The Group measures its tax balances either based on the most likely amount or the expected value, depending on which method provides a better prediction of the resolution of the uncertainty.

Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred income tax is also not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.

Deferred tax assets are recognised only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are not recognised for temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax bases of investments in foreign operations where the company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and where the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities are offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

The Group has applied the temporary exemption issued by the International Accounting Standards Board from the accounting for deferred taxes under IAS12 and neither recognises nor discloses information about deferred taxes related to OECD's Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (Pillar Two) income taxes.

Current and deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

Research and Development Expenditure Credits (RDEC) are recognised within other operating income.

# Non-current assets held for sale

Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered primarily through a sales transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and expected to be completed within a year of the balance sheet date. The assets should be available for immediate sale in their present condition and actively marketed at a price that is reasonable in relation to their current fair value.

Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Any write-down to fair value less costs to sell shall be recognised directly through profit and loss as an impairment loss. No further depreciation is charged in respect of assets classified as held for sale.

# Goodwill

Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in non-current assets. Goodwill on acquisitions of joint ventures is included in the carrying value of equity accounted investments. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill related to the entity sold.

# Intangible assets

Intangible assets arising from business combinations are recognised at fair value and are amortised over their expected useful lives, typically between 1 and 16 years. Internally generated intangible assets are recorded at cost, including labour, directly attributable costs and any third-party expenses.

The 'multi-period excess earnings' method and the 'relief-from-royalty' method are both used for fair valuing intangible assets arising from acquisitions. The multi-period excess earnings method considers the present value of net cash flows expected to be generated by customer relationships, by excluding any cash flows related to contributory assets. The relief-from-royalty method considers the discounted estimated royalty payments that are expected to be avoided as a result of the patents or trademarks being owned. Purchased intangible assets are recognised at cost less amortisation. Intangible assets are amortised over their respective useful lives on a straight-line basis as follows:

Intellectual property rights

2-10 years

Customer relationships

1-16 years

Development costs

1-5 years

Other

1-14 years

# Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less depreciation. Freehold land is not depreciated. Other tangible non-current assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives to their estimated residual value as follows:

Freehold buildings

20-25 years

Leasehold land and buildings

Shorter of useful economic life and the period of the lease

Plant and machinery

3-15 years

Motor vehicles

3-5 years

Aircraft

10-20 years

Computers

3-5 years

Office equipment

5-10 years

Assets under construction are included in property, plant and equipment on the basis of expenditure incurred at the balance sheet date. In the case of assets constructed by the Group, the value includes the cost of own work completed, including directly attributable costs and interest. The useful lives, depreciation methods and residual values applied to property, plant and equipment are reviewed annually and, if appropriate, adjusted accordingly.

# Impairment of goodwill and tangible, intangible and held for sale assets

At each reporting date the Group assesses whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If the carrying amount of any asset exceeds its recoverable amount an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement. In addition, goodwill is tested for impairment annually irrespective of any indication of impairment. If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, the respective asset or the assets in the cash-generating unit (CGU) are written down to their recoverable amounts. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. The value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or CGU calculated using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate. Impairment losses are expensed to the income statement.

# Leases

Leases - as a lessor

Lease income from operating leases where the Group is a lessor is recognised in income on a straight-line basis over the lease term (note 26). Initial direct costs incurred in obtaining an operating leases are added to the carrying amount of the underlying asset and recognised as expense over the lease term on the same basis as lease income. The respective leased assets are included in the balance sheet based on their nature.

Leases - as a lessee

The Group leases various offices, aircraft, equipment and vehicles. Rental contracts are typically made for fixed periods of 6 months to 25 years, but may have extension options as described below.

Contracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. The Group allocates the consideration in the contract to the lease and non-lease components based on their relative stand-alone process. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. The lease agreements do not impose any covenants other than the security interests in the leases assets that are held by the lessor. Leased assets may not be used as security for borrowing purposes.

Leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the Group.

Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:

fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable;  
variable lease payments based on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date;  
amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantees;  
- the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and  
- payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising that option.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

For the year ended 31 March

# 36. Basis of preparation and material accounting policies (continued)

Lease payments to be made under reasonably certain options are also included in the measurement of the liability.

The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If the rate cannot be readily determined, which is generally the case for leases in the Group, the lessee's incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions. To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Group:

where possible, uses recent third-party financing received by the individual lessee as a starting point, adjusted to reflect changes in financing conditions since third party financing was received;  
- uses a build-up approach that starts with a risk-free interest rate adjusted for credit risk for leases held by QinetiQ Plc, which does not have recent third party financing, and  
- makes adjustments specific to the lease, for example to term, country, currency and security.

The exposure by the Group to potential future increases in variable lease payments based on an index or rate, which are not included in the lease liability until they take effect is not considered material. When adjustments to lease payments based on an index or rate take effect, the lease liability is reassessed and adjusted against the right-of-use asset. Lease payments are allocated between principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:

the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability,  
- any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received;  
- any initial direct costs, and  
restoration costs.

Right-of-use assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and lease term on a straight-line basis. If the Group is reasonably certain to exercise a purchase option, the right-of-use asset is depreciated over the underlying asset's useful life. The Group does not revalue its land and buildings that are presented within property, plant and equipment and has chosen to do the same for right-of-use buildings by the Group. Payments associated with short-term leases of offices, equipment and vehicles and all leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise lease assets under £5,000.

# Lease extension and termination options

Extension and termination options are included in a number of property and equipment leases across the Group. These are used to maximise operational flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the Group's operations. The majority of extension and termination options held are exercisable only by the Group and not by the respective lessor.

# Judgements in determining the lease term

In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated).

For leases of offices and equipment, the following factors are normally the most relevant:

- if there are significant penalties to terminate (or extend), the group is typically reasonably certain to end (or not to terminate);  
- if any leasehold improvements are expected to have a significant remaining value, the Group is typically reasonably certain to extend (or not terminate);  
- Otherwise, the Group considers other factors including historical lease durations and the costs and business disruptions required to replace the leased asset.

Most extension options in office and vehicles leases have not been included in the lease liability, because the Group could replace the assets without significant cost or business disruption.

As at 31 March 2024 no (undiscounted) potential future cash outflows have been included in the lease liability for extension or termination.

The lease term is reassessed if an option is actually exercised (or not exercised) or the Group becomes obliged to exercise (or not exercise) it. The assessment of reasonable certainty is only revised if a significant event of significant change in circumstance occurs, which affects this assessment, and that is within the control of the lessee. During the current financial year, the financial effect of revising lease terms to reflect the effect of exercising extension or termination options was nil (FY23: nil) in recognised lease liabilities and right-of-use assets.

# Investments in debt and equity securities

Investments held by the Group are classified as either a current asset or as a non-current asset. These are investments in debt and equity instruments that are classified as at fair value through other comprehensive income. When these investments are derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised directly in equity is recognised in the income statement.

The fair value of quoted financial instruments is their bid price at the balance sheet date. The fair value of unquoted equity investments is based on the price of the most recent investment by the Group or a third party, if available, or derived from the present value of forecast future cash flows.

# Inventories

Inventory and work-in-progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, using the first-in-first-out cost formula. Work-in-progress and manufactured finished goods are valued at production cost. Production cost includes direct production costs and an appropriate proportion of production overheads. A provision is established when the net realisable value of any inventory item is lower than its cost. A 'market comparison' technique is used to fair value inventories acquired through a business combination. The fair value is determined based on the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and sale, and a reasonable profit margin based on the effort required to complete and sell the inventories.

# Trade and other receivables

Trade and other receivables are measured at amortised cost less any impairment losses. Amounts recoverable on contracts are included in trade and other receivables and represent revenue recognised in excess of amounts invoiced. Other receivables will also include insurance recoveries where we are virtually certain of recovery.

# Impairment of trade and other receivables

The Group applies the simplified approach when using the expected credit loss (ECL) impairment model for trade and other receivables. Under the simplified approach the Group always measures the loss allowance at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses for trade receivables. The Group measures the expected credit losses of trade and other receivables in a way that reflects a probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes, the time value of money and supportable information that is readily available at each reporting date about past events, current condition and forecasts of future economic conditions. The ECL's are updated each reporting period to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition.

# Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into a known amount of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. The Group holds various short-maturity money market funds (see note 24) across numerous financial institutions which meet the IAS 7 criteria to be classified as cash equivalents. In the cash flow statement overdraft balances are included in cash and equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents includes an element that is restricted in use (note 24).

# Current and non-current liabilities

Current liabilities include amounts due within the normal operating cycle of the Group. Deferred income, or 'contract liabilities', is included in trade and other payables and represents amounts invoiced in excess of revenue recognised. Interest-bearing current and non-current liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and then stated at amortised cost with any difference between the cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest rate basis. Costs associated with the arrangement of bank facilities or the issue of loans are held net of the associated liability presented in the balance sheet. Capitalised issue costs are released over the estimated life of the facility or instrument to which they relate using the effective interest rate method. If it becomes clear that the facility or instrument will be redeemed early, the amortisation of the issue costs will be accelerated.

# Provisions

A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event which can be reliably estimated, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Where appropriate, provisions are determined by discounting the expected cash flows at an appropriate discount rate reflecting the level of risk and the time value of money. Where an exposure is highly likely to be covered by insurance an offsetting receivable is recorded.

# Financial instruments

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group's balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument at the trade date. The de-recognition of a financial instrument takes place when the Group no longer controls the contractual right that comprise the financial instrument, when the instrument expires, or when the instrument is sold, terminated or exercised.

# Financial assets and liabilities

Financial assets are classified on the Group's balance sheet as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss. This classification is made on the basis of both the Group's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.

Financial liabilities are classified on the Group's balance sheet as subsequently measured at amortised cost except for financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss. The Group may at initial recognition irrevocably designate a financial liability as measured at fair value through profit or loss if a contract contains one or more embedded derivatives and the host is not an asset within the scope of IFRS 9, or when doing so results in more relevant information.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

For the year ended 31 March

# 36. Basis of preparation and material accounting policies (continued)

# Derivative financial instruments

Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised and thereafter held at fair value, being the market value for quoted instruments or valuation based on models and discounted cash flow calculations for unlisted instruments.

# Fair value hedging

The Group's activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Group uses foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group's Treasury Policies as approved by the Board of Directors, which provides written principles on the use of derivatives. The Group does not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes.

Certain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting. These are categorised as "fair value through profit or loss" and are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in the income statement.

The Group designates certain hedging instruments in respect of foreign currency risk as cash flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Group also documents, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item.

For the Group's cash flow hedges of highly probable forecast transactions in foreign currencies, the hedge ratio is  $100\%$ , subject to a £100k de Minimis threshold. If the underlying exposure changes over time, either due to commercial factors or timing differences, the hedging instruments will be rebalanced to ensure that the hedge ratio of  $100\%$  is maintained.

# Cash flow hedging

Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as a cash flow hedge that are regarded as highly effective are recognised in equity. The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Where a hedged item results in an asset or a liability, gains and losses previously recognised in equity are included in the cost of the asset or liability. Gains and losses previously recognised in equity are removed and recognised in the income statement at the same time as the hedged transaction.

# Foreign currencies

Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at period-end rates. Any resulting exchange differences are taken to the income statement. Gains and losses on designated forward foreign exchange hedging contracts are matched against the foreign exchange movements on the underlying transaction.

The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in its functional currency. On consolidation, assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries, associated undertakings and joint ventures, including any related goodwill, are translated to Sterling at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date. The results and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries, associated undertakings and joint ventures are translated to Sterling using the average rates of exchange during the period. Exchange adjustments arising from the re-translation of the opening net investment and the results for the period to the period-end rate are taken directly to equity and reported in the statement of comprehensive income.

# Post-retirement benefits

The Group provides both defined contribution and defined benefit pension arrangements. The liabilities of the Group arising from defined benefit obligations are determined using the projected unit credit method. Valuations for accounting purposes are carried out bi-annually. Actuarial advice is provided by external consultants. For the funded defined benefit plans, the excess or deficit of the fair value of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation are recognised as an asset or a liability respectively.

Per the Scheme rules the Company has an unconditional right to a refund of any surplus that may arise on cessation of the Scheme in the context of IFRIC 14 paragraphs 11(b) and 12 and, therefore, the full net pension asset can be recognised on the Group's balance sheet and the Group's minimum funding commitments to the Scheme do not give rise to an additional balance sheet liability.

For defined benefit plans the cost charged to the income statement consists of administrative expenses and the net interest income. There is no service cost due to the fact the plans are closed to future accrual. The net interest income is reported within finance income and the administration cost element is charged as a component of operating costs in the income statement. Actuarial gains and losses and remeasurement gains and losses are recognised immediately in full through the statement of comprehensive income. Contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement as incurred.

# Share-based payments

The Group operates share-based payment arrangements with employees. The fair value of equity-settled awards for share-based payments is determined on grant and expensed straight line over the period from grant to end of the service period. The charges for equity settled share-based payments are updated annually for non-market-based vesting conditions.

# Share capital

Ordinary share capital of the Company is recorded as the proceeds received. Company shares held by the employee benefit trusts are held at the consideration paid. They are classified as own shares within equity. Any gain or loss on the purchase, sale or issue of Company shares is recorded in equity.

# Non-controlling interests

The Group recognises non-controlling interest in an acquired entity either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquired entity's net identifiable assets. This decision is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. For non-controlling interests that the Group holds, the Group elected to recognise the non-controlling interests at its proportionate share of the acquired net identifiable assets.

# 37. Critical accounting estimates and judgments in applying accounting policies

# Critical accounting estimates

The following commentary is intended to highlight key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the financial statements in the next financial year.

# Estimation of the Group's defined benefit pension net surplus

The Group's defined benefit pension obligations (and hence the net surplus) are based on key assumptions, including discount rates, mortality and inflation. Management exercises its best judgement, in consultation with actuarial advisors, in selecting the values for these assumptions that are the most appropriate to the Group. Small changes in these assumptions at the balance sheet date, individually or collectively, may result in significant changes in the size of the net surplus/deficit. Further details of these assumptions and the sensitivity of the net pension surplus to changes in these assumptions are set out in note 28.

In addition to the sensitivity of the liability side of the net pension surplus (which will impact the value of the net pension surplus) the net pension surplus is also exposed to significant variation due to changes in the fair value of Scheme assets. A specific sensitivity on assets has not been included in note 28 but any change in valuation of assets flows straight through to the value of the net pension surplus e.g. if equities fall by £10m then the net pension surplus reduces by £10m. The values of unquoted assets assume that an available buyer is willing to purchase those assets at that value. For the Group's portfolio of assets, the unquoted alternative bonds of £253.8m; the unquoted corporate bonds of £120.6m and the unquoted equities of £21.8m are the assets with most uncertainty as to valuation as at 31 March 2024.

# Estimated value of tax assets

The Group has significant levels of unused tax losses and US carried forward interest expenses as set out in note 18 giving rise to potential deferred tax assets. When estimating the appropriate amount that should be recognised, management considers sources of taxable profits including the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and forecast future profits. This estimate is sensitive to similar factors as goodwill, as set out in note 14 and further described in note 18. A range of scenarios are modelled to consider sensitivity to these and other relevant factors (including annual profit levels and growth expectations). Based on these scenarios, it is possible that revisions of these forecasts over the next 12 months could result in up to £11m of the recognised US deferred tax assets not being recoverable.

# Estimates of costs to complete on long-term contracts

The Group has a large number of contracts which span multiple years and are accounted for on a percentage of completion basis in accordance with IFRS 15. Long-term contract accounting requires a number of estimates to be made, particularly in calculating the forecast costs to complete the contract. These forecast costs will be impacted by various factors including numerous risks that could crystallise in the future (with a range of cost outcomes), particularly on contracts of a developmental nature. Across the Group's portfolio of long-term contracts there is a risk that the actual out-turn of these contracts could be different than assumed in the year end contract forecasts, impacting both revenue and operating profit.

For firm price contracts the impact of actual costs being above or below estimated costs would generally impact the contract profitability and the timing of revenue recognition. Costs could increase or decrease based on the level of inflation and the outcome of assumed risk and identified savings positions. As an example, an increase in total forecast costs to complete of  $1\%$  in one of the Group's most significant contracts, would reduce profit by approximately  $\mathbb{L}1\mathsf{m}$  to  $\mathbb{L}2\mathsf{m}$  per annum, on average over the remaining contract duration. Depending on the timing of such cost increases there would be an adjustment to the timing of revenue recognition, which would have no impact on total contract revenue but could impact an individual years revenue by  $\mathbb{L}2\mathsf{m}$  to  $\mathbb{L}3\mathsf{m}$ . In many cases fixed price contracts include inflation uplift clauses, such that inflation of costs would create additional contract value and revenue, thus resulting in increased profit.

# Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

For the year ended 31 March

# 37. Critical accounting estimates and judgments in applying accounting policies (continued)

Critical accounting judgements

Specific, material judgements made by the Directors in applying the Group's accounting policies are set out below:

# Basis of consolidation

The Group comprises certain entities that are operated within the terms of a Special Security Arrangement ('SSA'). Details of the SSA and QinetiQ's management of US subsidiaries are set out in the Corporate Governance section of this Annual Report. IFRS 10 is the accounting standard applicable in respect of consolidation of entities.

This does not specifically deal with SSA's. However, having considered the terms of the SSA, the Directors consider that the Group meets the requirements of IFRS 10 in respect of control over such affected entities and, therefore, consolidates these entities in the consolidated accounts. The impact of this specific judgement is full consolidation as opposed to treatment as a  $100\%$  associated undertaking. Treatment as a  $100\%$  associated undertaking would reduce Group revenue by a material amount (c.£400m per annum) but would have no impact on reported profit, which would include an equivalent amount of profit reported within Other Income as 'Share of profits of joint ventures'.

# Investments

In the Company's financial statements, investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less any impairment in value.

# Share-based payments

The cost of share-based payments in respect of employees of Group subsidiaries is charged to those subsidiary undertakings. In the Company financial statements the recoverable from subsidiaries is credited directly to equity as a capital contribution. The fair value of equity-settled awards for share-based payments is determined on grant and expensed in subsidiary undertakings (and credited to equity in the Company) on a straight line basis over the period from grant to the date of earliest unconditional exercise. The charges for equity-settled share-based payments are updated annually for non-market-based vesting conditions. Further details of the Group's share-based payment charge are disclosed in note 30 to the Group financial statements.

# Current liabilities

Current liabilities include amounts due within the normal operating cycle of the Company. Costs associated with the arrangement of bank facilities or the issue of loans are held net of the associated liability presented in the balance sheet.

# Share capital

Ordinary share capital of the Company is recorded as the proceeds received. Company shares held by the employee benefit trusts are held at the consideration paid. They are classified as own shares within equity. Any gain or loss on the purchase, sale or issue of Company shares is recorded in equity.

# Treasury policy

The Treasury policy is approved by the Audit Committee. There is a structured approach to financial risk management, mitigating exposures to currency, liquidity, counterparty and credit risks as outlined in note 27. The policy allows the use of financial instruments to manage and hedge business operational risks that arise on movements in financial, credit or money markets. There is strict control on the use of financial instruments. Speculative trading in financial instruments is not permitted.

- Currency risk - The Group's income and expenditure is largely settled in the functional currency of the relevant entity. Where cash flows are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant trading entity, the policy is to hedge all material transaction exposure at the point of commitment to the underlying transaction. Uncommitted future transactions are not routinely hedged. Where the timing of cash flows differ from the original expectation, currency swaps will be used to realign the hedge maturity. The maximum permitted hedge period is five years. Translation exposures arising from the consolidation of overseas subsidiaries in foreign currencies are not hedged.

- Interest rate risk - The Group's funding is largely in floating rate debt and subject to the adverse effects of changes in interest rates. The Group has a policy to fix no less than  $30\%$  and no more than  $80\%$  of the debt and spread the risk of fluctuations in interest rates. Options and similar open-ended instruments are not  
Financial credit and liquidity risk – Liquidity risk is managed to ensure funds are available to meet business needs and maximise return subject to counterparty and credit risks. Investments are permitted with institutions on an Approved Counterparty list and must not exceed the counterparty credit limit. Investments must be held in the currency of the reporting entity except currency deposits or borrowings specifically placed to hedge assets or liabilities with related hedge documentation. Group funding is established to meet the Group's medium and long-term financing requirements. Facilities are agreed with a number of financial institutions such that no single institution exerts undue influence on the Group. At the year end the Group had an undrawn revolving credit facility of £275m and term loan of £336m which mature on 27 September 2025 and 27 September 2026 respectively. The term loan has a one-year extension option. The Group refinanced the revolving credit facility at £290m in April 2024 with a three year maturity and two one-year extension options.

The policies manage and control treasury risk in alignment with the Group strategy.

# Tax risk management

QinetiQ's tax strategy, as published on its corporate website, is to ensure compliance with all relevant tax legislation, wherever we do business, while managing our effective tax rates and tax cash flows. Tax is managed in alignment with our corporate responsibility strategy in that we strive to be responsible in all our business dealings with a zero-tolerance of tax evasion. These principles are applied in a consistent and transparent manner in pursuing the tax strategy and in all dealings with tax authorities around the world.

Tax planning - QinetiQ manages both effective tax rate (ETR) and cash tax impacts in line with the Board-endorsed tax strategy. External advice and consultation are sought on potential changes in tax legislation in the UK, the US and elsewhere as necessary, enabling the Group to plan for and mitigate potential changes. QinetiQ does not make use of 'off-shore' entities or tax structures to focus taxable profits in jurisdictions that legislate for low tax rates. QinetiQ has a low risk appetite for tax planning.

- Relationships with tax authorities - QinetiQ is committed to building constructive working relationships with tax authorities based on a policy of full disclosure in order to remove uncertainty in its business transactions and allow the authorities to review possible risks. In the UK, QinetiQ seeks to be open and transparent in its engagement with the tax authorities by sharing with HMRC the methodologies adopted in its tax returns.

- Transfer pricing - QinetiQ does not have a significant level of cross-border activity but this will increase as it pursues its policy of expanding around the globe. Where there is cross-border activity, controls are in place to ensure pricing reflects 'arm's length' principles in compliance with the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines and the laws of the relevant jurisdictions. The Group does not, therefore, have a significant exposure to transfer pricing legislation. QinetiQ submits its 'Country by Country' report to the UK tax authorities in line with the OECD rules providing insight for tax authorities into its global tax affairs.

Governance - The Board has approved this approach. The Audit Committee oversees the tax affairs and risks through periodic reviews. The governance framework is used to manage tax risks, establish controls and monitor their effectiveness. The Group Director of Tax is responsible for ensuring that appropriate policies, processes and systems are in place and that the tax team has the required skills and support to implement this approach.

QinetiQ's corporate tax contribution - QinetiQ is liable to pay tax in its home countries. Changes in tax legislation in these countries would impact the level of tax paid on profits generated by the Group. A significant majority of the Group's profit before tax is generated in the UK where the majority of the Group's business is undertaken and employees are based. Total corporation tax payments in the year to 31 March 2024 were £36.9m (2023: £30.2m).

The differential between the taxation expense and the tax paid in the year relates primarily to the impact of deferred tax movements, whereby the income statement bears tax charges and credits (e.g. on fixed assets or losses) but for which there is no corporation tax paid or recovered in the year. Together, these result in the cash paid being £6.2m less than the total expense charged to the income statement.

# Beware of share fraud

Fraudsters use persuasive and high-pressure tactics to lure investors into scams. They may offer to sell shares that turn out to be worthless or non-existent, or to buy shares at an inflated price in return for an upfront payment. While high profits are promised, if you buy or sell shares in this way you will probably lose your money.

# How to avoid share fraud

1. Keep in mind that firms authorised by the FCA are unlikely to contact you out of the blue with an offer to buy or sell shares.  
2. Do not get into a conversation, note the name of the person and firm contacting you and then end the call.  
3. Check the Financial Services Register from www.fca.org.uk to see if the person and firm contacting you is authorised by the FCA.  
4. Beware of fraudsters claiming to be from an authorised firm, copying its website or giving you false contact details.  
5. Use the firm's contact details listed on the Register if you want to call it back.  
6. Call the FCA on 0800 111 6768 if the firm does not have contact details on the Register or you are told they are out of date.  
7. Search the list of unauthorised firms to avoid at www.fca.org.uk/scams.  
8. Consider that if you buy or sell shares from an unauthorised firm you will not have access to the Financial Ombudsman Service or Financial Services Compensation Scheme.  
9. Think about getting independent financial and professional advice before you hand over any money.  
10. Remember: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

# Report a scam

If you are approached by fraudsters please tell the FCA using the share fraud reporting form at www.fca.org.uk/scams, where you can find out more about investment scams. You can also call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768.
