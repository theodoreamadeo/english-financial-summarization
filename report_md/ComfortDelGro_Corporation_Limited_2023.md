# Dear shareholders,

The year 2023 was a special year for ComfortDelGro as we celebrated 20 years of ensuring safe and meaningful journeys for our communities globally.

It was also a year characterised by significant opportunities and considerable challenges. While global markets remained uncertain and geopolitical tensions prevailed, the transportation industry progressively recovered from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. ComfortDelGro's strong fundamentals as a multi-modal mobility operator with an international footprint helped to anchor the Group's sequential and year-on-year recovery in 2023.

For the financial year ended 31 December 2023, the Group posted a strong performance with Group revenue of S$3.88 billion compared to S$3.78 billion in 2022. Normalised Profit After Tax and Minority Interest (PATMI) climbed 26.6% to S$180.5 million in FY2023 compared to S$142.6 million a year ago, excluding the one-off gain recognised from the sale of the Alperton property in London in 2022. Comparing to 1H2023, 2H2023 revenue was 8.4% higher at S$2.02 billion and PATMI rose 29.9% to S$102.0 million.

We saw sustained recovery across all segments in 2023. The stronger performance in the Group's Public Transport

and Taxi & Private-Hire business segments was driven by higher rail ridership and fare increases in Singapore, lower rental discounts for the taxi fleets in Singapore and China, as well as bus contract renewals and indexation in the United Kingdom (UK).

The Group has taken a proactive approach to managing overall debt exposures to offset financial risks. We actively sought refinancing opportunities at competitive rates, and we are pleased to report that we do not have material debt expiry in the near term. The Group's gross gearing ratio as of 31 December 2023 was  $11.9\%$  compared to  $10.5\%$  in 2022. The Group remained in a net cash position of S\ $497.5 million with S\$ 874.9 million of unutilised banking facilities as of 31 December 2023.

FY2023 earnings per share stood at 8.33 Singapore cents, compared to 7.99 Singapore cents a year ago. As of 31 December 2023, the net asset value per ordinary share was 120.0 Singapore cents, compared to 118.8 Singapore cents as of 31 December 2022.

The Board of Directors is pleased to recommend a final tax-exempt one-tier dividend of 3.76 Singapore cents per share, subject to shareholders' approval at the Annual General Meeting on 26 April 2024. Together with the interim dividend of 2.90 Singapore cents per share paid on 31 August 2023,

the total dividend for 2023 would be 6.66 Singapore cents per share. This translates to a dividend payout ratio of  $80\%$  of PATMI in 2023, which is in line with the Group's updated dividend policy of paying out at least  $70\%$  of PATMI.

# BUILDING SCALE, SHAPING URBAN MOBILITY

Over the past decades, we observed shifts in the way global governments approach transport planning. Inclusive, smart, and green public transport modes have emerged as nations' top priorities as they seek to address urbanisation challenges while meeting climate action goals. As an established mobility player, ComfortDelGro is well placed to leverage our global track record and expertise to shape climate-friendly transport systems in the markets in which we operate.

In the last few years, we have made progress in growing our core businesses and expanding into new overseas markets. The Bus and Taxi businesses continue to be our main pillars of growth, while we sought opportunities to grow our rail services as a strong third pillar. At the same time, we are expanding into new adjacent mobility services and investing in new capabilities to future-proof the Company.

# GROWING CORE BUSINESSES AND EXPANDING INTO NEW MARKETS

Our Public Transport segment has made significant headway since we enhanced our tendering resourcing and capability in recent years.

We won the Bukit Merah bus package for a second consecutive term in Singapore, secured an outer metropolitan bus contract in New South Wales, Australia worth over A$200 million during the year, and clinched 22 bus contracts across the UK. These contract wins reaffirmed the Group's leadership position in our markets, and augment our ability to enable a more sustainable transport future through enhanced customer experience, inclusivity, and innovation.

On the rail service front, we replicated our Singapore and Auckland success in Paris, France in 2023 and announced our market debut in Stockholm, Sweden in 2024. As part of a consortium, we will operate and maintain metro services along the South sector of a new automated line under the 200km Grand Paris Express greenfield metro programme in the Greater Paris region. Our joint venture in Sweden, Connecting Stockholm, is awarded the contract to operate and maintain all of Stockholm Metro's seven lines, including 100 stations, six depots, and 107km of track from May 2025. These breakthroughs into the international rail scene reflect the Group's commitment to grow our core public transportation business and expand into new markets.

Under our Taxi & Private-Hire segment, we remain the largest taxi operator in Singapore, running a fleet of over 8,800 taxis. Recognising the impact of higher operating costs on cabbies' earnings, we increased our taxi fares and adjusted our peak-hour surcharges in Singapore during the year. We have also permanently incorporated a  $10\%$  rental waiver and increased our taxi-booking commission from five to seven percent with effect from 1 January 2024.

During the year, we continued to grow and push our Taxi business beyond the shores of Singapore. In March, we acquired Vedamain, which operates taxis and private hire cars under the KingKabs and Abbey Taxis brands in the UK. To further diversify our point-to-point mobility offering and to transform ourselves into a multi-modal mobility player in Australia, we made a recommended offer in December to acquire A2B Australia, a listed personal transportation provider with more than 8,000 vehicles in its network. The transaction is targeted for completion in the first half of 2024 with the A2B shareholder vote expected to take place in late March 2024.

# EXPANDING ADJACENT MOBILITY OPTIONS AND SERVICES

To support the push for electric vehicle (EV) adoption and address range anxiety of motorists, our joint venture, ComfortDelGro ENGLE, inked a partnership agreement with Malaysia's largest charge point operator Yinson GreenTech to launch the largest combined EV charging network across Singapore and Malaysia. This combined network is set to increase to 8,000 charging points across the two countries by 2030.

# CHAIRMAN AND MANAGING DIRECTOR'S STATEMENT

During the year, we also entered into strategic partnership agreements with our long-time partner Guangzhou Public Transport Group to develop and promote transport-related green energy businesses in China. The joint project includes the delivery of 240 charging points with a total capacity of 21,600kW to cater to the needs of municipal buses and cars to support China's decarbonisation goal.

As part of our partnership with Drive lah, a peer-to-peer carsharing business founded in Singapore and expanded to Australia, we are progressively supplying up to 3,000 vehicles to its operation in Australia to support the increase in demand for carsharing services.

In February 2024, we acquired UK-headquartered CMAC Group, a leading provider of managed ground transportation and accommodation solutions for businesses in Europe. As an established player in providing wide-ranging emergency passenger transport services to businesses, CMAC is complementary to our operations in the UK and Europe, allowing us to expand our business-to-business offerings in the region.

# BUILDING FUTURE CAPABILITIES

The mobility industry is constantly evolving. Megatrends like the electrification of transportation, the rise of mobility as a service, and the increasing importance of connectivity are shaping the future of mobility. To better position ourselves as an enabler of safer, cleaner, and more efficient urban journeys for the community, we need to continue to evolve and future-proof our organisation. In 2019, we set up a US$100 million venture capital fund aimed at investing in a portfolio of technology start-ups in the mobility and automotive industry globally.

In 2023, we invested in Shift4Good, a global independent venture capital impact fund dedicated to financing and supporting promising European and Southeast Asian start-ups with disruptive technologies and scalable business models to revolutionise the mobility industry. We also invested in Ottopia, a start-up focusing on teleoperation technology that can remotely assist, guide and safely control fleets of autonomous vehicles (AV) at scale. Its software can be integrated into the Group's future AV operation centre to enable the adoption of AV technology in our markets when ready.

Beyond being a fleet partner to carsharing platform Drive lah in Australia, we also invested in the company's equity to tap on its car connectivity and navigation technology capabilities. To date, our venture capital fund has invested US$19 million in various promising mobility technology start-ups. We will continue to tap into the advancement of technology to optimise the delivery of our mobility services.

# MAKING HEADWAY IN SUSTAINABILITY

Sustainability is integral to our corporate ethos. We believe that embedding sustainability principles into our business and operations will not only contribute to our long-term success but also to the well-being of the planet and the communities we serve.

Driven by our fleet transition to cleaner vehicles, we are on track to halve our Scope 1 and Scope 2 Greenhouse Gas emissions by 2032. Today, hybrids and EVs account for more than  $48\%$  of our global fleet as we aim to transit  $90\%$  of our car fleet and  $50\%$  of our bus fleet to cleaner vehicles by 2030.

With people at the very heart of our business, we strive to foster an inclusive culture within our workforce. We maintain an active dialogue with our employees, sharing our business goals and understanding their career concerns and aspirations. At the same time, we are committed to enhance the skills and well-being of our people through development programmes and engagement initiatives. We believe that our efforts uphold the spirit of Tripartism and will continue to maintain positive relationships with trade unions and their representatives. Beyond the value that we delivered to shareholders, we have deepened our engagement with, and made significant contributions to, the communities in which we operate. In 2023, we contributed S$1.5 million of cash donations and close to S$3 million of donations in-kind to build an inclusive and resilient society, with a focus on education, community inclusiveness, and accessibility.

44

We believe that embedding sustainability principles into our business and operations will not only contribute to our long-term success but also to the well-being of the planet and the communities we serve.

”

Our efforts have not gone unnoticed. We clinched the Singapore Corporate Governance Award (Diversity category) at the Securities Investors Association (Singapore) Investors' Choice Awards 2023, and were named the top company in the World Benchmarking Alliance's assessment of the 90 most influential transportation firms globally. We have also maintained our "AA" grade in the Morgan Stanley Capital International ESG rating, and continue to be one of only five Singapore companies to remain as a constituent on the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (Asia Pacific).

For more details of our ESG initiatives, please read our Sustainability Report 2023.

# BOARD RENEWAL

We would like to extend our deepest appreciation to Mr Lim Jit Poh, our Founding Chairman who retired in April 2023. As one of the longest-serving Chairmen in corporate Singapore, Mr Lim has played an instrumental role in laying ComfortDelGro's strategic foundation, and building the Group's capabilities beyond Singapore for the past decades. Mr Lim has graciously accepted our invitation to accept the honorary title of Chairman Emeritus.

We would also like to thank Ms Sum Wai Fun Adeline who stepped down as an Independent Non-Executive Director in April 2023. Ms Sum had served on various Board Committees throughout her tenure of 16 years with us, and her deep insights and wise counsel had been invaluable to the Group.

In January, we welcomed Ms Susan Kong Yim Pui as an Independent Non-Executive Director. Ms Kong, a practising lawyer for more than 30 years, brings with her deep expertise in the areas of banking and finance, real estate, M&A and capital markets. In April, Mr Tan Peng Hoe, Steve joined the Board as an Independent Non-Executive Director. Mr Tan is the Division Director of Membership Services Division of the National Trades Union Congress as well as the Executive Secretary of the Union of Security Employees. At ComfortDelGro, the Nominating Committee ensures that there is a balanced tripartite experience from government, labour and business to demonstrate our commitment and focus on employee well-being and stakeholder interests.

Earlier this year, we also made some changes to our Board Committees. Having completed the digitalisation of the Group's taxi booking system, the Digitalisation Committee was dissolved. The Group's continuing digitalisation journey will be managed by the Management with oversight from the Board. The Investment Committee has been renamed to Strategy & Investment Committee, with the added responsibility of reviewing the implementation of corporate strategy plans approved by the Board.

While the Board is relatively young with an average tenure of less than four years, our 10 Directors are experts in key fields pertinent to ComfortDelGro with their collective experience contributing to a strategic vision that is forward-thinking. The Nominating and Remuneration Committee will continue to observe its Board Diversity Policy and consciously review the competencies of the directors in the context of the evolving business and economic landscape to ensure that the Board will always be effective.

# CREATING SUSTAINABLE VALUE

The past two decades were challenging yet rewarding. We have built a track record of successes both at home in Singapore and beyond these shores. We remain focused on improving our core performance and deepening our presence in key international markets while serving our local communities to the very best of our ability. As we stay the course and remain disciplined in our investment for the future, we are strategically allocating resources to initiatives that have the potential for sustained growth, fostering resilience and enduring value for the Group for years to come.

In closing, we wish to express our heartfelt gratitude to each stakeholder and every employee for being an integral part of our two-decade story, and thank you for continuing the exciting journey with ComfortDelGro as we build scale and play our part in shaping urban mobility. We strive to grow from strength to strength, and to deliver sustainable value as we embark on our next phase of growth.

# SCHEDUED BUS

SBS Transit Ltd, Singapore's biggest public bus operator, boasts a fleet of 3,572 buses, commanding a  $62\%$  market share. Operating from 15 bus terminals and 18 interchanges, the Company averaged 30,258 daily bus trips in 2023.

Entering its seventh year of operations under the Bus Contracting Model (BCM), SBS Transit operated two tendered contracts — the Bukit Merah and Seletar Bus Packages — for a five-year term each and seven bus packages under negotiated contracts where it is the incumbent operator.

In August 2023, SBS Transit was awarded the Bukit Merah bus package for a second consecutive term, marking the third bus tender award it has won under the BCM. Under this model, the Government retains fare revenue and owns all infrastructure and operating assets such as depots

and buses. Bus operators are contracted and paid to operate public bus services through a competitive tendering process.

Approximately  $90\%$  of SBS Transit's fleet complies with the Euro 5 emissions standard minimising environmental pollution. It also operates 57 green buses, comprising 32 fully electric and 25 diesel-hybrid ones.

In the area of safety, SBS Transit continued to invest in training, systems and technology to help its Bus Captains (BCs) become safer drivers. SBS Transit also started trialling digital side mirrors on its buses to further enhance visibility for BCs. These advanced mirrors utilised high-definition digital cameras and internal displays that significantly expanded the BCs' field of vision and enabled them to closely monitor their blind spots. Notably, the level of brightness of the mirrors were adjusted automatically to eliminate glare for optimal visibility during both day-time and night-time operations. The trial will be expanded to include more buses in 2024.

SBS Transit's commitment to safety was lauded at the Public Transport Safety and Security Awards Day in 2023. Both the Jurong West and Sengkang-Hougang bus packages received prestigious accolades, highlighting their dedication to creating a safe and secure environment for passengers and employees. The Jurong West package received the Operational and Workplace Safety (Bus) Excellence Award, while Sengkang-Hougang nabbed the Merit Award.

Further solidifying its commitment to workforce development, SBS Transit was conferred the Workplace Learning Organisation of Excellence (Platinum) Award in October 2023. This highest accolade from the National Centre of Excellence for Workplace Learning recognised SBS Transit's exemplary efforts in fostering a culture of continuous learning and growth within the organisation.

# UNSCHEDUED BUS

The Group's wholly-owned subsidiary, ComfortDelGro Bus Pte Ltd, operates a fleet of more than 250 buses which provides employee and school bus charters, premium bus services, and shuttle bus services for industrial parks, shopping malls, educational institutions and condominiums.

During the year, ComfortDelGro Bus successfully won four new contracts and extended 29 existing ones. The Company also secured bus charters for over 10 events, including, the Singapore Festival of Football, National Day Parade, Standard Chartered Singapore Marathon, ferrying election officials and volunteers during the Presidential Election, and multiple open houses for polytechnics and universities.

Despite the high demand for private bus charters, driver shortages and soaring operating costs posed a challenge to the business. The Company had to increase sub-contracting services and actively recruit more drivers to meet demand. Meanwhile, travel patterns have shifted due to work-from-home trends, making some Premium Bus Services unprofitable. These routes have been terminated and the Company is actively assessing new routes with profitability potential.

In April 2023, ComfortDelGro Bus operationalised a fully electric bus fleet for two university campus shuttle services at the National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University, providing more than 50 electric buses operating 12 shuttle services within the campuses.

In September 2023, ComfortDelGro Bus partnered with GreenRoad to trial a real-time driving performance monitoring system on its buses, allowing drivers to view and address areas for improvement, leading to safer and smoother rides for passengers.

To cap off the year, the Company swept up key accolades at the annual Road Safety Awards 2023, jointly organised by the Traffic Police, Land Transport Authority, and Workplace Safety & Health Council. ComfortDelGro Bus clinched the Merit Award in the nonpublic bus fleet category, and two of its BCs won the Safe Driver Award, showcasing their exemplary efforts in keeping the roads safe.

Beyond safety, ComfortDelGro Bus was also recognised for its contributions to Singapore's fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company's dedication earned itself the President's Certificate of Commendation (COVID-19) for its role in safely transporting COVID-19 patients to and from quarantine facilities using its private buses.

# RAIL

SBS Transit operates 83km of rail networks in Singapore, encompassing the North East Line (NEL), Downtown Line (DTL), and Sengkang-Punggol Light Rail Transit (SPLRT) systems. This represents  $30.6\%$  of the total rail network in Singapore and comprises 78 stations served by a fleet of 198 trains.

In 2023, SBS Transit's rail services experienced an  $18.7\%$  growth in demand, clocking in a total of 428.1 million passenger trips across the three lines, compared to 360.7 million the previous year.

Notably, the NEL saw an increase of  $17.3\%$  in average daily ridership compared to the previous year, catering to a total of over 570,000 passenger trips, while the SPLRT experienced a  $17.4\%$  increase to make a total of close to 160,000 passenger trips. The DTL experienced a higher rate of growth, with average daily ridership rising  $21\%$  to more than 443,000 passenger trips.

In 2023, all three rail lines operated by SBS Transit experienced no major disruptions. In terms of Mean Kilometre Between Failure, an international measure of railway reliability, the DTL clocked 8.12 million train-km in 2023, which doubled its achievement of 4.05 million train-km in the previous year. The DTL surpassed the nationwide

MRT network's average of 2.08 million train-km and, for the third year running, remained the most reliable MRT line globally. The NEL clocked in a steady 2.06 million train-km, while the SPLRT achieved a record high of 1.22 million car-km, earning it the Most Improved System Award at the 2023 Global Light Rail Awards in London.

The mid-life refurbishment of SBS Transit's first-generation NEL trains made significant progress during the year, with seven completed and two more undergoing upgrades. These refurbished trains boast new features, including condition monitoring systems that minimise breakdowns by alerting to potential issues and allowing for remote monitoring of vital parameters to optimise operational decisions. Passengers on these refurbished trains will also benefit from the upgraded interiors and enhanced air-conditioning and ventilation systems.

SBS Transit's workplace safety initiatives paid off in 2023, with a  $5.46\%$  reduction in injury rates to 181.35 accidents per 100,000 employees. This improvement can be attributed to a focus on safety awareness programmes, a virtual reality training simulator for staff, and the exploration of innovative technologies. These technologies include a portable AI-powered device

mounted on train consoles that assists drivers by monitoring track conditions, train speed, and driver attentiveness, as well as an autonomous AI robot dog that assists technicians with visual inspections, identifying potential faults that might be missed by human eyes.

# TAXI & PRIVATE-HIRE

ComfortDelGro Taxi remains as Singapore's largest taxi operator with a combined fleet of over 8,800 Comfort and CityCab taxis, translating into a market share of  $64.8\%$ .

Since launching its ride-hailing service in 2021, its private-hire car (PHC) fleet has been growing steadily. As of the end of 2023, it boasts a fleet of 610 PHCs, with more than 6,200 drivers on board its ride-hailing platform, Zig.

The Zig app was modernised in May 2023, adding more functionalities and services such as ZigRewards and Deals, creating a single platform for passengers' mobility and lifestyle requirements. With an array of enticing vouchers covering dining, entertainment, and lifestyle options, app users can now earn and utilise rewards beyond their transportation journeys.

In September 2023, ComfortDelGro Taxi implemented a major upgrade to its routing and dispatch systems on both its passenger and driver platforms. Passengers now enjoy real-time "Estimated Time to Pick Up" and "Estimated Time to Arrival" directly in

the app, allowing them to plan their journeys better. For private-hire drivers, the seamless integration of Google Maps directly into the app allowed them to navigate efficiently with minimal distractions, reducing the need for excessive device interaction while on the road.

In November 2023, ComfortDelGro Taxi launched 30 units of Lexus ES300H limousine taxis without the traditional rooftop taxi sign on a six-month trial. Instead, they were equipped with the first-ever in-vehicle LED displays in Singapore. The Company plans to expand the use of these in-vehicle LED displays to its main fleet of taxis in the coming years if the trial is successful.

To help drivers to ease the burden of cost, ComfortDelGro Taxi continued to offer rental waivers of up to  $10 \%$ to its cabbies throughout 2023, amounting to a total of S $\$ 33.6$ million. Drivers with longer service contracts also received higher daily rental discounts and rental- free days, in recognition of their loyalty and years of service.

With the support of National Taxi Association and our cabbies, the Company increased its taxi fares and

![](images/af12667d6ce97ce41f73d39c970b0274b79df3629da36f3b05d31cab09b286b9.jpg)

adjusted its peak hours with effect from 13 December 2023. It has also permanently incorporated the  $10 \%$ rental waiver and increased its taxi- booking commission from five to seven percent with effect from 1 January 2024. On the whole, the revisions of the fares will help cabbies to improve their earnings.

While there was an increase in taxi ridership, some cabbies still face challenges when sidelined by COVID-19. To mitigate the impact, ComfortDelGro Taxi allocated over S\\(336,000 in financial aid to these cabbies in 2023.

To retain its existing cabbies and attract new ones, ComfortDelGro Taxi not only offered contract schemes that came with attractive incentives and payouts, but also medical benefits. ComfortDelGro Taxi introduced the Prolonged Medical Leave (PML) insurance plan to offer up to 70 days of daily payouts to all its hirers and eligible PHC drivers. Under the PML plan, hirers and eligible PHC drivers receive S\\(80 per day from the eighth day of hospitalisation or medical leave. As of the end of 2023, 532 hirers had benefitted from this plan.

As one of two remaining appointed training centres, ComfortDelGro Taxi conducts both the Taxi Driver's Vocational Licence (TDVL) and Private Hire Car Driver's Vocational Licence (PDVL) courses for P2P drivers. As of December 2023, 6,439 trainees had attended the courses, with a passing rate above  $90\%$ . New hirers who had passed the TDVL course were also offered 12 days' worth of free rental.

In support of Singapore's Green Plan 2023, ComfortDelGro Taxi accelerated its fleet electrification, rolling out 76 BYD e6 electric taxis, bringing its total electric taxi fleet size to 172. To support the growing fleet of electric taxis, ComfortDelGro Taxi also installed 10 dedicated fast EV charging stations at the CityCab building. The Company has over 6,000 cleaner energy vehicles in its taxi fleet.

# AUTOMOTIVE ENGINEERING

Our automotive engineering subsidiary, ComfortDelGro Engineering Pte Ltd, not only maintains the Group's taxis, unscheduled buses, training and rental cars, but also operates a thriving private vehicle repair service.

Throughout 2023, ComfortDelGro Engineering's external business saw revenues surge  $10.5\%$ , elevated by rising demand and increased customer retention fuelled by robust online and offline advertising and direct marketing campaigns. To meet this growing demand, the taxi maintenance workshops merged with the external vehicle maintenance workshops in Braddell, Loyang, and Pandan in April 2023, optimising resource utilisation. This created a common pool of technicians and ensured that the workshops are better equipped to handle surges in vehicle intake.

ComfortDelGro Engineering also launched its Fleet Maintenance Portal. This web-based platform offers comprehensive fleet data including maintenance schedules, appointment monitoring, fleet availability, displays vehicle repair status, and historical maintenance records, empowering fleet managers to optimise their operations and make informed decisions.

ComfortDelGro Engineering participated in several major tenders in 2023. The Company was appointed by VICOM as one of their approved workshops for On-Board Unit installation and also secured a three-year contract with SBS Transit to overhaul LRT bogies. Furthermore, the Company was re-awarded a three-year contract by the Public Utilities Board to maintain their fleet of vehicles.

In October 2023, ComfortDelGro Engineering Academy secured a significant project with the Singapore Civil Defence Force to develop and conduct specialised training with a focus on rescue, evacuation and firefighting involving electric vehicles.

During the year, ComfortDelGro Engineering Academy also trained over 270 technicians in the National Electric Vehicle Specialist Safety (NESS) course which equips participants with the skills and knowledge to safely handle high voltage systems in hybrid and electric vehicles.

In June 2023, the Company secured exclusive distributorship of ChangAn KuaYue (KYC) V7 electric commercial vans.

ComfortDelGro Engineering was re-certified for the Quality Management System ISO 9001:2015 standard and the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Management System ISO 45001:2018 standard during the year. The former provides assurance that the Company's operations are planned and managed effectively, consistently meeting and exceeding customer expectations in its service delivery, while the latter attests to the Company's dedication to upholding strong WSH practices.

The Company also achieved bizSAFE STAR certification in 2023, the highest level in the bizSAFE enterprise programme by the Workplace Safety and Health Council of Singapore, further solidifying its dedication to employee well-being.

With over 770 charging points active in 2023, CDG ENGIE offers convenient access for EV consumers and fleet operators who can leverage its network across key regions in Singapore.

Besides enabling charging points in publicly accessible locations such as carparks and community spaces, CDG ENGIE also supports the deployment of charging points at non-landed private residences such as condominiums, and businesses looking to tap into the EV charging infrastructure installation and management services.

In October 2023, CDG ENGIE inked a partnership agreement with Malaysia's largest EV charge point operator, Yinson GreenTech, to create the largest

combined EV charging network across Singapore and Malaysia, boasting over 8,000 charging points by 2030 and offering seamless charging for long-distance EV travellers.

During the year, CDG ENGIE was also appointed as a pre-qualified Electric Vehicle Charging Operator (EVCO) to have more charging stations island-wide at publicly accessible sites, a growing testimony of its reputation in the market as one of Singapore's leading EVCOs after securing contracts to progressively deploy up to 5,000 charging points.

CDG ENGIE is also a Progressive Wage Mark-accredited company committed towards supporting and uplifting the welfare and career of our workers.

# INSPECTION & TESTING SERVICES

VICOM Ltd continued to experience strong demand in 2023, with a record 520,895 vehicles passing through its inspection lanes, thereby maintaining its leading position with a market share of over  $72\%$ .

The revised Vehicular Emissions Scheme and the two-year extension of the EV Early Adoption Incentive confirmed the determination of the Government in its push for clean energy vehicle adoption, with an emphasis on electric and other zero emission cars. VICOM inspected a total of 3,389 EVs and 38,781 hybrids during the year, compared to 1,661 and 37,371 in 2022.

The VICOM Emission Test Laboratory experienced an increase in emissions test volume compared to 2022, as a result of the mandatory adoption of Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP) standards for newly registered passenger vehicles

starting 1 January 2024 and also the release of more Certificate of Entitlement quotas in the last quarter of the year.

VICOM's non-vehicle testing arm, Setsco Services Pte Ltd (SETSCO), witnessed robust demand for some sectors, but was dampened by the contraction of the manufacturing sector.

SETSCO actively pursued new opportunities in 2023, significantly enhancing its non-vehicle testing capabilities by securing accreditation for drug residue analysis, bolstering its expertise with relaxation testing for wire strands, expanding material testing capabilities to measure soil and aggregate resilient modulus, and adding wood drill resistance testing.

SETSCO also expanded into cybersecurity testing with the strategic acquisition of a  $70\%$  stake in An Security Pte Ltd, a cybersecurity specialist that provides security evaluation and testing services for IT products.

More details can be found in VICOM's 2023 Annual Report.

# DRIVING CENTRE

In 2023, ComfortDelGro Driving Centre Pte Ltd, which provides learner driver training services in Singapore, continued to maintain its market share of over  $40 \%$ for Class 3/3A learners’ enrolment in driving schools.

The Centre experienced robust demand for both driving and riding lessons during the year, particularly from foreign learner drivers who picked up driving lessons as part of industry upskilling. Apart from new learners taking up driving and riding lessons, an increasing number of licensed car drivers attended refresher courses on their driving skills and road safety awareness. To improve the convenience of the sign-up process, the Centre introduced online course enrolment.

As part of its corporate governance efforts, ComfortDelGro Driving Centre managed to obtain the Progressive

![](images/75aea92c661a5d5c4b0e13e1625f17f17ecd78a4b44fd0223d9cef88d78f622d.jpg)

Wage Mark accreditation which advocates for fair employment and remuneration. In addition, it also achievedbizSAFE Level 3 recognition that underscores its commitment towards workplace safety and health.

Furthermore, to deliver a higher quality of coaching and professional training, the Centre has had 18 driving instructors certified with the Workforce Skills Qualifications Train-the-Trainer programme. As a result of all these efforts, the Centre successfully secured contracts with clients from the public and private sectors to conduct training and driving tests.

In support of all these efforts, the Centre launched Singapore's first

Electric Motorcycle Familiarisation Course in February 2023. This course is created especially for motorcyclists who already possess valid Class 2A or 2B licences and are raring to try out e-motorcycles. The three-hour session provides both theory and practical training on operating e-motorcycles, the differences between internal combustion engine and electric motorcycles, the benefits and risks as well as battery management and charging guidelines.

In September 2023, the Centre also added five more electric cars – the Hyundai Kona Electric (Standard Range) – to its electric vehicle training fleet for a total of 10 electric cars for its Class 3A Licence Course.

# NON-EMERGENCY PATIENT TRANSPORT SERVICES

ComfortDelGro MedCare Pte Ltd provides wheelchair transport services for mobility-impaired passengers, persons with disabilities and senior citizens, and is the largest wheelchair transport service provider in Singapore.

Having fully acquired Ming Chuan  
Transportation in March 2023,  
ComfortDelGro MedCare now  
has a fleet size of 103 wheelchair  
transportation vans and about  
120 drivers and medical escorts.  
Transporting approximately 1,000  
patients a day on average, the  
Company served a network of daycare, dialysis and physical disability centres across the island, in the domain of eldercare and medical escort services.

As the labour markets progressively recovered after the pandemic, many families remained in constant need of assistance to ferry the elderly at home for their medical appointments, rehabilitation and leisure activities. As such, the demand for professional transport and medical escort services is expected to continue trending upward.

To better keep up with the growing demand, the Company continued to invest in vehicle safety, such as wheelchair retractor sets and closed-

circuit televisions, and its despatch systems. The Company also focused on staff training, which included safe driving and patient transfer skills, as well as cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

# CAR RENTAL & LEASING

During the year, our car rental and leasing subsidiary, ComfortDelGro Rent-A-Car Pte Ltd, operated a fleet of 1,813 passenger and commercial vehicles, of which 610 were PHCs.

2023 saw the COE premiums skyrocketing across all vehicle categories, impacting the fleet growth of many rental companies. Several competitors took the opportunity to raise rental rates of their ageing PHC fleets, resulting in many hirers opting not to renew their leases. With its relatively young fleet, ComfortDelGro Rent-A-Car was able to maintain a healthy hire-out of its PHC vehicles at good rates.

Amidst global economic uncertainty in 2023, ComfortDelGro Rent-A-Carsaw price-sensitive clients prioritise lease renewals or downsizing to more affordable vehicles. Despite this, the Company secured the renewal of 400 vehicle rental contracts at good rates and retained  $17\%$  more customers for its corporate and individual accounts than in 2022, demonstrating its resilience in

![](images/9fd015ee7b427f9553c6593bf755e476e8798256f23e9ce98da0d1439982d38d.jpg)

a challenging market. To secure more long-term contracts, ComfortDelGro Rent-A-Car also continued to focus on both government and corporate contracts, and expanded its outreach to the statutory boards.

The electric light goods vehicle (eLGV) segment remained challenging due to higher costs compared to internal combustion engine models. In response, the Company focused its efforts on larger corporates with sustainability goals and expanded its eLGV fleet by  $17\%$ .

The Company also integrated all PHC rental functionalities into its Zig Rent app in 2023, enabling a seamless digital experience where PHC hirers can manage various transactions digitally, from onboarding as well as vehicle checkouts and returns to payments via in-app QR codes.

Besides improving its digital offerings, the Company also leveraged its online presence by running targeted lead-generation campaigns on Facebook for various seasonal promotions and successfully improved sales.

# INSURANCE BROKING SERVICES

ComfortDelGro Insurance Brokers Pte Ltd assists the Group and its external corporate clients in providing insurance broking, employee benefits consulting, analytics, risk management and claims advocacy services across all classes of insurance.

Amidst challenging headwinds in 2023 and a tightening insurance market marked by persistent price increases and diminishing capacity for certain risks such as property, casualty and cybersecurity, ComfortDelGro Insurance worked at developing innovative and customised alternative risk transfer solutions for several of the Group's business units. The Company worked with an insurer who issued a multi-year programme that covered a wide range of risk exposures on its behalf. This resulted in several millions of dollars in cost savings for the Group.

![](images/ba31350785a300f4c0e1868a26e5b277be254dd72f733ab9ceccfcc50f9e6092.jpg)

Outside of the Group, the Company also grew its new third-party business revenue for the year by around half a million dollars and remained profitable. A marketing campaign was undertaken in the last quarter of 2023, which expanded the customer base of its "insureSG" app by over  $400\%$ . New digital insurance initiatives and products are also in progress for launch in 2024.

# OUTDOOR ADVERTISING

With industry growth hovering around  $5 \%$ , Moove Media Pte Ltd, ComfortDelGro’s outdoor advertising arm, defied the trend with a  $20 \%$ revenue increase. This impressive growth is testament the unit’s dedication to creating impactful campaigns and strategic initiatives that embrace current digital trends and leverage first- party data.

One of Moove Media's most notable campaigns was the launch of the new Mandai Bird Paradise. The campaign featured larger-than-life 3D birds perched atop buses, immersive transformations at bus hubs, and a 40-metre digital bird migration showcase alongside the Dhoby Ghaut MRT traveler, making a strong impact to the audience.

Moove Media expanded its digital presence in Singapore in 2023,

launching two new digital sites in MRT stations. The immersive Serangoon Groove captures audiences face-on with a curved panoramic wall, and the record-breaking Outram Travelator is now the longest digital wall in an MRT station, spanning 54 metres or 57,600 pixels wide, and serving millions of commuters monthly.

During the year, Moove Media also introduced MooveSmart, an innovative data dashboard providing audience measurement and behavioural insights at rail stations and bus hubs. This tool empowered advertisers to find their audiences, while paving the way for impression-based buying similar to digital online and digital out-of-home ads. Moove Media also educated clients and agencies in comprehensive sessions about current challenges, showcasing how first-party data can guide them through their transformation and optimise campaign performance.

As of 2023, all of Moove Media's digital screens are now programmatically integrated, enabling buying of advertisement seamlessly via a platform for connected clients and agencies. Moove Media secured its first programmatic campaign in September 2023.

We operate bus services in Australia through ComfortDelGro Corporation Australia Pty Ltd (CDC), which has been the Group's subsidiary since October 2005.

CDC NSW, a subsidiary of CDC, runs designated route services in the Metropolitan, Outer Metropolitan and Regional areas of NSW, as well as the Australian Capital Territory (ACT).

CDC NSW operates under multiple brands: CDC NSW in Metropolitan Sydney, Blue Mountains Transit, Hunter Valley Buses, and Coastal Liner in Outer Metropolitan Regions. In regional areas of NSW and ACT, it operates CDC Canberra, CDC Broken Hill, Blanch's Bus Lines, Brunswick Valley Coaches, and Forest Coach Lines, including Woopi Connect on-demand services.

In June 2023, CDC NSW collaborated with the government to expand bus services in the Hunter Valley region.

Two new routes were introduced, along with adjustments to existing routes and increased frequency on weekends and evenings, providing 506 additional weekly services. This expansion led to an average nine percent growth in ridership and improved customer satisfaction.

In July 2023, CDC NSW was awarded the Outer Metropolitan Bus Service Contract for Region 7, worth over A$200 million. Covering the NSW Central Coast, including The Entrance, Gosford, Wyong and surrounding areas, the eight-year contract commencing in July 2024 was awarded by the NSW Government to Red Bus CDC NSW – a 50:50 joint venture between CDC NSW and Red Bus Services.

CDC NSW also offers flexible charters for schools, businesses, and individuals at St Marys, Cromer (Northern Beaches), and Halloran (Central Coast) through CDC Charter. In 2023, CDC Charter secured contracts with Arndell College, Sydney Trains, and Western Sydney

# VICTORIA

# BUS

CDC Victoria operates essential bus services across the Western, Eastern and Northern suburbs of Melbourne, and the Greater Cities of Ballarat, Geelong, Mildura and Wentworth.

In 2023, CDC Victoria's Tarneit North FlexiRide, an on-demand bus service with no fixed route and operating only when booked, was the most successful FlexiRide service in Victoria, according to the Department of Transport & Planning. Launched in 2022 to serve the rapidly developing area of Tarneit North, this five-year service contract provided crucial transportation options for residents who previously lacked public transport access. During its first year, the service completed 74,000 booked rides. Within that time, it had approximately 3,500 registered users, with most having taken five or more rides.

2023 also saw a major boost in safety for CDC's operations in Victoria with the rollout of a new telematics platform. This platform features the GreenRoad Driver Behaviour Solution, a real-time feedback system. It helps drivers avoid accidents, improves passenger comfort, reduces fuel consumption and emissions, as well as enhances operational efficiency. Over

500 buses in CDC Victoria are already on this platform. Since its launch in October 2023, the fleet has seen significant improvements in risk and safety scores, along with high driver engagement within depots.

In Melbourne, CDC Victoria's trial of zero-emission buses from its Oakleigh depot continued with three Volvo BZL battery electric buses operating as of December 2023. Five additional vehicles are slated to be rolled out by mid-2024. Complementing this trial is a collaboration with Monash University for both out-of-depot charging and PhD research programmes focusing on energy optimisation and battery performance in zero-emission buses.

# NON-EMERGENCY PATIENT TRANSPORT SERVICES

NPT remained the market dominant private provider of non-emergency patient transport services in Victoria in 2023.

Despite facing a tight labour market for drivers in 2023, CDC Regional Australia Division achieved a  $15 \%$ increase in passenger ridership across its Queanbeyan and Coffs Harbour operations. Collaborating with the NSW Government, CDC Regional Australia Division delivered A $\$ 1$ million in expanding services, including network redesign and deployment of new buses in Queanbeyan and Coffs Harbour. These improvements benefited the community directly, resulting in

improved accessibility, reduced wait times, and a  $50 \%$ increase in fare revenue in Queanbeyan alone.

In 2023, CDC's Qcity Transit and Transborder Express joined forces to form a unified bus service under the new CDC Canberra brand. Spanning the ACT and Southern NSW, CDC Canberra transports over 5 million passengers annually with a dedicated fleet of more than 145 buses stationed across three depots, ensuring reliable connections for residents, commuters, and students alike.

Like our arm in Victoria, CDC Canberra also implemented the new telematics platform, featuring GreenRoad Driver Behaviour Solution to enhance safety and operations similar to that.

CDC expanded its reach in Alice Springs by securing a special needs bus services contract in July 2023, through CDC Northern Territory which won the tender from an incumbent operator. The win strengthened CDC Northern Territory's position as the Red Centre town's dedicated public transport provider, committed to serving the diverse needs of the community. CDC Northern Territory also won a five-year contract for the provision of the first dedicated school bus services in Tennant Creek, located approximately 1,000km south of Darwin. The contract is set to commence in the first school term of 2024.

CDC's Queensland operations expanded its reach when the Department of Transport and Main Roads awarded CDC Gladstone the addition of two Specialist School Transport buses. The buses will operate from the first term of 2024.

During the year, CDC was successful in a Transport for NSW Expression of Interest submission to trial zero-emission buses in its regional and rural contracts covering parts of Regional New South Wales. These trials are expected to include CDC Canberra and commence in early 2025.

In Queensland, CDC Gladstone secured the CS Energy - Employee Industrial Transport contract, which started in September 2023. The buses operate day and night shifts, seven days a week, transporting workers to their accommodation from the Callide Power Station. The contract was initially ten months with a potential eight-month extension. CDC Sunshine Coast secured the Peregian Beach shuttle, operational from early December 2023 to mid-January 2024, which provides free travel from Peregian to Noosa Heads across the peak tourist season.

Charter services across Regional NSW saw significant growth, expanding into less traditional markets like industrial, community, and large-scale

events. Traditional markets of school and government special events also exceeded expectations. CDC Canberra was a strong performer, capturing major revenue customers like Snowy Hydro, Floriade, Spilt Milk, Trainlink, and Transport Canberra.

# LONDON

# BUS

In the United Kingdom (UK), our wholly owned subsidiary, Metroline operates about  $16\%$  of London's scheduled buses mileage with a fleet of close to 1,300 buses, plying routes in North, West and Central London. It is the fourth largest scheduled bus operator in the city.

As the UK emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic, ridership levels improved to a monthly average of 140 million trips, a  $12 \%$ increase from that of 2022. Despite the ridership increase, it was still about  $6 \%$ lower in the same month in 2019. This was due to remote working, weakened tourism and passengers’ disinclination towards public transport

as the expansion of low-speed zones and construction of cycling lanes by local authorities contributed to longer journey time.

Transport for London (TfL) continued to revise routes across all of London to taper service volume according to demand. This effectively reduced the routes serviced by Metroline and alleviated the shortage of drivers in the short term, which the Company and the industry at large faced.

2023 witnessed a fall in market competition due to labour constraints with a higher average tender contract value due to increased capital expenditure needed to invest in zero-emissions vehicles. During the year, Metroline won a total of 22 contracts, which included four new ones.

![](images/919f61e089c54ab974f5ef4a49633b99014967c5f05a9a890506b23186f74490.jpg)

To attract more drivers, Metroline launched the "Me in Metroline" recruitment campaign in March 2023, via a mixture of channels including social media platforms, print brochures and bus wrap advertisements on the buses of its training fleet, as well as directly to drivers of third-party agencies. The campaign helped to reduce the shortfall of drivers from  $10.4\%$  to  $8.3\%$  by December 2023. To keep pace with the cost of living, Metroline drivers got an  $8\%$  rise in pay in 2023 after negotiation with the trade union.

Complementing its recruitment effort, Metroline also invested in driver retention and well-being through a collaboration with TfL by launching Mobileye — an advanced driver assistance system that is designed to alert the driver of potential collisions. The safety-enhancing system was fitted to almost 90 buses in a 12-month trial that started in July 2023, and was well received by drivers.

In the area of environmental sustainability, the Company continued to invest in green vehicles and electrifying its garages, in support of TfL's goal of a zero-emission bus fleet by 2034. At the end of 2023, Metroline had 20 hydrogen-powered buses as well as 212 electric buses, with 74 more electric buses expected in the first half of 2024. The trial of its hydrogen fuel cell double-decker buses, despite being impeded by hydrogen availability due to supply chain issues, stayed on course with the support and mitigation funding from TfL.

The Company also commenced two other trials ranging from nine to 12 months at its garages, utilising artificial intelligence algorithms to predict real-time journey information such as road traffic conditions. This helped bus drivers to reduce wait time and improve their Quality Incentive Contract performance.

# COACH

Based in London, Westbus Coach Services Limited provides executive coach services across the UK and mainland Europe, catering to a broad spectrum of school, tourist and corporate coach hire passengers.

During the year, Westbus Coach Services was met with strong demand for coach hire services from all sectors as inbound tourism returned to pre-pandemic level and tourist group bookings increased by a large margin of  $35\%$ . The Company had in 2022 signed a major contract to supply three coaches to Evan Evans Sightseeing Tours to run day trips to tourist hotspots across the Southeast of England from London, which accounted for a  $30\%$  increase of its yearly revenue.

Besides tourist coach services, the Company also saw high demand in other areas such as private and corporate hire, rail replacement and school services. Westbus Coach Services expanded its existing fleet with two new 57-seater Volvo B11R 9900 and one new 85-seater double-decker Alexander Dennis (ADL) Enviro400. As such, the Company took on  $54\%$  more school excursions and coach-hire trips to European destinations such as France, Belgium, Germany and Spain in 2023.

Notwithstanding the slew of demand, the industry continued to face the challenging issue of driver recruitment and retention. In a bid to retain existing drivers and attract new ones, Westbus Coach Services adjusted its drivers' pay by  $11\%$ .

# LIVERPOOL

# TAXI RADIO CIRCUIT AND PRIVATE CAR HIRE

CityFleet Networks operates Computer Cab (Liverpool), the City's largest taxi circuit operator, and Argyle Satellite, the largest private-hire company in the Wirral suburb of the city.

With a combined fleet of over 1,500 black cabs and PHCs. CityFleet Networks caters to both corporate and individual clientele.

In March 2023, CityFleet Networks acquired Vedamain, a Chester-based private-hire firm that operates under the brand name, KingKabs. With the addition of this £7.25 million acquisition, CityFleet Networks is expected to deliver over 5 million taxi and private-hire trips to the region's residents and tourists each year.

As the taxi industry steadily bounced back from the COVID-19 pandemic and in-office work arrangements returned to normal, the demand from corporate customers grew and, conversely, the demand from non-corporate customers cooled down. The companies also continued to face stiff competition from other private-hire companies.

To attract more passenger bookings, the companies encouraged customers to download their apps by offering promo codes, which customers can use to offset their rides. Throughout the year, more than £5,000 worth of promo codes were given out and, as a result, the number of app downloads increased by 20% as compared to 2022.

As the shortage of drivers remained a key challenge that plagues the industry, various schemes continued to be rolled out to recruit and retain drivers, which included flexible subscription commissions and peak hour incentive schemes, enabling CityFleet Networks to achieve its driver-to-fleet target.

# SCOTLAND

# COACH

Scottish Citylink Coaches, a joint venture with Stagecoach, is the leading provider of express coach services in Scotland with 170 coaches under the 'Scottish Citylink' and 'megabus.com' and Falcon brands. It also operates a network of cross-border services between Scotland and major cities in England.

Stagecoach owns  $37.5\%$  of Scottish Citylink Coaches while our subsidiary, Braddell, holds the remaining  $62.5\%$ .

With the ongoing rail strikes in the UK in 2023, demand for coach services remained strong as many commuters switched to travel by coach. On top of that, the continued expansion of the Young Persons' (Under 22s) concession scheme which provided free bus travel to those aged below 22 also attributed to high demand during the year.

In the face of intensified competition impacting its cross-border services in Scotland, Megabus's pricing were marginally reduced to maintain its market share. In other cities within England, such as between Bristol and London, its pricing were also adjusted to ensure the Company maintained presence in this key corridor.

To improve customer experience, further enhancement and development of its website introduced new features such as a journey planner, automatic trip connector and an interactive map which allows patrons to track their journeys in real-time.

To improve customer experience, further enhancement and development of its website was made to introduce new features such as a journey planner, automatic trip connector and an interactive map which allows patrons to track their journeys in real-time. This resulted in an impressive  $17 \%$ lead conversion rate for its website.

On operations, Scottish Citylink Coaches continued to wrestle with the issue of driver recruitment and retention. To overcome this challenge, it worked closely with its subcontractors to effectively allocate resources at the depot to fulfil its schedule. The Company also addressed the issue of vehicle schedule reliability by putting in place contingency vehicle replacement plans and ensuring key routes are covered by third-party coach operators in the event a scheduled coach becomes unavailable.

# ABERDEEN

# TAXI RADIO CIRCUIT AND PRIVATE CAR HIRE

Computer Cab (Aberdeen) has the second largest fleet in Aberdeen with a total of 128 taxis and private-hire vehicles.

With the resurgence of post-pandemic domestic and international travel during the year, the Company saw a larger demand and a  $10\%$  increase in passenger trips.

Shortage of drivers remained difficult to overcome, as new drivers are required by the Aberdeen City Council to pass a street knowledge test before they can be onboarded. To mitigate this challenge, the Company started a training school to coach new drivers in March 2022. Since then, the uptake rate has been consistent and 16 drivers have successfully completed the six to nine month long training and passed the knowledge test.

To better manage the existing pool of drivers in its fleet, the Company continued to help cabbies by optimising routes and allocating rides more efficiently through its Autocab booking and despatch system. Incentive programmes were also kickstarted to attract more drivers to work during the weekends to meet passenger demand.

# WALES

# CARDIFF

# BUS AND COACH

Adventure Travel operates a fleet of 150 buses and coaches across three depots in Cardiff, Taff's Well and Swansea.

The overall demand improved during the year, although passenger figures were about  $90\%$  of pre-COVID levels. Its private-hire coach services experienced strong demand, while the demand for passenger bus services has fallen behind as compared to pre-COVID levels. Due to tightened funding from the Welsh Government, a small number of bus routes were then curtailed in July 2023.

With the frequent traffic congestion and reduced speed limits in Wales, several bus schedule adjustments were made to accommodate longer journey times so buses could promptly complete their schedules and meet the stringent bus punctuality standards set out by the traffic commissioners.

During the year, the Company successfully retained most of its existing contracts and secured six new school bus service contracts. As more private-hire coaches were expected to comply with the Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations (PSVAR) in the UK, Adventure Travel converted four coaches in its fleet to be PSVAR-compliant by fitting wheelchair lifts and digital destination equipment.

A shortage of drivers continued to pose a problem for the Company and the sector at large. To recruit more drivers, marketing campaigns were rolled out to reach out to new groups of potential drivers, and the training for recruits was bolstered as well.

Staff engagement activities such as the healthy eating campaign, 'Fruit Friday', were launched during the year to promote good nutrition and a healthy lifestyle for the benefit of its employees.

# INTER-CITY EXPRESS COACH

ComfortDelGro Irish Citylink Limited, our wholly-owned express coach subsidiary in Ireland, runs a network of inter-city and Dublin Airport express routes linking cities such as Cork, Dublin, Galway and Limerick.

ComfortDelGro Irish Citylink experienced significant ridership growth in 2023, finishing the year with an average of 40,000 passengers weekly, a  $26 \%$ increase compared to 2022. This growth was driven by two key factors: the strategic acquisition of GoBus coach service operator Evobus and Coach Limited in 2022, which expanded the network and attracted new passengers, as well as the easing of travel restrictions post- pandemic, which drove the return of tourists as well as commuters

going to work and school. With fuel and living costs on the rise, coach travel also saw a surge in popularity due to its affordability. ComfortDelGro Irish Citylink capitalised on this by reintroducing all pre-pandemic services and expanding its network with new services on the Galway Express, Limerick Express and Clifden corridor as well as the introduction of the new Castlebar (Mayo) to Dublin route, offering enhanced connectivity and convenient travel options between cities on these new services.

During the year, a streamlined online booking engine was developed, offering a simpler way to book travel. Additionally, ComfortDelGro Irish Citylink and GoBus services were brought together on one platform,

providing passengers with greater choice. The first phase of the booking engine was launched in November 2023 and the mobile app "My CityLink" is expected to be ready by the first quarter of 2024.

ComfortDelGro Irish Citylink also achieved remarkable success at the World Passenger Festival Awards 2023, outshining 135 other operators from 35 countries. The Company was awarded the prestigious Best Bus Award, recognising its excellence in providing bus services across various networks, including inter-city, urban, and rural routes. Furthermore, it received the Best Operator Award for achieving the highest level of passenger satisfaction across all its service areas.

# BEIJING

# TAXI

Beijing Jin Jian Taxi Service Co., Ltd, is the capital city's third largest taxi operator with a total fleet of over 4,500 taxis, equating to  $10.5\%$  total market share. During the year, the Company converted a total of 2,047 taxis in its fleet to electric ones.

Passenger demand remained relatively stable, although demand from tourist and business travellers experienced slower recovery due to the lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The market also remained highly competitive, partly due to the increased presence of illegal taxis in Beijing.

To maximise fleet utilisation, the Company continued to lease out its private-hire vehicles to platforms such as Didi Chuxing Technology Co. and CaoCao Mobility to generate higher revenue. It also continued to partner with Alibaba-backed AutoNavi or

Gaode AMap, a navigation mobile App that flags out hotspots within the city, to increase booking jobs for its cabbies.

# JILIN CITY, JILIN PROVINCE

# TAXI

Our  $97 \%$ –owned subsidiary, Jilin ComfortDelGro Taxi Co., Ltd, is the City’s largest taxi operator with a fleet of over 700 taxis, translating to a  $14.3 \%$ market share. Within its fleet, nearly 200 taxis are electric.

As the market had yet to fully stabilise during the year, cabbies' income remained a concern. To support these cabbies, the Company continued to extend its monthly taxi rental waiver in January 2023.

In line with the Government's efforts to scale up electrification, the Company also continued to deploy and expand its electric taxi fleet. As of end 2023, it has rolled out 190 Hongqi EQM5 battery-swapping e-taxis, which allow cabbies to swiftly swap used batteries with new ones at any of the five battery-swapping stations in Jilin City. The Hongqi e-taxis provided a comparatively lower operating cost than traditional taxis and were well received by cabbies and passengers alike.

# SHENYANG, LIAONING PROVINCE

# TAXI

The Group operates a combined fleet of over 1,500 taxis in Shenyang in 2023 through Shenyang ComfortDelGro Taxi Co., Ltd and CityCab (Shenyang) Co., Ltd, making ComfortDelGro the largest taxi operator in the city.

With the gradual recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and accelerated development of the city's public transportation system like the Shenyang Metro, the overall taxi demand declined

in 2023. As a result, retaining drivers became a challenge with many cabbies choosing to switch jobs due to the low demand and low drivers' income.

To mitigate the situation, the companies monitored the market closely and made timely adjustments to drivers' payment so more vehicles could be hired out to improve revenue flow. To attract more drivers to join, the Company offered taxi models with competitive rental rates.

During the year, both companies continued to focus on driver training to improve the service levels. As a result, a total of 77 taxis were selected as Shenyang Model Taxis and 374 cabbies were selected as Star Drivers by Shenyang Transportation Bureau for their exemplary service.

# TAXI

Our wholly owned subsidiary, Chengdu ComfortDelGro Taxi Co., Ltd is the second largest taxi operator with a fleet size of over 1,000 vehicles, translating to a  $7.13\%$  market share.

In 2023, the Company continued to face stiff competition caused by the proliferation of the ride-hailing services and rental rates reduction by other taxi operators in the city. Nevertheless, there was an uptick in demand as the tourism sector steadily recovered due to the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions.

To attract new drivers and retain existing ones, referral incentives continued to be extended to cabbies when they successfully recruited other cabbies to come onboard the Company. It also continued its wellreceived taxi self-maintenance scheme, which gives cabbies the autonomy to manage their own vehicle's maintenance costs to bring down their daily rental.

Shanghai City Qi Ai Taxi Services Co., Ltd is one of the premium taxi operators in Shanghai with a fleet of over 300 taxis. Out of these, about 190 are electric taxis.

![](images/eed4d2dd037be3e5eaa6e17983085b2fff7892898c00b96454c5bb3ea8eb8829.jpg)

New regulations implemented in 2021 allowed non-locals to take up taxi driving in the City, but the service standards remained a challenge for these new drivers. Training focused on service competence as well as vehicle inspection was therefore regularly conducted for its drivers to ensure passengers get a safe and pleasant experience on board their taxis.

# SUZHOU, JIANGSU PROVINCE

# TAXI

Our  $70 \%$ –owned subsidiary, Suzhou Comfort Taxi Co., Ltd, operates a fleet of over 30 taxis, of which 12 are electric. During the year, the Company was awarded a government incentive for introducing electric taxis in the city, and for maintaining high safety and service standards during the pandemic months.

# NANJING, JIANGSU PROVINCE

# TAXI

Our  $70 \%$  -owned subsidiary, Nanjing ComfortDelGro Dajian Taxi Co., Ltd, is the City’s third largest taxi company, with a fleet size of close to 450 taxis.

In 2023, the market continued to be impacted by COVID-19, and reduced driver earnings caused many cabbies to leave the industry. As such, taxi operators in the city lowered their rental rates to compete for drivers. To address these pain points, the Company focused its resources on the recruitment and retention of cabbies, drivers' welfare as well as its fleet and rental management.

As part of its early conversion programme launched in mid-2022, over  $74\%$  of its fleet successfully converted from internal combustion engines to electric taxis. To help cabbies lower operating costs and boost income, the Company also worked towards securing preferential charging rates with electric vehicle charging operators during the year.

# SOUTH CHINA

# GUANGZHOU, GUANGDONG PROVINCE

# BUS STATION

Our  $60\%$  -owned Tianhe Bus Station in Guangzhou, in joint partnership with Guangzhou Public Transport Group (GZPTG), served a total of 133,200 bus trips and 1.59 million passengers in 2023, which was a  $23.3\%$  increase in number of passengers as compared to 2022. The Station continued to rank second of nine stations in Guangzhou with a market share of about  $30\%$  in ridership and  $26\%$  in bus trips.

During the year, the station experienced competition due to increased government support for point-to-point inter-city travel, high-speed rail development, as well as the continued surge in popularity of ride-hailing. It also faced fierce competition from other bus chartering service providers which offered low-fare tickets on digital platforms, as opposed to the traditional ticketing system.

To mitigate the impact, the Company expanded nine additional satellite bus stops for our bus operators to access their dispatch system through its digital platform, instead of having to return to designated terminals. This helped to increase bus service volume and ridership. To meet the demand for more point-to-point destination journeys, the Company also converted 27 terminal-to-terminal bus routes to point-to-point routes.

Revenue from its WeChat tour platform — Xin Tian Wei Tour App — reached RMB 6.37 million with 310,000 new registered users during the year. Launched in January 2022, the platform actively promoted bus tours together with services such as accommodation, attraction tickets and tourist travel passes. Due to its success, the Company partnered with an additional 31 tour agencies to cover more routes and better cater to popular tourist destinations for its passengers.

The construction sector largely remained weak during the year. To generate additional revenue, the Company provided fleet management service to third-party concrete logistics companies from October 2023 to help deploy their fleet for construction work. Furthermore, the Company also took steps to reduce the fuel consumption of its fleet.

# RAIL

Auckland One Rail (AOR), which operates New Zealand's largest metro system, is a 50:50 partnership with UGL Rail Services, an Australian rail operations and maintenance company under the CIMIC Group.

Auckland Metro comprises four lines representing 94km of rail network, 40 stations and 72 three-car electric multiple-unit trains. It currently provides about 3,200 scheduled train services each week.

Ridership growth in 2023 was hampered by extensive disruptions on the rail network, including the 'Rail Network Rebuild,' a KiwiRail infrastructure upgrade and maintenance programme. This programme led to the complete closure

of the Eastern Line for nine months in 2023, with a bus rail replacement service operating instead. Furthermore, Auckland experienced some extreme weather events in 2023, particularly in the first quarter, which significantly disrupted travel, causing line closures and speed restrictions. Despite these challenges, ridership for the year was just over 12 million, compared to 9.5 million in 2022, an increase of approximately  $26\%$ .

In April 2023, the Company implemented an Operational Dashboard, accessible to all drivers, train managers, and Train Operations Centre employees, to facilitate communication of operational changes during disruptions, such as cancelled services, frequency adjustments, and network availability updates.

The Company also launched its 'Voice of the Customer' dashboard in April 2023, which provides employees with the trends on all key customer metrics. It also conducts a quarterly review with the Auckland transport authority of all customer trends and key initiatives to ensure that the Company focuses on improving the areas of service important to its customers.

During the year, AOR conducted four customer focus groups to gain a deeper insight into customer needs and how to address them. These focus groups discussed Rail Network Rebuild line closure communications, delay and disruption notification and communication, and various Accessible Action Plan initiatives with accessibility and mobility-impaired customers.

(i) Providing entrepreneurial leadership and guidance, setting strategic directions and objectives of the Group (which include appropriate focus on value creation, innovation and sustainability) and ensuring that adequate financial and human resources are in place to achieve the objectives;  
(ii) Ensuring that appropriate and adequate systems of internal control, risk management processes and financial authority limits are in place to safeguard shareholders' interests and the Group's assets, and to achieve an appropriate balance between exposure to risks and the Group's performance;

(iii) Challenging Management constructively and reviewing its performance;  
(iv) Identifying the key stakeholder groups and guiding Management in the Group's strategy and approach in addressing the concerns of these key stakeholder groups, and ensuring transparency and accountability to all stakeholders;  
(v) Instilling an ethical corporate culture and ensuring the Group's values, standards, policies and practices are consistent with the Group's culture; and  
(vi) Considering environmental, social and governance ("ESG") issues as an integral part of its strategy for sustainability.

# 1.1 CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

All Directors are required to avoid situations where their own personal or business interests may conflict or appear to conflict with the interests of the Group. In the event that a Director has a conflict of interest, or it appears that he/she may have a conflict of interest in relation to any matter, the Director must immediately declare his/her interest at a meeting of the Board or send a written notice to the Board and the Company containing details of his/her interest in the matter and the actual or potential conflict, and recuse himself/ herself from participating in any discussion or decision on the matter. In the case of any matter where the Chairman is conflicted, such as his remuneration or reelection as a Director, he will similarly recuse himself from participating in the discussion, and the other Directors will elect someone among themselves to preside over the discussion and to lead the Directors in decision making.

# 1.2 DIRECTORS' COMPETENCIES, INDUCTION, TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT

Upon appointment, the Director will be issued an official letter of appointment, which clearly sets out his/her roles, duties and responsibilities and the Company's expectations of him/her as a Director of the Company. The new Director will also receive a copy of the Company's Constitution, the Company's current and previous years' Annual Reports and the corporate structure chart of the Group.

The Management will conduct a comprehensive orientation programme for newly appointed Directors, which covers, amongst other matters, duties as a Director and how to discharge those duties and key

aspects of the Group's businesses, including financial and corporate governance policies. Site visits will also be arranged for new Directors so that they can better familiarise themselves with the Group's operations. When a Director is appointed to a Board Committee, he/she is provided with a copy of the relevant Board Committee's terms of reference.

If the newly appointed Director has no prior experience as a Director of a company listed on the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited ("SGX-ST"), training in relevant areas such as regulatory, finance and legal, as well as industry-related areas will be provided. As required under the SGX-ST Listing Manual, a newly appointed Director who has no prior experience as a Director of a company listed on the SGX-ST must undergo training as prescribed by the SGX-ST. Such training should be completed within one year of appointment. In this respect, all our newly appointed Directors who are required to undergo such training conscientiously commit their time and effort to complete the training within the first year of appointment.

Directors are encouraged to undergo continual professional development by attending relevant training programmes, seminars and courses organised by the Singapore Institute of Directors ("SID") and other professional bodies to enhance their knowledge and skills, and better equip themselves to effectively discharge their duties as a Director of the Company. The fees for the courses are paid for by the Company. The Chairman and the Nominating and Remuneration Committee review each Director's training and professional development needs on an annual basis.

The Company Secretary updates and briefs the Board on corporate governance practices and changes in or updates to the relevant legal and regulatory requirements pertaining to the Group's businesses. External consultants are also invited to conduct seminars on specific topics as and when necessary. In FY2023, Rajah and Tann Singapore LLP conducted several seminars including seminars on the Approved Code of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' Workplace Safety and Health ("WSH") Duties ("COP") and the Strategic Role of Directors of Holding Companies and Subsidiaries. In addition, the Company constantly encourages and sponsors Directors to attend training conducted externally, particularly with regards to new developments. One such programme was the Singapore Exchange ("SGX") training on Climate Reporting Fundamentals held in 2023.

Regular presentations are made by the Management to the Board to enable the Directors to better familiarise themselves with the Group's businesses. Site visits for the Board are also organised from time to time to enable the Directors to learn more about the Group's operations. During such visits, the Directors spend time with the Management and/or business unit leaders to discuss new developments in the market, key strategies and policies pertaining to not just Company-specific operations but also the Group's businesses in general. The Directors also find time to interact with the Group's employees locally and overseas, to appreciate their perspective of the operations and business, as well as to listen to their aspirations and feedback on how to improve operational processes. Such meetings and interactions help the Directors to be better equipped to make informed decisions relating to the future direction of the Group. The Group also holds strategy meetings at least once every two (2) years for the Board to collaborate with the Management in developing the Group's future plans and proposals for new business opportunities. The latest such strategy meeting was held on 7 July 2023.

# 1.3 RESERVED MATTERS

ComfortDelGro has adopted clear, established, and documented internal guidelines for matters which require the Board's approval. Under these guidelines, Board approval is required with regard to matters such as acquisition of businesses, disposals of or changes in equity interests in existing subsidiaries/ associates, investment in financial instruments, tender for businesses above prescribed limits, assessing and approving key business decisions, funding and investment initiatives and other corporate actions, including approval of the financial authority limits, annual budget and capital expenditure and the release of financial results to the SGX-ST via SGXNET. In addition, the acceptance of credit facilities from banks, the establishment of capital market programmes and the issuance of debt instruments and guarantees including the granting of any security or charges also require the approval of the Board.

The Board periodically reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls, risk management

and financial authority limits to ensure that, while there is delegation of authority and empowerment, there are sufficient checks and balances in place to monitor compliance with delegated limits.

# 1.4 DELEGATION BY THE BOARD

To assist the Board in the detailed consideration of the various issues at hand and to facilitate decision making, five (5) Board Committees were established, namely, the Audit and Risk Committee ("ARC"), the Nominating and Remuneration Committee ("NRC"), the Investment Committee ("IC"), the Digitalisation Committee ("DC") and the Sustainability Committee ("SC") (collectively, the "Board Committees").

Each Board Committee is governed and regulated by its own terms of reference, which sets out the scope of its authority, duties and responsibilities, as well as the regulations and procedures governing the manner in which the Board Committee operates and how decisions are taken.

The terms of reference and summary of the activities of the ARC and NRC are described in further detail in the relevant sections below from page 65 and pages 74 to 75.

Ad hoc committees are also formed to look at specific issues from time to time. In August 2023, Mr Greaves convened an ad hoc Committee which was named the Corporate Governance Review Group (the "Review Group") to review the composition of the Board Committees and their respective terms of reference and other matters relating to ensuring that the Group's practices were aligned and in compliance with the 2018 Code, SGX-ST Listing Manual and the Companies Act 1967 of Singapore (the "Companies Act"). The Chairman presided over the Review Group which comprised the Deputy Chairman, Mr Choi Shing Kwok, the Chairman of the ARC, Mr Lee Jee Cheng Philip and Ms Susan Kong Yim Pui. The Review Group was discontinued after it completed its review of the corporate governance matters that it was tasked with and made its recommendations to the Board for adoption.

# INVESTMENT COMMITTEE

The IC's terms of reference are to assist the Board to review and recommend investment strategies and opportunities to deliver steady and sustainable results through growth in the Company's business. The IC monitors the economic landscapes and opportunities and guides the Group towards the longer-term strategy of expanding into new growth avenues by leveraging on its core strengths, in bus and rail business over and above the private mobility business. The IC is typically chaired by the Chairman of the Board. Mr Greaves took over the chair of the IC on the retirement of Mr Lim Jit Poh on 28 April 2023. The IC is authorised to approve transactions within its delegated authority limit in relation to acquisitions and investments within the scope of existing and approved business as well as

any divestment of existing businesses. The roles and responsibilities of the IC include inter alia:

(i) Provide entrepreneurial leadership and guidance in developing strategic direction for business growth;  
(ii) Review and recommend to the Board new scope of business to be undertaken by the Company for approval;  
(iii) Review potential investments, mergers, acquisitions and divestments of businesses and other assets of the Group; and  
(iv) Review and approve transactions within its delegated authority in relation to acquisitions and investments within the scope of existing and approved businesses and divestment of existing businesses.

Pursuant to the recommendations of the Review Group and the members of the IC, and upon the approval of the Board, the IC updated its Terms of Reference to include the oversight of the implementation of the Corporate Strategy and Plans as approved by the Board in August 2023. The updated Terms of Reference include oversight of technology-related investments so as to streamline the Board Committee's oversight of the implementation of the Corporate Strategy and Plans of the Group. The name of the IC was consequently changed to "Strategy & Investment Committee" ("SIC") with effect from 1 January 2024.

# DIGITALISATION COMMITTEE

The DC was formed with specific terms of reference to assist the Board to oversee its group-wide digital strategy and associated execution plans to ensure that the Group leverages on digitalisation as the catalyst for its strategic and business transformation agenda. The DC has been pivotal in the implementation of several significant projects aimed at ensuring better engagement with our customers across the Group and these included the Customer Relationship Management system and the CDG Zig booking app. Professor Ooi Beng Chin took over the chair from Ms Tham Ee Mern Lilian with effect from 1 January 2023. The roles and responsibilities of the DC included:

(i) Oversee the development of digitalisation strategies and roadmaps, including development of associated data architecture and technology strategy across the Group;  
(ii) Support the enablement of a new digital culture that will encourage and promote disruptive innovation in the Group;  
(iii) Review the requirements and plans for digital talent and expertise across the Group;

(iv) Identify and offer insights into new opportunities and trends;  
(v) Advise on initiatives in the context of the overall portfolio of digital investments and to align them with a person-centred digital future (sustaining innovation); and  
(vi) Create links with appropriate external advisors and communities to share information and best practices with regard to the use of digital technology.

The Board decided to dissolve the DC with effect from 1 January 2024 as it was satisfied that the digitalisation initiatives had been integrated into the Group's operations and Management could continue to drive the operational and transformational initiatives with oversight from the Board, while the review of strategic technology-related investments would be streamlined under the SIC.

# SUSTAINABILITY COMMITTEE

The SC assists the Board in fulfilling its corporate governance responsibilities in relation to the Group's sustainability policies and strategies by providing directions and considering ESG issues as part of its strategic formulation and investments. The SC seeks to integrate sustainability considerations in the business strategies of the Group to deliver steady and sustainable outcomes.

The Company had been included in the prestigious Dow Jones Sustainability Asia Pacific Index (DJSI Asia Pacific). ComfortDelGro is one of five Singapore companies, and the only one in the transport sector, listed in the 13-year-old regional index, which is the undisputed gold standard in sustainability benchmarking. More specifically, the Company was rewarded for its performance in the areas of Materiality, Climate Strategy, Stakeholder Engagement, Business Ethics, Emissions, Information Security, Human Capital Development, Resource Efficiency and Circularity, Labour Practice Indicators and Privacy Protection. The Chairperson of the SC is Ms Jessica Cheam. The key terms of reference of the SC include the following:

(i) Oversee the development, and review and monitor the performance of the Group's sustainability strategy, including materiality assessment and alignment of sustainable development policies with applicable laws and regulations;  
(ii) Review and monitor Management's commitment and allocation of resources to achieve the desired outcomes of the Group's sustainability strategy;  
(iii) Establish sustainability policies and practices, set and assess ESG targets, and measure the performance against targets, risks and opportunities;

(iv) Ensure the Group's sustainability policies, strategies and priorities are integrated into the Group's strategic plans, investment strategy and business goals;  
(v) Monitor and consider emerging key ESG trends and issues that may have strategic, business, and reputational implications for the Group, and receive periodic reports from the Management or external parties on the same, and make recommendations to the Board as necessary; and  
(vi) Assist the Board in fulfilling its corporate governance responsibilities and legal obligations in relation to the Group's performance, practices, strategies and policies for workplace safety and health of its employees, contractors, customers, and others affected by its activities, including its obligations under the Workplace Safety and Health Act 2006, the COP and other relevant legislation and regulations.

The SC also oversees Workplace, Safety and Health Policy matters, the details of which is on page 81.

Although the Board Committees are empowered to make their own decisions, the Board is ultimately responsible for all decisions made by the Board Committees.

# 1.5 DIRECTORS' ATTENDANCE AT BOARD AND BOARD COMMITTEE MEETINGS

At least five (5) scheduled Board Meetings are held every year at regular intervals for the purpose of reviewing the results and ongoing performance of the Group, notwithstanding that the financial results are only announced semi-annually. The Board Meetings to approve the half-year financial results are held within forty-five (45) days after the end of the first half of the financial year, and not later than sixty (60) days after the end of the financial year for the full-year financial results, while the Board Meeting to approve the annual budget is held in the last quarter of each year after all the budgets of the subsidiaries have been approved by their respective Boards. Ad-hoc Board and Board Committee Meetings are also held from time to time when the need arises.

Directors who are unable to attend meetings in person can participate in the discussions through video, audio, or tele-conferencing. Decisions of the Board and Board Committees on matters in the ordinary course of business may also be obtained via circular resolutions. Directors are free to seek clarifications and explanations from Management on the reports and papers submitted to the Board and Board Committees.

# 1.6 ACCESS TO INFORMATION

Prior to each Board and Board Committee Meeting, and where needed, the Management provides the Directors complete, adequate and timely information to enable them to make informed decisions and discharge their duties and responsibilities. The Board also receives monthly management accounts, updates on key performance indicators and quarterly Investor Relations ("IR") Reports covering IR activities, and updates of analysts and investors views and comments. This enables the Board to make informed and sound business decisions and to keep abreast of key challenges, opportunities and developments for the Group. As a general rule, reports to the Board and Board Committees are disseminated to Directors prior to meetings to provide sufficient time for review and consideration, so that discussions at the meetings are productive and effective. All information is encrypted if distributed electronically.

# 1.7 INDEPENDENT PROFESSIONAL ADVICE

Directors can request for additional information and have full access to Management. Management provides information requested by Directors for their meetings and decision making in a timely manner. Should there be a need to obtain independent professional advice on matters relating to the businesses of the Group or issues affecting the duties of the Directors, the Company will arrange for the appointment of relevant professional advisers at cost to the Company.

# 1.8 COMPANY SECRETARY

The Company Secretary assists in organising the Board and Board Committee Meetings and prepares the agenda in consultation with the Chairman, Managing Director/Group Chief Executive Officer ("MD/GCEO") and the chairpersons of the respective Board Committees. The Company Secretary attends all Board and Board Committee Meetings. The Company Secretary keeps the Directors informed of any significant developments or events relating to the Group, including updates on all relevant rules and regulations. The Directors have separate and independent access to the Company Secretary. The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is subject to the approval of the Board. A second Company Secretary was appointed on 1 January 2024 to provide stronger support to the Board and assist the Company in enhancing corporate governance and compliance for the Group.

# PRINCIPLE 2: BOARD COMPOSITION AND GUIDANCE

# BOARD COMPOSITION

The Company has consistently met or exceeded the minimum requirements of the 2018 Code and Rule 210(5) (c) of the SGX-ST Listing Manual by ensuring that at least one third of the Board is independent and the majority is nonexecutive. As of 31 December 2023, the Board comprised

ten (10) Directors with  $90\%$  of the Board being Independent Directors ("IDs"). Except for the MD/GCEO who is an Executive Director, all the remaining nine (9) Non-Executive Directors ("NEDs") are also duly considered by the NRC to be independent.

Mr Lim Jit Poh, the former Chairman of the Board, and Ms Sum Wai Fun Adeline who retired as Directors of the Company at the conclusion of the last AGM held on 28 April 2023 were also deemed to be independent by the NRC, having been re-elected at the 2021 AGM in accordance with the now-defunct Rule 210(5)(d)(iii) of the SGX-ST Listing Manual. Mr Tan Peng Hoe, Steve was appointed an Independent NED of the Company on 28 April 2023. As at the date of this report, nine out of ten (10) Directors are Independent Directors. There is no person who will be able to influence any decision of the Board as the Independent NEDs continue to be the majority.

# 2.1 INDEPENDENT JUDGEMENT

All Directors are aware of their fiduciary duties and exercise due diligence and independent judgement in ensuring that their decisions are objective and in the best interests of the Company and its Group.

In accordance with Regulation 104 of the Company's Constitution, no Director may vote in respect of any transaction or proposed transaction with the Company in which he/she has an interest or in respect of any matter arising from such transaction or proposed transaction. Each Director makes it a point to declare to the Board should he/she have any interest in the subject matter before any discussion or decision-making process and recuse himself/herself therefrom to avoid any compromise in the Board's objectivity, in its judgement or decision-making.

The Board's practices in relation to conflicts of interest are set out in the section "Conflicts of Interest" on page 55 above.

# 2.2 INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS

As mentioned above, as at 31 December 2023, Independent Directors made up  $90\%$  of the Board.

The Board composition, whether during FY2023 or as at 1 January 2024, exceeds the requirement under the SGX-ST Listing Manual and the 2018 Code that at least one third of the Board must be Independent Directors. It is also noted that the Chairman, Deputy Chairman and MD/GCEO are different persons and are not immediate family members, and the Chairman and Deputy Chairman are not part of the Management team. No person will be able to influence the decisions of the Board as the overwhelming majority of the Directors are Independent NEDs. There is a strong level of independence on the Board.

The NRC is responsible for assessing the independence of the Directors on an annual basis. Each Director is required to complete a Confirmation of Independence checklist which is drawn up in accordance with the guidelines provided in the 2018 Code and requires each Director to assess his/her own independence. Each Director is required to declare any circumstances in which he/she may be considered non-independent. The NRC will then review the Confirmation of Independence to determine whether a Director is independent. The NRC deems a Director who is associated with a substantial shareholder in the current and immediate past financial year as non-independent.

In determining the independence of a Director with less than 9 years of service, the Board and NRC take a holistic approach, taking into consideration various factors such as whether the Director has any interest, business, relationship and/or any other material contractual relationship with the Group which could compromise or reasonably be perceived to compromise his/her independence and interfere with the exercise of his/her independent business judgement. Except where SGX-ST Listing Rule 210(5)(d)(iv) which states that a Director will not be independent if he/she has been a Director of the issuer for an aggregate period of more than nine years (whether before or after listing) applies, the length of service is not a critical factor in determining the independence of any Director, but it should nevertheless remain one of the factors in considering Directors' independence. The Board is of the view that all Independent Directors remain independent in the exercise of their judgement on Board matters. SGX-ST Listing Rule 210(5)(d)(iv) does not apply to any of the Directors currently in office.

The NRC will continue to review the independence of the Directors of the Company on an annual basis, and as and when material circumstances change.

# 2.3 NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS

As at 31 December 2023, the Board comprised ten (10) Directors with  $90\%$  of the Board being Independent Non-Executive Directors. The Independent NEDs are led by the Independent Non-Executive Chairman of the Board.

# 2.4 BOARD SIZE, COMPOSITION, DIVERSITY AND COMPETENCY

The NRC examines the size and composition of the Board and the Board Committees annually to ensure an appropriate balance and mix of skills, knowledge, experience and other aspects of diversity such as gender, age, nationality and ethnicity, and that the size is conducive for effective discussion and decision making, with an appropriate number of Independent Directors. The NRC also takes into consideration the promotion of tripartism experience from labour, government and

business, to foster constructive debate and enhance the Board's ability to discharge its duties and responsibilities effectively.

The bulk of the Group's businesses is regulated. Having considered the scope and nature of the operations of the Group and the requirements of its businesses, the NRC and the Board are of the view that the current Board size of ten (10) Directors is appropriate.

The Group is committed to building an open, inclusive and collaborative culture and recognises the importance of all aspects of diversity in supporting the achievement of its strategic objectives, growth and sustainable development.

# BOARD DIVERSITY POLICY

The Company has adopted a Board Diversity Policy since 2019, which seeks to ensure an appropriate balance and mix of skills, knowledge, experience, age, gender, nationality, ethnicity and other aspects of diversity within the Board to avoid groupthink and bias, and instead foster constructive debate and achieve effective decision making in the best interests of the Group. Under the Board Diversity Policy, the NRC will discuss and agree annually on the relevant measurable targets for promoting and achieving diversity in the composition of the Board and Board Committees and make recommendations for consideration and approval by the Board.

In reviewing the Board composition and succession planning, the NRC considers various aspects of diversity, with all Board appointments and re-appointments based on merit, and due consideration being given to a candidate's suitability in strengthening the diversity of skills, experience, age, gender, knowledge and core competencies of the Board relevant to the Group. In relation to gender diversity, the Board ensures that female candidates are included for consideration when identifying suitable candidates for new appointments to the Board, and since 2022, the Board has adopted the guideline that at least one female Director sits on each Board Committee including the NRC. As at 31 December 2023, out of ten (10) directors on the Board, three (3) directors or  $30\%$  were females. In fact, there were at least two (2) female Directors on each of the Board Committees in FY2023. The Company has achieved the Board's target to have  $30\%$  female directors and has also exceeded the target of the Board Diversity Council to have at least  $25\%$  females on the Board by 2025.

The Directors are individuals with leadership experiences in business, government and the labour movement and have a broad diversity of expertise and experience including accounting, finance, legal, information technology, artificial intelligence, sustainability, and business management, both domestically and

internationally. In addition, the Board also comprises Directors of different nationalities and ethnicity. They bring with them different perspectives of the business, locally and internationally, especially in Australia and the United Kingdom where the Group invests heavily in. Each Director provides a valuable network of industry contacts and a resource of his/her knowledge of different legal and regulatory regimes and corporate governance practice. Board discussions are always constructive and multi-dimensional with little room for any biasness or groupthink.

The NRC is satisfied that the current Board and Board Committees comprise Directors who, as a group, provide an appropriate balance and diversity of skills, knowledge, experience, age, gender, nationality, ethnicity and core competencies required for the Board and Board Committees to discharge their responsibilities effectively and ensure that the Group continues to be able to meet the challenges and demands of the markets in which it operates.

Professor Ooi Beng Chin, Ms Tham Ee Mern Lilian and Ms Jessica Cheam are currently the longest-serving Independent Directors. Mr Tan Peng Hoe, Steve who was appointed an Independent Director of the Company on 28 April 2023 will be retiring from the Board at the coming AGM and being eligible, the NRC recommended him for re-appointment. All Independent Directors on the Board of the Company have a tenure of less than nine (9) years, with an average tenure of about 2.5 years and with the longest serving seven (7) years on the Board at the time of the coming AGM. The NRC and the Board review the size and composition of the Board annually to determine the optimal Board size and composition, with regards to the business and governance needs of the Group.

The Company sources for suitable candidates through the recommendations of the existing Directors, other contacts and a variety of independent sources which may include external consultants, to find the right match of potential candidates for the Company.

Nonetheless, the ultimate decision on selection of Directors will be based on merit against a set of objective criteria that complements and expands the talent, skills, knowledge, industry and business experience of the Board as a whole, and after giving due regard to the overall balance and effectiveness of a diverse Board to serve the needs of the Group.

The individual profiles of the Directors, their listed company directorships and principal commitments held currently and/or in the preceding five (5) years, are found in the "Board of Directors" and "Directors' Particulars" sections on pages 18 to 23 and pages 82 to 85 of this Annual Report.

# 2.5 NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' PARTICIPATION

In addition to the relevant monthly financial and business reports provided by the Management, the NEDs also have unrestricted access to the Management and the various business unit leaders to obtain up-to-date feedback and suggestions for improvement on any matter concerning business or governance. The NEDs participate actively at Board and Board Committee Meetings to constructively challenge Management and help develop proposals on business strategy and other business and governance issues.

The Board sets objectives and goals for the Management, monitors the results, and assesses and remunerates the Management in accordance with its performance. Executive Directors who are part of the Management may face a conflict of interest in these areas. To avoid any undue influence of the Management over the Board, the NEDs review the performance of the Management based on prescribed and agreed key performance indicators, goals and objectives, and ensure appropriate checks and balances are in place for the Board's independent assessment.

As of 31 December 2023, all the members of the ARC and NRC were Independent NEDs. There is no Executive Director appointed as a member of these Board Committees. However, the MD/GCEO is invited to attend the ARC and NRC meetings to provide feedback and emphasise the responsibilities placed on the Management.

The Independent Non-Executive Chairman, who is not a member of the ARC, meets with the Chairperson of the ARC and the External Auditors annually in the absence of the Management. The NEDs also meet regularly without the presence of the Management before or after Board Meetings. The Chairperson of such meetings provides feedback to the Board and/or the Chairman, as appropriate.

# PRINCIPLE 3: CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

# 3.1 CHAIRMAN AND MANAGING DIRECTOR/GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

The roles of the Chairman and the MD/GCEO are kept separate and distinct to ensure an appropriate balance of power, increased accountability, and greater capacity of the Board for independent decision making. This is a deliberate policy agreed by the Board and one that is strictly adhered to. This ensures Management accountability and Board independence.

# 3.2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF CHAIRMAN AND MD/GCEO

The responsibilities of the Chairman and the MD/GCEO are set out in writing. The Chairman is responsible for the effective functioning of the Board, and the MD/ GCEO for the operations and management of the Group's businesses. The Chairman and the MD/GCEO are not related.

# Roles and Responsibilities of the Chairman

# The Chairman:

(i) Leads the Board, facilitates effective contribution of all Directors, sets the agenda and promotes comprehensive, rigorous and open discussions at Board meetings among the Directors, as well as between the Board and Management;  
(ii) Oversees the translation of the Board's decisions into executive actions;  
(iii) Ensures adequacy and timeliness of information flow between the Board and Management and effective communication with shareholders and other stakeholders;  
(iv) Encourages constructive conversations and cordial relations within the Board, between the Board and Management and the Board and the MD/GCEO; and  
(v) Promotes high standards of corporate governance and transparency.

# Roles and Responsibilities of MD/GCEO

# The MD/GCEO:

The MD/GCEO is the highest-ranking executive in the Group. His primary responsibilities include making major corporate decisions, managing the overall operations and resources of the Group, and acting as the main point of communication between the Board and corporate operations. He is responsible for implementing the corporate strategy and is accountable to the Board for the Group's performance and for ensuring efficient allocation of capital across the Group. The MD/GCEO is also responsible for setting the example of leadership and creating a conducive environment towards a sustainable work culture that builds teams to succeed and attract talent. The MD/ GCEO also serves as the public face of the Group, engaging with the media and public relations.

The MD/GCEO is given full executive responsibility for the management of the Group's businesses and the implementation of the Group's strategies and policies as decided by the Board, and reports to the Board on a regular basis.

# 3.3 LEAD INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR

The appointment of a Lead Independent Director is not required as the Chairman is an independent Non-Executive Director. Moreover, the majority of the Board, including the Chairman, are independent Directors and none of them is part of the Management team or has a relationship with the MD/GCEO and his/her immediate family members. The Board on 28 April 2023 appointed Mr Choi Shing Kwok, an Independent NED, as the Deputy Chairman of the Board. The Deputy Chairman will step in as acting Chairman of the Board and preside over shareholder and Directors' meetings in the Chairman's absence, or where a motion of which the Chairman is personally interested or conflicted is being discussed. Further, the ARC Chairman is readily available to shareholders if they have concerns for which the normal channels of communication with the Chairman or Management may be inappropriate or inadequate. Any matter that may give rise to a potential conflict of interests is dealt with in accordance with the procedure as mentioned under "Conflicts of Interests" on page 55.

# 3.4 INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS COMMUNICATION

The Chairman and the MD/GCEO represent the Board at official functions and meetings with shareholders and other stakeholders such as employees, regulators and customers. A detailed description of our engagements with stakeholders can be found in our Sustainability Report.

# PRINCIPLE 4: BOARD MEMBERSHIP

There is a formal and transparent process for the appointment and re-appointment of Directors to the Board, taking into account the need for progressive renewal of the Board.

# 4.1 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE NOMINATING AND REMUNERATION COMMITTEE

In 2021, the Nominating Committee ("NC") and the Remuneration Committee ("RC") were merged to streamline their respective functions for greater efficiency in reviewing the appointment, performance and remuneration of Directors and the Key Management Personnel. Notwithstanding that the NC and RC were merged, the roles and responsibilities of the respective functions were not compromised and the Company continues to adhere to the principles of the 2018 Code in relation to the NC and the RC.

The NRC is responsible for (i) regularly reviewing the composition of the Board, identifying and proposing suitable candidates for appointment to the Board and ensuring succession plans are in place (the "NC Role"); and (ii) setting the framework for Directors' Fees and the Group's remuneration policies and framework for

Key Management Personnel (the "RC Role"). The details of the RC Role are found on pages 69 to 73 of this Annual Report.

# THE NC ROLE

The NRC ensures that the renewal of Board membership is an ongoing process to ensure good governance and maintain relevance in a changing business environment. All decisions by the NRC are made by a majority of votes of the NRC members who are present and voting. The key terms of reference of the NRC, in relation to nomination matters, include the following:

(i) Review the structure, size and composition of the Board;  
(ii) Review the succession plans for Directors, the talent management and succession plans for Key Management Personnel, and make recommendations to the Board on the appointment, replacement and re-appointment of Directors and Key Management Personnel, including the appointment and/or replacement of the Chairman and the MD/GCEO;  
(iii) Develop a process for performance evaluation of the Board, its Board Committees and individual Director's performance, including comparison with industry peers;  
(iv) Make recommendations to the Board on the review of training and professional development programmes for the Board and the Directors;  
(v) Assess the effectiveness of the Board and Board Committees and contributions by each individual Director; and  
(vi) Determine annually, and as and when circumstances require, if a Director is independent.

# 4.2 COMPOSITION OF THE NOMINATING AND REMUNERATION COMMITTEE

As at 31 December 2023, the NRC comprised six (6) independent NEDs. The composition of the NRC therefore complies with the requirement under the 2018 Code that specifies that the NC comprises at least three (3) Directors, the majority of whom, including the Chairman, are independent.

# 4.3 PROCESS FOR SELECTION, APPOINTMENT AND RE-APPOINTMENT OF DIRECTORS

As part of the Board succession plan, potential candidates may be identified from time to time for appointment to the Board after the NRC evaluates and assesses their suitability in strengthening the diversity of skills, experience, age, gender, knowledge and relevant core competencies of the Board, whilst ensuring that there is a balanced tripartism experience from government, labour and business to avoid unproductive groupthink and bias.

The process for selection of new Directors is as follows:

(i) The NRC assesses the desired competencies and attributes of the Board taking into account the Group's businesses and its strategic objectives as well as the need for diversity on the Board.  
(ii) The NRC then assesses the competencies and attributes to include into the current representation to achieve the desired mix. This forms the basis for selection of new Directors.  
(iii) New Directors are sourced through various channels, including recommendations of Directors and Management and if required, external search consultants.  
(iv) Potential candidates are interviewed by the NRC to assess suitability and commitment.  
(v) The NRC makes recommendations to the Board for approval.

The Constitution of the Company provides that one third of the Directors are subject to retirement and re-election by rotation at every AGM. All Directors are required to retire from office at least once every three (3) years. Re-election is, however, not automatic, and all Directors are assessed by the NRC on their competencies, commitment, past performance and contributions before being recommended to shareholders for re-election at the AGM. Newly appointed Directors are also subject to retirement and re-election at the AGM immediately following their appointments. At the forthcoming AGM, Professor Ooi Beng Chin, Ms Tham Ee Mern Lilian and Ms Jessica Cheam are due for re-election pursuant to Regulation 93 of the Company's Constitution.

Pursuant to Regulation 99 of the Constitution, newly appointed Directors will hold office until the next AGM and shall then be eligible for re-election. Accordingly, Mr Tan Peng Hoe, Steve, who was appointed on 28 April 2023, being eligible, will stand for re-election at the coming AGM.

# ALTERNATE DIRECTOR

Consistent with the 2018 Code, there are no alternate Directors on the Board.

# 4.4 REVIEW OF INDEPENDENCE

As of 31 December 2023, except for Mr Cheng Siak Kian who is the MD/GCEO of the Company and therefore, not an Independent Director, there was no Director who is deemed non-independent as set forth in Provision 2.1 of the 2018 Code and Rule 210(5)(d)(iv) of the SGX-ST Listing Manual.

The NRC has reviewed the independence of Professor Ooi Beng Chin and Ms Susan Kong Yim Pui and recommended to the Board that they continue to be deemed Independent Directors of the Company for the reasons set out below. The Board has concurred with the NRC's views.

# 1. Professor Ooi Beng Chin ("Professor Ooi")

(a) In the case of Professor Ooi, the NRC noted that Professor Ooi is a Non-Independent Non-Executive Director of VICOM Ltd ("VICOM"), a principal subsidiary of the Company. He was appointed to VICOM's board in 2023 to help enhance its competencies in the area of new technologies, big data management and digitalisation. The value of transactions between the Group (excluding VICOM and its subsidiaries) on the one hand and VICOM and its subsidiaries ("VICOM Group") on the other was in excess of S$200,000 for FY2023. All transactions were on an arm's length basis.  
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board concurred with the view and recommendation by the NRC that Professor Ooi remains an Independent Director of the Company for the following reasons:

(i) The value of transactions in FY2023 between the Group and the VICOM Group was not substantial in relation to the total revenue of the Group or the VICOM Group. Further, all transactions were on an arm's length basis;  
(ii) Professor Ooi would declare any conflict of interest and recuse himself from deliberating and voting on any matter that involves the VICOM Group;  
(iii) Professor Ooi's independence is reviewed annually or as and when necessary; and  
(iv) Professor Ooi is and has been acting in the best interests of the Company.

# 2. Ms Susan Kong Yim Pui ("Ms Kong")

(a) In the case of Ms Kong, the NRC noted that she is a Non-Independent Non-Executive Director of SBS Transit Ltd ("SBST"), a principal subsidiary of the Company. The value of transactions between the Group (excluding SBST and its subsidiaries) on the one hand and SBST and its subsidiaries ("SBST Group") on the other was in excess of S$200,000 for FY2023. All transactions were on an arm's length basis.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board concurred with the view and recommendation by the NRC that Ms Kong remains an Independent Director of the Company for the following reasons:

(i) The value of transactions in FY2023 between the Group and the SBST Group was not substantial in relation to the total revenue of the Group or the SBST Group. Further, the transactions were on an arm's length basis;  
(ii) Ms Kong would declare any conflict of interest and recuse herself from deliberating and voting on any matter that involves the SBST Group;  
(iii) Ms Kong's independence is reviewed annually or as and when necessary; and  
(iv) Ms Kong is and has been acting in the best interest of the Company.

# The NINE-YEAR RULE

In determining the independence of a Director with less than nine years of service, the NRC's approach has been a holistic one, taking into consideration various factors such as whether the Director has any interest, business, relationship and/or any other material contractual relationship with the Group which could compromise or reasonably be perceived to compromise his/her independence and interfere with the exercise of his/her independent business judgement. Except where SGX-ST Listing Rule 210(5)(d)(iv) applies, which states that a Director will not be independent if he/she has been a Director of the issuer for an aggregate period of more than nine years (whether before or after listing), the length of service is not a critical factor in determining the independence of any Director but it should nevertheless remain one of the factors in considering Directors' independence.

The NRC will continue to review the independence of the Directors of the Company on an annual basis, and as and when material circumstances change.

# 4.5 MULTIPLE DIRECTORSHPS AND PRINCIPAL COMMITMENTS

The NRC subscribes to the view that it is important for Directors to devote sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the Group. Consistent with the guidelines in the 2018 Code, the NRC and the Board have adopted the following as a proactive step to ensure this:

- A Director who is in full-time employment should not serve as a Director on the board of more than two (2) listed companies; and  
- A Director who is not in full-time employment should not serve as a Director on the board of more than five (5) listed companies.

Listed companies within a group should be considered as one (1) entity.

As the number of board representations should not be the only measure of a Director's commitment and ability to contribute effectively, the NRC takes the view that if a Director wishes to hold more board representations than the maximum stated in the guidelines, a request must be made to the Chairman of the Board for approval. As a policy, the Chairman himself should not hold more than five (5) directorships in listed companies if he is not in full-time employment and not more than two (2) directorships in listed companies if he is in full-time employment.

In assessing a Director's contribution, the NRC takes a holistic approach. Focusing solely on the Directors' attendance at the Board and Board Committee Meetings per se may not be an adequate evaluation of the contribution of the Directors. Instead, their ability to provide valuable insights and strategic networking to enhance the businesses of the Group, availability for guidance and advice outside the scope of formal Board and Board Committee Meetings and contributions in specialised areas are also relevant factors in assessing the contributions of the Directors.

As a policy, the MD/GCEO, being an Executive Director of the Company, besides adhering to the guidelines set on the maximum number of board representations on listed companies, will also have to seek the approval of the Chairman before accepting any directorships of companies not within the Group. In considering whether or not to grant the approval, the Chairman will consider the time commitment of the MD/GCEO and whether the new external directorships will provide strategic fit and networking for the businesses of the Group. The Chairman will also ensure that the MD/GCEO does not accept appointments to the boards of competitors.

As of 31 December 2023, all Directors complied with the guidelines on multiple board representation.

# 4.6 BOARD SUCESSION PLANNING

The NRC makes recommendations to the Board on the review of succession planning for Directors, in particular the Chairman and the MD/GCEO, as well as key management personnel ("KMP"), as follows:

(a) Long-term planning, to identify competencies needed for the Company's strategy and objectives;  
(b) Medium-term planning, for the orderly replacement of Board members and KMP: and  
(c) Contingency planning, for preparedness against sudden and unforeseen changes.

In relation to Directors, the NRC aims to maintain an optimal Board composition by considering the trends and factors affecting the long-term success of the Company, reviewing the skills needed, and identifying gaps, which includes considering whether there is an appropriate level of diversity of thought.

In relation to KMP succession, the NRC takes an active interest in the performance and management of key talent within the Group, including identifying strong candidates and developing them to take on senior positions in the future.

# 4.7 KEY INFORMATION ON DIRECTORS

The profiles and key information on the Directors are set out in this Annual Report from pages 18 to 23. The Notice of AGM presents the Directors proposed for re-election or re-appointment at the forthcoming AGM. Key information on Directors are also available on the Company's website.

# PRINCIPLE 5: BOARD PERFORMANCE

Each year, the Board undertakes a formal annual assessment of its effectiveness as a whole, and of each of its Board Committees and individual Directors.

# 5.1 BOARD PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

The NRC is delegated by the Board to undertake a process to assess the effectiveness of the Board in terms of overall performance and growth of the Group, achieving a reasonable return for shareholders, preventing conflicts of interest and balancing the competing demands of the Group. In evaluating the contributions and performance of each individual Director, factors taken into consideration include attendance at AGMs, Board and Board Committee Meetings and corporate activities, contributions in specialist areas and maintenance of independence. The performance criteria are determined by the NRC and approved by the Board, and do not change from year to year.

# 5.2 ANNUAL BOARD PERFORMANCE EVALUATION PROCESS

As part of the Company's digitalisation efforts and to increase efficiency in the collation of the yearly Board and Board Committees performance evaluation results, the Company has used a digital platform to enable the Directors to complete all the relevant performance evaluation forms electronically.

The following performance evaluation exercises were completed for FY2023:

(a) Individual Director Self-Assessment ("IDSA");  
(b) Board Committee Performance Evaluation for the ARC, NRC, IC, DC and SC; and  
(c) Board Performance Evaluation ("Board PE").

The procedures to complete the electronic performance evaluation are as follows:

# (a) Individual Director Self-Assessment

Each Director will complete an electronic IDSA Form. The Company Secretary will generate the report from the system and send it to the Chairman of the NRC and Board to review.

# (b) Board Committee Performance Evaluation for Audit and Risk Committee, Nominating and Remuneration Committee, Investment Committee, Digitalisation Committee and Sustainability Committee

The respective Board Committee members will complete the relevant electronic Board Committee performance evaluation forms. The Company Secretary will generate a summary of the respective Board Committee performance evaluation results for the relevant Chairperson to review. The final performance evaluation results of all the Board Committees will then be submitted to the NRC through the Company Secretary and subsequently to the Board for final endorsement.

# (c) Board Performance Evaluation

The NRC members are responsible for completing the electronic Board PE Form. The Company Secretary will generate a summary of the Board performance evaluation results for the NRC Chairman to review, before submitting to the Board for final endorsement.

In evaluating the performance of the Board, the NRC and the Board will take into account the results of the performance evaluation of the Board Committees.

The performance evaluation includes key points such as the Board composition and size, Board accountability, conduct of Board and Board Committee meetings, standards of conduct and whether the Directors have discharged their duties effectively.

# 2. REMUNERATION MATTERS

# PRINCIPLE 6: PROCEDURES FOR DEVELOPING REMUNERATION POLICIES

ComfortDelGro recognises the importance of having a skilled and dedicated workforce to manage and grow the businesses in an increasingly competitive and challenging environment. It therefore places great emphasis on motivating staff through engagement, recognition and an alignment of rewards to corporate and individual performance, as well as long-term interests of the Group and shareholders.

The Board has a formal and transparent process for developing policies on Director and executive remuneration, and for fixing the remuneration packages of individual Directors and Key Management Personnel. No Director is involved in deciding his or her own remuneration.

# 6.1 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE NOMINATING AND REMUNERATION COMMITTEE

# THE RC ROLE

In relation to the RC Role, the NRC plays an important role in setting the Group's remuneration framework and strategy for compensation of both Directors and Key Management Personnel. As per the terms of reference, the NRC makes recommendations to the Board on the specific remuneration package for each Director, appropriate to the level of contributions. In respect of the Key Management Personnel, it reviews their remuneration with the purpose of developing talent and building leadership bench strength to ensure the Group's continued success and the enhancement of shareholder value.

# 6.2 COMPOSITION OF THE NOMINATING AND REMUNERATION COMMITTEE

The 2018 Code stipulates that the RC comprises at least three (3) Directors, all of whom are non-executive and the majority of whom, including the Chairman of the RC, are independent. As at 31 December 2023, the NRC comprised six (6) independent NEDs.

# 6.3 REMUNERATION MATTERS

The NRC considers all aspects of remuneration including the terms of termination, to ensure that they are fair.

Members of the NRC are NEDs, all of whom, including the Chairperson of the NRC, are independent of the Management and free from any business or other relationships, which may materially interfere with the exercise of independent judgement.

All decisions by the NRC are made by a majority of votes of the NRC members who are present and voting. Any member of the NRC with a conflict of interest in relation

to the subject matter under consideration will abstain from voting, approving or making recommendations that would affect the decisions of the NRC. The MD/ GCEO is not present and does not participate in any NRC discussions pertaining to his own compensation and the review of his performance. He is, however, in attendance when the compensation of other Key Management Personnel is discussed. No Director is involved in deciding his or her own remuneration.

The key terms of reference of the NRC, in relation to remuneration matters, include the following:

(i) Establish a formal and transparent procedure for developing the Group's remuneration policies and fix the remuneration packages for individual Directors and Key Management Personnel, and review the remuneration framework and strategy for executive compensation, with the purpose of developing talent and building leadership bench strength to ensure the Group's continued success;  
(ii) Review and recommend to the Board the remuneration framework and the specific remuneration package for each Director, and ensure that the level of remuneration offered is appropriate to the level of contribution;  
(iii) Review and approve the remuneration framework and the specific remuneration packages of Key Management Personnel to ensure that they are aligned with the long-term interests of the Group and appropriate to attract, retain and motivate Key Management Personnel to provide good stewardship of the Group and to successfully manage the Group for the long term;  
(iv) Review the Group's obligations arising in the event of termination of Directors and Key Management Personnel to ensure they are fair, reasonable and equitable, including the cessation of financial incentives that have been earned but not yet disbursed due to exceptional circumstances of misstatement or misconduct; and  
(v) Review and approve the grant of performance share awards under the ComfortDelGro Executive Share Award Scheme to Group employees and Executive Directors.

# 6.4 ACCESS TO COMFORTDELGRO GROUP CHIEF HUMAN RESOURCE OFFICER AND APPOINTMENT OF EXTERNAL REMUNERATION CONSULTANTS

The NRC has unrestricted access to the Group Chief Human Resource Officer, who attends all NRC meetings and provides the relevant market remuneration data and practices to the Committee. The NRC may also seek external expert advice on such matters where needed. When such advice is sought, the NRC will

ensure that there is no existing relationship between the Group and its appointed consultants that will affect the independence and objectivity of the consultants.

In FY2023, the Company engaged the services of an external independent consulting firm, Korn Ferry, to assess the appropriateness of the NEDs' remuneration. Korn Ferry benchmarked the Directors' Fees against other companies with similar revenue and market capitalisation levels and took into account the Directors' level of contributions, time and effort spent on discharging their responsibilities. It was determined that the Directors' Fees were generally competitive with companies within the peer group except for the fees for the Board Chairman, the ARC Chairman and Members, and the SC Chairman and Members which were below market rate.

It is the view of the NRC that there has been no existing relationship between both Korn Ferry and Willis Towers Watson and the Group, and there was therefore sufficient independence and objectivity in their assessment of the compensation packages.

# PRINCIPLE 7: LEVEL AND MIX OF REMUNERATION

The Group is transparent about its remuneration policies, level and mix of remuneration, the procedures for setting remuneration, and the relationship between remuneration, performance and value creation.

The level and structure of remuneration of the Board and Key Management Personnel are appropriate and proportionate to the sustained performance and value creation of the Group, taking into account the strategic objectives of the Group, and are suitable to attract, retain and motivate the Directors and Key Management Personnel to successfully manage the Group for the long term.

# 7.1 PERFORMANCE-RELATED REMUNERATION

The Group is committed to creating and enhancing shareholder value through growth that is sustainable and profitable. The remuneration packages of the MD/ GCEO and Key Management Personnel comprise fixed and variable components, and are appropriate and proportionate to the sustained performance and value creation of the Group. The variable component in the form of year-end performance bonuses represents a significant proportion of the remuneration packages, and is dependent on the profitability of the Group and individual performance. Subject to market conditions and the operating environment, the Group's guidelines on fixed to variable component ratios in respect of compensation packages are 70:30 for Rank-and-File Employees, 60:40 for Middle Management staff and 50:50 for Senior Management staff. Notwithstanding the guidelines, the actual compensation packages for employees are ultimately determined on a case

by-case basis with the aim of maximising employee engagement and retention. The Group believes that a higher proportion of performance-related components would ensure greater alignment of interests of the employees with those of shareholders and contribute to sustainable performance and value creation in the long term. In addition, the remuneration of the MD/GCEO is also tied to the return on shareholder funds vis-à-vis the weighted average cost of capital and the level of profitability achieved.

# SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM INCENTIVE SCHEMES

# (a) ComfortDelGro Employee Share Option Scheme ("CDG ESOS") $^{(1)}$

The CDG ESOS which ran for a period of ten (10) years was approved by the shareholders of the Company on 18 February 2003. It expired on 17 February 2013 and hence no options have been granted since then. The options granted continued to vest according to the terms and conditions of the CDG ESOS until the end of February 2023. The CDG ESOS is administered by the NRC of the Company.

# (b) ComfortDelGro Executive Share Award Scheme ("CDG ESAS" or the "SCHEME") $^{(1)}$

The Company obtained shareholder approval at its AGM held on 26 April 2018 to implement the CDG ESAS for Executive Directors and key executives as part of the long-term incentive programme to attract talent, retain them and reward those who make significant contributions to the Group.

Share awards are granted conditional upon performance targets being met and have a vesting schedule whereby only a portion of the benefits will be vested each year. The grant of the shares may be withdrawn or clawed back in the event of exceptional circumstances of material misstatement of financial results or misconduct resulting in financial or other losses for the Group.

The aggregate number of shares which may be issued pursuant to the Scheme and any other share-based schemes (if applicable) shall not exceed in aggregate (for the entire duration of the Scheme) two per cent (2%) of the total number of issued shares (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings) from time to time.

In FY2023, the Company granted total share awards of 920,000 ordinary shares (FY2022: 755,000) pursuant to the Scheme to selected employees of the Group. This included an award of 150,000 ordinary shares to the MD/GCEO, Mr Cheng Siak Kian. These are time-based awards to be vested over a four-year period.

Total share awards granted to the Executive Director of the Company in FY2023 are as follows:

<table><tr><td>NAME OF PARTICIPANT</td><td>SHARE AWARDS GRANTED 
DURING FY2023 
(Shares Awarded TO 
BE VESTED OVER 4-YEAR 
PERIOD)</td><td>AGGREGATE 
SHARE AWARDS GRANTED

FY2023</td><td>AGGREGATE SHARE

(UNVested SHARES)</td></tr><tr><td>CHENG SIAK KIAN</td><td>150,000</td><td>315,000</td><td>78,750</td><td>236,250</td></tr></table>

No participants to the CDG ESAS are controlling shareholders of the Company or their associates.

The Board and the members of the NRC who administer the Scheme, believe that the Scheme will help ensure that the Group continues to have a strong leadership team, credible talent pipeline and reinforce the delivery of long-term shareholder value.

(1) Details of the CDG ESAS are found in the Directors' Statement on pages 100 to 102 of this Annual Report.

# 7.2 REMUNERATION OF NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS

The structure for the payment of fees to NEDs is based on a framework comprising basic fees, attendance fees and additional fees for serving on Board Committees and also, where applicable, for undertaking additional services for the Group.

# 3. ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT

The Board has overall accountability to the shareholders of the Company and ensures that the Group is managed well and guided by sustainable long-term strategic objectives. The Board is responsible for providing a balanced and understandable assessment of the Group's performance, position and prospects. Material price-sensitive and trade-sensitive information, Annual Reports and other material corporate developments are disseminated in a timely and transparent manner and posted on the Company's website as well as SGXNET. The financial results are reported semi-annually via SGXNET with an accompanying Negative Assurance by the Board to confirm that nothing has come to its attention that may render the results false or misleading in any material aspect. The Company believes that prompt and full compliance with statutory reporting requirements is fundamental to maintaining shareholder confidence and trust.

# DEALINGS IN SECURITIES

The Group has a formal policy ("Policy on Securities – Restrictions Against Dealings") to provide Directors and executives of the Group with guidance in relation to dealings in the Company's securities. Directors and executives of the Group are prohibited from dealing in the securities of the Company and its listed subsidiaries, SBS Transit and VICOM, during the period commencing one month before the announcement of the Company's and its listed subsidiaries' semi-annual results or full-year results (as the case may be) and ending on the date of the announcement of the relevant results. All Directors and executives are notified of the trading blackout periods before the start of the financial year and are given reminders prior to each trading blackout period.

All Directors and executives of the Group are also told that they must not deal in (i) the securities of the Company and its listed subsidiaries, SBS Transit and VICOM, on short-term considerations and/or while in possession of unpublished material price-sensitive and trade-sensitive information relating to the relevant securities; and (ii) the securities of other listed companies while in possession of unpublished material price-sensitive and trade-sensitive information relating to those securities. Executives are required to notify the Company upon disposal of shares arising from the exercise of options under the Employees' Share Option Scheme.

The Group has put in place a standard operating procedure ("SOP") on compilation of information on privy persons who have access to material information of transactions that have yet to be disclosed to the public. The SOP prescribes that the person-in-charge of such transactions must remind all privy persons to keep all material information strictly confidential.

# PRINCIPLE 9: RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL

The Board is responsible for the governance of risk and ensures that the Management maintains a sound system of risk management and internal control to safeguard the interests of the Company and its shareholders.

# 9.1 DETERMINATION OF THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF SIGNIFICANT RISKS

Risk management is an important and integral part of ComfortDelGro's strategic planning and decision-making process. The Board is responsible for the governance of risk, and with the assistance of the Audit and Risk Committee, oversees the company's risk management framework and policies. Key and emerging risks are identified by Senior Management on a regular basis, and reported to the Board quarterly, through the Audit and Risk Committee. Ownership of the risk management process is clearly defined and cascaded to the executive and functional levels, with stewardship retained at Senior Management. Action plans necessary to manage the risks are in place, and key risk indicators are monitored to ensure risks are managed within the Board's risk appetite. The adequacy and effectiveness of the risk governance, risk policy and internal controls are also assessed as part of the risk process, through the annual management control self-assessment. Based on these reviews, the Board is of the view, with the concurrence of the Audit and Risk Committee, that the risk management systems and internal controls (covering the principal risk categories of financial, operational, compliance and information technology) for the Group are adequate and effective. A detailed description of the Group's approach to internal controls and risk management can be found from pages 86 to 95 of this Annual Report.

As part of the risk management process, all businesses are required to refresh their risk inventories, conduct risk prioritisation exercises, identify key and emerging risks, and develop the requisite risk control and risk treatment action plans. The identified risks, their indicators and action plans are continually reviewed and reported.

The Internal and External Auditors conduct reviews in accordance with their respective audit plans. Any material non-compliance and recommendations for improvements on the internal controls are reported to the ARC. The ARC also reviews the effectiveness of the actions taken by the Management on the recommendations made by the Internal and External Auditors. The recommendations are followed up as part of the Group's continuous review of the system of internal control. However, there is no system of internal controls and risk management that can provide absolute assurance against human errors, frauds and other irregularities.

# 9.2 ASSURANCE FROM THE CEO, GROUP CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AND THE KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL

For FY2023, the Board has received assurance from the MD/GCEO and the Group Chief Financial Officer ("GCFO") that:

# 10.4 INTERNAL AUDIT

The Internal Audit function of the Group is performed by the Group Internal Audit Division comprising suitably qualified and experienced Internal Audit staff including the Group Chief Internal Audit Officer ("GCIAO"). The Group Internal Audit staff have professional qualifications and are either members of the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants, CPA Australia, the Information Systems Audit and Control Association or the Institute of Internal Auditors. The GCIAO reports functionally to the Chairman of the ARC and administratively to the MD/GCEO. The ARC participates in the hiring, removal and evaluation of the GCIAO. The GCIAO's remuneration is reviewed by the ARC Chairman together with the MD/GCEO in accordance with the Company's financial authority limits before they submit their recommendation to the Chairman and/or the NRC for consideration, as the case may be.

The Group Internal Audit Division adopts a risk-based approach in its continuous audit work with focus on material internal control systems including financial, operational, information technology and compliance controls. It provides an independent and objective evaluation of the internal control systems and corporate governance processes of the Group. The annual audit plan is developed by the GCIAO in consultation with, but independent of, Management and is subject to the ARC's approval before the start of each financial year. Quarterly internal audit reports are also prepared and submitted to the ARC. Any material non-compliance or lapses in internal controls are reported to the ARC and the MD/GCEO for improvements to be made. The ARC conducts reviews of the adequacy, effectiveness, independence, scope and results of the internal audit function. The ARC has full access to the GCIAO, and meets with the GCIAO at least once a year in the absence of the Management. The Group Internal Audit Division is given unfettered access to all the Group's documents, records, properties and personnel, including access to the ARC, and has appropriate standing within the Group.

The activities and organisational structure of the Group Internal Audit Division are monitored and reviewed by the ARC periodically to ensure that it has the necessary resources to adequately perform its functions and that there are no unjustified restrictions and limitations placed on the performance of its duties. The Group Internal Audit Division has adopted the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing laid down in the International Professional Practices Framework issued by the Institute of Internal Auditors ("IIA Standards"). During the year, the Group engaged Protiviti Pte Ltd to conduct a Quality Assurance Review of the Group's Internal Audit function. The Group Internal Audit Division continues to meet or exceed the IIA Standards in all key aspects. The Quality Assurance Review is conducted every 5 years.

The ARC finds the Group Internal Audit Division independent, effective and adequately resourced.

# 10.5 AUDIT AND RISK COMMITTEE'S ACTIVITIES

The ARC held four (4) meetings during the financial year under review. The MD/GCEO, the GCFO and GCIAO were present at these meetings. The External Auditors attended the meetings that discussed the half-year and full-year results. The ARC reviewed and considered the following:

The ARC meets with the Internal and External Auditors annually in the absence of the Management. During these meetings, the Internal and External Auditors may raise issues encountered in the course of their work directly to the ARC.

<table><tr><td>SIGNIFICANT MATTERS</td><td>REVIEW OF SIGNIFICANT MATTERS BY THE ARC</td></tr><tr><td>Impairment assessment of vehicles, premises and equipment, intangible assets, goodwill and investment in subsidiaries</td><td>The ARC considered the approach and methodology applied to the valuation model for taxi vehicles, taxi licences and goodwill impairment assessment.Following the review and discussions with Management and the External Auditors, the ARC is satisfied that the key assumptions used in the impairment assessment of taxi vehicles, taxi licences and goodwill are reasonable.</td></tr><tr><td>Recognition and measurement of provision for accident claims</td><td>The ARC considered the approach and methodology applied to the valuation and completeness of provision for settlement of accident claims.Following the review and discussions with Management and the External Auditors, the ARC is satisfied with the estimates used in determining the probability and amounts of expected settlement claims.</td></tr><tr><td>Accounting for bus contracts with public transport regulators</td><td>The ARC considered the accounting treatment for the existing bus contracts where Management is required to determine whether the public-to-private arrangements are within the scope of SFRS(I) Interpretation (“INT”) 12 Service Concession Arrangements and how the bus assets owned or leased by the Group are recognised in the financial statements.Following the review and discussions with Management and the External Auditors on the judgement and interpretation applied in the application of SFRS(I) INT 12 and the treatment of bus assets owned or leased by the Group, the ARC is satisfied with the accounting treatment for the bus contracts.</td></tr><tr><td>Provision for rail contract</td><td>ARC considered the approach and methodology applied in the projection of the future financial performance under the new terms of the Consolidated Rail Licence as disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. Pursuant to the framework agreement under the New Rail Financing Framework Version 2 (“NRFF (Version 2)”) between a subsidiary of the Group, SBS Transit Ltd (“SBS Transit”) and the Land Transport Authority of Singapore (“LTA”), SBS Transit’s wholly-owned subsidiary, SBS Transit Rail Pte. Ltd. (“SBST Rail”) has been issued a Consolidated Rail Licence to operate the Downtown Line (“DTL”), North East Line (“NEL”), and Sengkang Punggol Light Rail Transit System (“SPLRT”) for a period of 11 years commencing 1 January 2022, and ending on 31 December 2032 (the “Consolidated Rail Licence” or “Rail contract”).Following the review and discussions with Management and the External Auditors, the ARC is satisfied with the assumptions and estimates used in the projection of the future financial performance.</td></tr></table>

Following the review and discussions on the above, the ARC recommended to the Board to approve the financial statements of the Group for FY2023.

# 10.7 REVIEW OF INDEPENDENCE OF EXTERNAL AUDITORS

Prior to the re-appointment of the External Auditors, the ARC assesses their independence based on the guidelines set by the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority and the Accountants Act 2004 of Singapore. Having satisfied itself that the independence of the External Auditors, EY, is not impaired by their provision of non-audit services to the Group and that Rules 712, 715 and 716 of the SGX-ST Listing Manual have been complied with, the ARC has recommended to the Board to nominate EY for re-appointment as the Company's External Auditors at the next AGM.

As a further safeguard of EY's independence, the Company will require the firm to change their partner-in-charge once every five (5) years if it continues to engage them in subsequent years.

# 10.8 WHISTLE BLOWING POLICY

The Group's Whistle Blowing Policy, which is published on the corporate website, provides a mechanism for employees and external parties to raise concerns about possible improprieties in financial reporting or other improper business conduct, whilst protecting the whistleblowers from reprisal within the limits of the law. Under the Whistle Blowing Policy, incidents may be reported to the GCIAO and, where the incident involves the GCIAO, the complaint may be made to the ARC Chairman.

The contact information is as follows:

i. Group Chief Internal Audit Officer at DID: +65 6383 7010 or by email togciao@comfortdelgro.com or via the intranet.  
ii. Chairman of the ARC via this email: ARC_Chairman@comfortdelgro.com

All cases are investigated and overseen by the Group Internal Audit Division, and dealt with promptly and thoroughly. The identity of whistleblowers is kept confidential, and the Group is committed to ensuring the protection of whistleblowers against detrimental or unfair treatment. The ARC is responsible for oversight and monitoring of whistleblowing.

# 4. SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS AND ENGAGEMENT

# PRINCIPLE 11: SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS AND CONDUCT OF GENERAL MEETINGS

# 11.1 DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO SHAREHOLDERS

The Company notifies shareholders in advance of the dates of release of its financial results through the Company's website as well as SGXNET. Communications with shareholders are conducted through announcements to the SGXNET, media and analyst briefings after the announcement of the financial results together with its presentation materials, as well

as the posting of announcements and press releases on the Company's website. The Group has formulated a Policy on Securities – Drafting and Releasing SGX-ST Announcements to provide guidance on preparation of SGX-ST announcements.

Shareholders may send in their requests or queries through the feedback channel provided on the Company's website. The ComfortDelGro Group's IR team is accessible throughout the year to address shareholders' queries. The contact details of the ComfortDelGro Head of Group Investor Relations can be found on the Company's website.

Beyond complying with the requirements of the 2018 Code, the SGX-ST Listing Manual and the Companies Act, the Company has also taken various additional measures to enhance corporate governance and improve transparency, including:

(i) The Notice of AGM is released publicly at least twenty-eight (28) days before the AGM is held; and  
(ii) The Annual Report is available to all shareholders at the Company's website at least twenty-eight (28) days before the AGM to ensure that all shareholders have adequate time to review the Annual Report before the AGM. The electronic documentation demonstrates the Group's commitment towards green and sustainability solutions. Upon request, hard copies are provided to shareholders.

# 11.2 RESOLUTIONS AND VOTING AT GENERAL MEETINGS

Each issue or matter requiring shareholder approval is tabled as a separate and distinct resolution. All resolutions at the shareholder meetings are single-item resolutions. The Company does not practise bundling of resolutions. The Company will consider implementing absentia voting methods such as voting via mail, e-mail or fax when security, integrity and other pertinent issues are satisfactorily resolved.

The Constitution of the Company provides for voting in person and by proxy at the AGM of the Company. Each shareholder is allowed to appoint up to two (2) proxies to vote on his/her behalf at shareholder meetings through proxy forms sent in advance. Relevant intermediaries such as the Central Provident Fund and custodian banks are entitled to appoint more than two proxies to attend, speak and vote at shareholder meetings. Shareholders who hold shares through these relevant intermediaries will be allowed to attend, speak and vote at the AGM subject to being appointed a proxy by their respective relevant intermediaries.

The Company has adopted electronic poll voting for general meetings since 2011 to ensure greater transparency and efficiency in the voting process

and results. Shareholders are invited to vote on each of the resolutions by poll, using an electronic voting system. The results of all votes cast for or against each resolution or abstentions, if any, and the respective percentages (voting results) and the names of the independent scrutiners for the AGM are presented during the AGM and are announced via the SGXNET after the AGM. Voting by poll is the most accurate means of tabulating shareholders' votes according to the number of shares owned. The Company believes that this will encourage greater shareholder participation at the Company's general meetings and demonstrates the Company's commitment to high standards of corporate governance and transparency.

# 11.3 CONDUCT OF SHAREHOLDER MEETINGS INCLUDING DIRECTORS' ATTENDANCE

The Company encourages and supports shareholder participation at general meetings, and views the AGM as a good opportunity for shareholders to meet the Board and Senior Management. The top criterion for selecting the AGM venue is a convenient location within Singapore accessible by public transport. Shareholders are informed of shareholders' meetings through notices published in the newspapers and circulars sent to all shareholders. All registered shareholders are invited to attend and participate actively in the AGM and are given the opportunity to seek clarification and/or to question the Group's strategic direction, business, operations, performance and proposed resolutions.

All Directors including the Chairman, MD/GCEO and the Chairpersons of the various Board Committees together with Senior Management and the Company Secretary are present to address any question or feedback raised by the shareholders at the AGM and thereafter, including those pertaining to the proposed resolutions before they are voted on. The External Auditors are also present to address shareholders' queries about the conduct of audit and the preparation and contents of the Auditor's Report.

# 11.4 VOTING AT GENERAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS

Similar to the Company's AGM for the Financial Year ended 31 December 2022 held on 28 April 2023, the Company's AGM for FY2023 to be held on 26 April 2024 will also be held both physically ("Physical Meeting") and by way of electronic means ("Virtual Meeting"). This is to facilitate high levels of shareholder engagement, with real-time communication and real-time live voting to be conducted during the AGM for shareholders and proxies attending the Physical Meeting and Virtual Meeting. Shareholders who are not able to attend the AGM in person or those who prefer to attend the live webcast may do so by audio or audio-visual means. The Company will adhere to the SGX-ST's guiding principle to provide answers to shareholders' questions within reasonable timelines. Please refer to the Notice of the FY2023 AGM of the Company for more information.

# 11.5 MINUTES OF GENERAL MEETINGS

The Company prepares minutes of general meetings that include substantial and relevant comments or queries from shareholders relating to the agenda of the meeting and responses from the Board and Management. The minutes are available to shareholders on the Company's website and SGXNET within one (1) month after the date of the AGM.

# 11.6 DIVIDEND POLICY

With effect from 14 August 2023, the Company's dividend policy has been revised from paying out at least  $50\%$  of the profit attributable to shareholders of the Company, to  $70\%$  of the profit attributable to shareholders of the Company. The dividend policy takes into account the long-term objective of maximising shareholder value, availability of cash and retained earnings, projected capital expenditure and growth opportunities. The Company declares dividends semiannually and informs its shareholders of the dividend payments via announcements to SGXNET. Special dividends may also be declared when the Company has achieved extraordinary gains or is celebrating a significant milestone. Dividends are paid to shareholders in an equitable and timely manner.

# PRINCIPLE 12: ENGAGEMENT WITH SHAREHOLDERS

# 12.1 REGULAR, EFFECTIVE AND FAIR COMMUNICATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS

The Company is committed to ensuring that accurate and pertinent information is disseminated to the market in a timely and transparent manner as part of good corporate governance. Shareholders can access the corporate website at www.comfortdelgro.com. The Group's Investor Relations Policy ("IR Policy") is available on the corporate website.

Communications with the SGX-ST are handled by the Company Secretary, while communications with shareholders, analysts and fund managers are handled by the Head of Group Investor Relations. Media relations is managed by the Group Chief Branding and Communications Officer. Specific guidelines have been laid down for compliance in respect of all public communications. The Company does not practise selective disclosure in the communication of material information.

In addition, the Company has put in place operational procedures to respond promptly to queries from the SGX-ST on any unusual trading activity in its securities and to clear all announcements to the SGXNET with the Board.

# 12.2 INVESTOR RELATIONS POLICY

The IR Policy sets out the process and mechanism to promote regular, effective and fair communications with shareholders and the investment community. The dedicated ComfortDelGro IR team works with Senior Management to proactively carry out this engagement programme which is described in more detail on page 53 of this Annual Report.

(v) Annual reports and sustainability reports;

# 5. MANAGING STAKEHOLDER RELATIONSHIPS

# PRINCIPLE 13: ENGAGEMENT WITH STAKEHOLDERS

The Company adopts an inclusive approach by balancing the needs and interests of material stakeholders as part of its overall responsibility to ensure that the best interests of the Group are served.

# 13.1 IDENTIFICATION OF AND ENGAGEMENT WITH MATERIAL STAKEHOLDERS

The Company has arrangements in place to enable it to engage stakeholders so as to better understand and take action to address their needs and interests. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has been taking every opportunity to make use of digital means to communicate with shareholders. We were one of the first companies in Singapore to hold hybrid meetings for its shareholders, with real-time communication and real-time live voting.

# 13.2 MANAGEMENT OF STAKEHOLDER RELATIONSHIPS

The basis for and methods of engagement with stakeholders, along with the key areas of focus for each stakeholder group, can be found in our Sustainability Report. Our Sustainability Report highlights the economic, environmental and social aspects of our developments and operations in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative Guidelines (G4 Core) and complies with the relevant requirements under the SGX-ST Listing Manual including Rules 711A and 711B. As part of the Company's sustainability efforts and to ensure more efficient engagement, the Company encourages all shareholders to give their express consent to receive communications to shareholders, including statutory notices for general meetings and other circulars, via email and digital platforms.

# 13.3 CORPORATE WEBSITE

The Company's website is regularly updated to communicate and engage with stakeholders.

# 6. ADDITIONAL MEASURES TO ENHANCE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The Company has also undertaken various additional measures to enhance corporate governance as follows:

# CORPORATE GIFTS/ENTERTAINMENT POLICY

Whilst business gifts and entertainment are courtesies that build goodwill and sound working relationships among business partners, the Group does not tolerate the improper use of gifts or entertainment to gain any special advantage in a business relationship.

The Group discourages the receipt of gifts or acceptance of entertainment, loans or other favours as these may compromise an employee's ability to make objective, independent and fair business decisions. Offering excessive gifts, in whatever form, or entertainment to others can also be open to misinterpretation.

Employees are therefore not permitted to offer or accept any gifts or entertainment without first seeking their supervisor's authorisation. Employees who receive gifts directly or indirectly in relation to their employment with the Group are expected to notify their supervisors and declare such gifts to the Group Human Resource Department. All gifts declared are processed through structured corporate procedures to ensure proper accountability.

Business gifts presented and entertainment on the Group's behalf are consistent with generally accepted corporate governance business practices and ethical standards and do not violate any applicable laws, regulations or policies of any country that the Group operates in or any company with which the Group has dealings.

# ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICY

The Group complies with all applicable laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates and conducts business in an open and transparent manner. It prohibits employees from directly or indirectly offering, promising to pay, or authorising the payment of money or anything of value for the purpose of gaining perceived advantage for the Group. All employees are responsible for following the Group's procedures, including audit controls, and for carrying out and reporting business transactions.

# BLOCK LEAVE POLICY

As a further risk mitigation measure and to enhance governance, the Group has a Block Leave Policy in place which applies to employees holding key functions. This arrangement allows covering officers to fully step into the duties of the employees on leave as an additional check and balance against any breaches.

# HEALTH AND SAFETY POLICY

Given the nature of the Group's businesses, the health and safety of the employees and customers are of paramount importance. Safety is, therefore, a perpetual top priority for the Group's operations. The Group complies with applicable statutory requirements and regulations in respect of health and safety, and has put in place procedures to guide proper safe work practices for the well-being of all employees and customers.

In 2022, following the issuance of the COP, the Group reviewed its work procedures and processes to ensure that its safety policies, standards and practices comply with the Workplace Safety and Health Act 2006 and the COP. The Group's current safety policies, standards and practices adhere to the core principles and measures set out in the COP.

Employees are sent for training to equip them with greater awareness and knowledge of good WSH practices. Employees are required to observe safety rules and carry out safe work practices that apply to their jobs to ensure a safe work environment for everyone. They are also strongly encouraged to surface safety issues to improve safety standards at the workplace.

# INFORMATION PROTECTION POLICY

The Group has also implemented an Information Protection Policy to ensure that all documents and data information of the Group are properly safeguarded.

Information is classified into strictly confidential, confidential-sensitive, confidential, restricted and unrestricted use based on its nature, content and implications. Processes and systems used to store, process or communicate information provide protection from unauthorised disclosure and use.

# DATA PROTECTION POLICY

All Business Units are required to comply with applicable laws pertaining to data protection. In particular, the business units in Singapore have implemented data protection policies and practices to ensure compliance with the obligations under the Personal Data Protection Act 2012, including the Do Not Call provisions that came into force in 2014.

# CYBERSECURITY POLICY

The Group has adopted the international Information Security Standard ISO 27000 in assessing and formulating the Group's cybersecurity framework. The Group regularly reviews its cybersecurity measures to ensure effective protection of its information technology systems and databases. The Group has implemented multi-layered defences, including firewalls, intrusion prevention system, network access control, server hardening, data encryption and employee security training. The Group keeps abreast of the evolving threats and the latest techniques, and actively collaborates with cybersecurity authorities and regulators to develop appropriate countermeasures.

The Group will continue to strengthen its capabilities in light of the way cybersecurity risks will evolve with the digital age. As and when necessary, the Group will take appropriate risk management decisions and implement security controls to secure its information infrastructure systems and databases. The Group has established protocols to deal with cybersecurity incidents in the event that a threat is detected.

# SUPPLIER ETHICS POLICY

The Group procures a wide range of goods and services from various businesses, companies, persons and entities and requires its suppliers to be in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and practises fair competition in accordance with local anti-trust and competition regulations. Suppliers must conduct their businesses with integrity, transparency and honesty and the Group does not condone any corrupt or fraudulent practices.

Suppliers must have in place health and safety policies for their employees and be committed to good environmental, social and governance practices. Suppliers must not trade in the securities of the Group while in possession of confidential non-public information.

# CREDITORS' PAYMENT POLICY

The Group values its suppliers and is committed to safeguarding creditors' rights and acknowledges the importance of paying invoices, especially those of small businesses, in a timely manner. It is the Group's practice to agree terms with suppliers when entering into contracts. The Group negotiates with suppliers on an individual basis and meets its obligations accordingly.

# STATEMENT OF RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL

The ComfortDelGro Group's Risk Management Framework provides a systematic process for the Group and its Business Units to identify and review the nature and complexity of the risks involved in their business operations and to prioritise resources to manage them. The Group is committed to enhancing shareholder value through sustainable and profitable growth, while taking measured and well-considered risks.

The Group's approach to risk management is underpinned by several key principles:

- Adopting an agile approach with a risk management process which is continuous and iterative, as the Group's businesses and operating environments are dynamic. The risk identification, assessment, monitoring and reporting practices are reviewed and updated regularly to ensure risks are managed proactively.  
- Establishing a clear and defined structure of ownership of and accountability for the risk management process within Business Units (BUs), departments and individuals. This ensures managers at each level can leverage their in-depth knowledge of their respective businesses to actively own and manage risk, with Senior Management retaining overall stewardship.  
- Embedding the risk management processes into day-to-day business operations and setting a strong tone from the top. Key risks are monitored through reporting of key risk indicators and escalated to Senior Management where necessary.

- Promoting risk awareness through risk workshops, continuous education and training, as well as communication through risk management forums and newsletters to sustain a risk-informed and risk-aware culture in the Group.

In 2023, COVID-19 measures continued to ease globally in the countries where we operate. In May, the United Nations World Health Organisation declared an end to COVID-19 as a public health emergency. 2023 was also a year marked by numerous global events ranging from geopolitical tensions to unprecedented natural disasters. These continue to introduce significant challenges to our business. We navigated through these uncertainties guided by our risk management framework and risk mitigation strategies to maintain operational stability and business resilience.

# RISK OVERSIGHT & GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE

ComfortDelGro's Board assumes the overall risk governance responsibility and sets the tone for the Group. The Audit and Risk Committee ("ARC") assists the Board in maintaining risk management and internal controls oversight. Internal Audit provides independent assurance on the adequacy and effectiveness of the Risk Management Framework and Internal Controls. The Management Risk Committee ("MRC") establishes and enforces the risk management and internal control system and ensures robust systems and processes are in place to identify and manage risks enterprise-wide. The Managing Director/Group Chief Executive Officer ("MD/GCEO") chairs the MRC, and members comprise the CEOs from major BUs and the Group Chief Division Officers (Corporate Office). The Group's key risks are identified, reviewed regularly, and presented to the ARC and the Board on a quarterly basis, or as necessary to the ARC.

The Board acknowledges that no system of internal controls and risk management can provide absolute assurance against poor judgement in decision-making, human errors, losses, fraud and other unexpected events.

The Group Risk Office facilitates discussions and sharing of risk information with the BU Risk Leads, through the Group Risk Management meetings. This collaboration ensures the effective and consistent implementation of risk management practices throughout the Group. Senior Management constantly reinforces this culture through active communication on our risk strategies and commitment, thereby establishing a strong 'tone from the top'.

Since refreshing our risk management framework in 2020, we continue to refine our risk management processes throughout the Group. To foster a risk-awareness culture within the Group, we integrated risk training into our new joiner orientation programme and regularly conduct risk training sessions for our existing employees. This educates our new joiners on our risk management framework and the various channels where risk matters are discussed and inquired. We also communicate through risk newsletters to embed these practices in our decision-making and business processes.

# RISK MANAGEMENT

Our risk management framework is aligned with the ISO 31000:2018 Risk Management and COSO Enterprise Risk Management Framework. BU-level tier 1 risks are identified through an annual risk workshop facilitated by the BU Risk Lead. These risks are consolidated by the Group Risk Office to ensure a comprehensive risk universe categorised across the strategic, financial, operational, compliance, and technology domains. These risks are presented to the Management Risk Committee and used to prioritise the Group's tier 1 risks for active management and monitoring by the Management team. The Group's tier 1 risks are presented to the ARC for endorsement, and risk movements and key risk indicators are reported to the ARC on a quarterly basis. The ARC provides oversight of the activities and management of these tier 1 risks to ensure the risks are managed within the Board's defined risk appetite and tolerance. This strengthens the top-down and bottom-up approach that engages everyone in the organisation and ensures alignment between strategic objectives and business-level performance.

# RISK APPETITE

The Board, with support from the ARC, endorses the Group's risk appetite statements and risk tolerance limits for the Group's key risks. These guide management in ensuring that appropriate levels of control are in place to manage the risks, while allowing business operations to continue to run.

Operating within the risk appetite framework reflects ComfortDelGro's dedication to providing value to shareholders through sustainable growth across strategic, operational, technological, and financial domains, while upholding legal and regulatory compliance. The Group is dedicated to conducting its affairs with integrity and adhering to its values, actively managing measured risks, and concurrently pursuing opportunities for business expansion.

# AUDIT PROCESS

The Internal and External Auditors conduct reviews in accordance with their audit plans to assess the adequacy of the internal controls that are in place. A risk-based approach has been adopted for the annual internal audit plan, which extends to the auditable universe of the Group. In the course of their audits, the Internal and External Auditors will highlight to the Management and the ARC the areas with material deficiencies, non-compliance, weaknesses or occurrences or potential occurrence of significant risk events. The auditors will also propose mitigating measures and treatment plans. The audit recommendations are to be followed up as part of the Group's continuous review of its system of internal controls, and the implementation status is reported to the ARC.

The Group Internal Audit is independent of the activities it audits, and has unfettered access to the ARC, the Board and the Management. In line with best practices, Group Internal Audit has a Quality Assurance Programme that covers all aspects of its audit activities and conforms to international standards of auditing.

The Code of Business Conduct includes the anti-corruption and anti-bribery policies that command zero tolerance on fraud, improper use of monetary favors, gifts or entertainment. In addition, employees should not put themselves in a position of conflict of interest with the Group. If there is a potential conflict of interest, employees should declare to their immediate supervisors and recuse themselves from the decision process. The Group also enhanced the mandatory Conflict of Interest declaration on our intranet site for a seamless process and reporting.

The CDG ESAS is administered by the Nominating and Remuneration Committee (the "Committee") comprising Mr Mark Christopher Greaves (Chairman), Mr Choi Shing Kwok, Mr Russell Stephen Balding AO, Ms Susan Kong Yim Pui, Mr Lee Jee Cheng Philip, and Mr Tan Peng Hoe, Steve.  
(ii) Under the CDG ESAS, the shares are granted conditional upon performance targets being met and have a vesting schedule whereby only a portion of the benefits would be granted each year. The grant of the shares may be withdrawn or clawed-back in the event of exceptional circumstances of material misstatement of financial results or misconduct resulting in financial or other losses for the Group.  
(iii) The Board and the Committee believe that the Executive Share Award Scheme will help ensure that the Group continues to have a strong leadership team, credible talent pipeline and reinforce the delivery of long-term shareholder value.  
(iv) During the financial year, the Company granted the fifth tranche of share awards of 920,000 (2022: 755,000) ordinary shares pursuant to the CDG ESAS to selected employees of the Group. This included an award of 150,000 (2022: 127,500) ordinary shares to Executive Director, Mr Cheng Siak Kian. These are time-based awards to be vested over a 4-year period.  
(v) No participants to the CDG ESAS are controlling shareholders of the Company and their associates.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

# TO THE MEMBERS OF COMFORTDELGRO CORPORATION LIMITED

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of ComfortDelGro Corporation Limited (the "Company") and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Group"), which comprise the Statements of financial position of the Group and the Company as at 31 December 2023, the statements of changes in equity of the Group and the Company and the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income and consolidated cash flow statement of the Group for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including material accounting policy information.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Group, and the Statements of financial position and the statement of changes in equity of the Company are properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1967 (the "Act") and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) ("SFRS(I)") so as to give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group and the financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2023 and of the consolidated financial performance, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group and changes in equity of the Company for the year ended on that date.

# Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing ("SSAs"). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority ("ACRA") Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities ("ACRA Code") together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Singapore, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ACRA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

# Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.

We have fulfilled our responsibilities described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying financial statements.

# Impairment assessment of vehicles, premises and equipment, intangible assets, goodwill and investment in subsidiaries

The Group and Company have a large number of vehicles, premises and equipment, intangible assets with either indefinite or definite useful lives, goodwill and investment in subsidiaries whose carrying amounts are material and are disclosed in Notes 12, 13, 14 and 8 to the financial statements, respectively. The carrying values of these non-financial assets are either tested individually or allocated to the respective cash generating units ("CGUs") for impairment assessment. Management is required to perform impairment assessments on CGUs with allocated goodwill and or intangible assets with indefinite useful lives (i.e., taxi licences) annually or when an indicator of impairment is identified. For other non-financial assets, the impairment assessment is performed when an indicator of impairment is identified at the reporting date. The impairment assessments require determination of the recoverable amount of the assets based on the higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal that are determined by applying valuation techniques such as the discounted cash flow method. The disclosures on the impairment assessments are made in Note 3 to the financial statements.

The estimates of the assets' recoverable amount involve the use of Management's assumptions, forecasts of future cash flows, future economic and market conditions relevant to the assets, and determination of appropriate discount rates. These and the identification of impairment indicators involve significant Management judgement and estimation uncertainty, including but not limited to economic outlook and the effects of changes in the environment. Consequently, we have considered this to be a key audit matter.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

# TO THE MEMBERS OF COMFORTDELGRO CORPORATION LIMITED

Key Audit Matters (cont'd)

Impairment assessment of vehicles, premises and equipment, intangible assets, goodwill and investment in subsidiaries (cont'd)

As part of our audit, we reviewed Management's identification of impairment indicators for the non-financial assets and their process and basis of determining recoverable amount of the relevant assets. We obtained the discounted cash flow computations based on financial and operating budgets prepared and approved by Management and evaluated the reasonableness of key assumptions and inputs used, including but not limited to profit margins, growth and discount rates by comparing to historical information, external market data and observed trends. We evaluated the robustness of management's budgeting process by comparing the actual results to previously forecasted results and performed sensitivity analyses on key assumptions for alternative reasonably possible scenarios. We also assessed the appropriateness of discount rates that are based on weighted average cost of capital with the assistance of our internal valuation specialist who relied on external data relevant to the geographical location of each asset. We also reviewed the adequacy of the disclosures in relation to the Group and Company's vehicles, premises and equipment, intangible assets, goodwill and investment in subsidiaries provided in aforementioned notes to the financial statements.

# Recognition and measurement of provision for accident claims

The Group recognises a provision for accident claims arising from its transportation business when it has a present obligation (legal or constructive) that would result in an expected settlement that can be reliably estimated. The carrying amount of the provision for accident claims are disclosed in Note 21 to the financial statements.

Management exercises significant judgements in determining the estimated amounts required to settle the obligations, which is inherently uncertain in both timing and amounts. Management considers the probability and amount of the expected settlement claims based on current available information such as claims history and payment trends. The key assumptions and estimates used by Management are disclosed in Note 3 to the financial statements. Given the significant Management judgement and estimation uncertainty involved, we have considered this to be a key audit matter.

As part of our audit, we reviewed Management's process of identifying accident claims that meet the recognition criteria and obtained Management's computation, assumptions and estimates used for the measurement of the provision. We evaluated the reasonableness of key assumptions and estimates used by Management to measure the provision, including reviewing the number of claims lodged, recent settlements, third party settlement data and accident claims statistics. We reviewed the adequacy and overall reasonableness of the provision by understanding reasons for any significant variances and corroborating them with publicly available information. We also reviewed the disclosures in relation to the Group's provision for accident claims provided in aforementioned notes to the financial statements.

# Accounting for bus contracts with public transport regulators

The Group's Public Transport Services segment has entered into contracts with public transport regulators (the "Grantors") in various markets where the Group operates bus assets and provide public bus services (the "Bus contracts"). As part of determining the appropriate accounting treatments for these Bus contracts, Management is required to determine whether these public-to-private arrangements are within the scope of SFRS(I) Interpretation ("INT") 12 Service Concession Arrangements and how the bus assets owned or leased by the Group are recognised in the financial statements. The applicability of SFRS(I) INT 12 is based on an assessment of whether the Grantors have both the control over the services to be provided using the bus assets and the residual interests at the end of the contract (the "Control test"). The Control test determines the Group's accounting treatment of the bus assets and the related revenue, income and expenses. The evaluation of the Management's assessment on accounting treatments for the Group's Bus contracts involved significant judgement. Accordingly, we have identified the accounting for Bus contracts with public transport regulators as a key audit matter.

As part of our audit, we reviewed and discussed with Management the key contractual terms, facts and circumstances of a representative sample of the Group's existing Bus contracts to evaluate the appropriateness of the accounting treatments applied, including but not limited to the applicability of SFRS(I) INT 12 and the treatment of bus assets owned or leased by the Group.

In addition to the aforementioned audit procedures, we obtained an understanding of Management's process of reviewing and identifying the key contractual terms, facts and circumstances of the Group's Bus contracts. We obtained and reviewed Management's assessment of the accounting treatments of the Group's Bus contracts based on the requirements of the relevant SFRS(I) standards and interpretations, the economic characteristics of the key contractual rights and obligations of the Grantors and the Group under the Bus contracts. We held discussions to understand and challenge Management's assumptions and judgements involved in evaluating each Bus contract and reviewed relevant supporting documents of the Bus contracts.

# Provision for rail contract

As disclosed in Note 37 to the financial statements, pursuant to the framework agreement under the New Rail Financing Framework Version 2 ("NRFF (Version 2)") between a subsidiary of the Group, SBS Transit Ltd ("SBS Transit") and the Land Transport Authority of Singapore ("LTA"), SBS Transit's wholly-owned subsidiary, SBS Transit Rail Pte. Ltd. ("SBST Rail") has been issued a Consolidated Rail Licence to operate the Downtown Line ("DTL"), North East Line ("NEL"), and Sengkang Punggol Light Rail Transit System ("SPLRT") for a period of 11 years commencing 1 January 2022, and ending on 31 December 2032 (the "Consolidated Rail Licence" or "Rail contract").

Management is required to assess whether provisions in respect to the Group's obligations under the Consolidated Rail Licence are required. As disclosed in Note 3 to the financial statements, these involve projections of the future financial performance of the Consolidated Rail Licence that are based on key assumptions and estimates including but not limited to ridership, fare adjustments, availability of grants from the LTA and projected operating costs changes, after taking into consideration the current ridership patterns, fare adjustments and key operating cost drivers. These assumptions and estimates involved significant Management judgement and estimation uncertainty. Accordingly, we have considered this to be a key audit matter.

We focused our review on evaluating the areas of significant judgement made by Management in their projection of the future financial performance of the DTL, NEL and SPLRT under the new terms of the Consolidated Rail Licence.

The audit procedures included obtaining and reading the framework agreement and certain key correspondences between the LTA and the Group. Discussions were held with Management on the areas of significant judgement in their projection of the future financial performance of the DTL, NEL and SPLRT. A review of the projected future financial performance of the DTL, NEL and SPLRT up to the end of the licence period was performed that included challenging key assumptions made by Management and reviewing relevant corroborative documentation of ridership projection, projected future fare adjustments and availability of grants from the LTA. We have also reviewed the adequacy of the related disclosures made in Notes 3 and 37 to the financial statements.

# Other Information

Management is responsible for other information. Other information consists of the information included in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

We obtained the Directors' Statement prior to the date of our auditor's report, and we expect to obtain the remaining other information included in the annual report after the date of our auditor's report.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. If, based on the work we have performed on the other information obtained prior to the date of the auditor's report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of Management and Directors for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the provisions of the Act and SFRS(I), and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The directors' responsibilities include overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

# TO THE MEMBERS OF COMFORTDELGRO CORPORATION LIMITED

# Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.  
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.  
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.  
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.  
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.  
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

# 1. CORPORATE INFORMATION

The Company (Registration No. 200300002K) is incorporated in the Republic of Singapore with its registered office and principal place of business at 205 Braddell Road, Singapore 579701. The Company is listed on the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited.

The principal activities of the Company are those of investment holding and the provision of management and shared services. The principal activities of the subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are described in Note 39.

The Financial Statements are expressed in Singapore dollars and all values are expressed in million (\$'mil) except when otherwise indicated.

The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group for the financial year ended 31 December 2023 and the Statement of Financial Position and Statement of Changes in Equity of the Company as at 31 December 2023 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 29 February 2024.

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION

# Basis of accounting

The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost basis, except as disclosed in the accounting policies below and are drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Singapore Companies Act 1967 and SFRS(I)s.

Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability which market participants would take into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these Consolidated Financial Statements is determined on such a basis, except for share-based payment transactions that are within the scope of SFRS(I) 2, leasing transactions that are within the scope of SFRS(I) 16, and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as net realisable value in SFRS(I) 1-2 Inventories or value in use in SFRS(I) 1-36.

# Adoption of new and revised financial standards

On 1 January 2023, the Group and the Company adopted all the new and revised SFRS(I) pronouncements that are relevant to its operations. The adoption of these new/revised SFRS(I) pronouncements does not result in changes to the Group's and the Company's accounting policies and has no material effect on the amounts reported for the current or prior years, except as disclosed below.

Amendments to SFRS(I) 1-12 Income Taxes - Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction

The above amendments apply for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023, which narrowed the scope of the recognition exemption so that it no longer applies to transactions such as leases and decommissioning obligations that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences.

The Group applies the amendments to transactions that occur on or after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. It also, at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented, recognises deferred tax for all temporary differences related to leases and decommissioning obligations and recognises the cumulative effect of initially applying the amendments as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at that date.

- A mandatory temporary exception to the recognition and disclosure of deferred taxes arising from the jurisdictional implementation of the Pillar Two model rules; and  
Disclosure requirements for affected entities to help users of the financial statements better understand an entity's exposure to Pillar Two income taxes arising from that legislation, particularly before its effective date.

Following the announcement in the Singapore Budget 2023, the legislation is expected to be effective in Singapore for the Group's financial year beginning on or after 1 January 2025. However, Pillar Two legislation has been enacted or substantively enacted in certain jurisdictions that the Group operates for financial year beginning on or after 1 January 2024. The Group is in scope of the enacted or substantively enacted legislation and has engaged a third-party consultant to independently perform an assessment of the Group's potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes.

The assessment of the potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes is based on the most recent tax filings, country-by-country reporting and financial statements for the constituent entities in the Group. Based on the assessment, the Pillar Two effective tax rates in most of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates are above  $15\%$  except for Ireland where the transitional safe harbour relief does not apply. Notwithstanding, considering the scale of the business operations in Ireland and the Pillar Two effective tax rate is close to  $15\%$ , the Group does not expect a material exposure to Pillar Two income taxes.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (cont'd)

New/Revised standards and improvements to the standards not yet adopted (cont'd)

Management anticipates that the adoption of the above SFRS(I) pronouncements in future periods is not expected to have a material impact on the Financial Statements in the period of their initial adoption.

# Basis of consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements incorporate the Financial Statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company and its subsidiaries. Control is achieved when the Company:

Has power over the investee;  
Is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and  
- Has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.

The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above.

Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Company loses control of the subsidiary. Specifically, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Group Income Statement and Group Comprehensive Income Statement from the date the Company gains control until the date when the Company ceases to control the subsidiary.

Profit or Loss and each component of Other Comprehensive Income are attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-controlling interests. Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.

When necessary, adjustments are made to the Financial Statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies in line with those consistently used by the Group.

Changes in the Group's ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in the Group losing control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the Group's interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to owners of the Company.

All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.

Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group's equity therein. Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination (see below) and the non-controlling interests' share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. Losses are attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.

In the Statement of Financial Position of the Company, investments in subsidiaries and associates are carried at cost less any impairment in net recoverable value that has been recognised in Profit or Loss.

# Business combinations

The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of acquisition, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group to the former owners of the acquiree in exchange for control of the acquiree. The acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under SFRS(I) 3 Business Combinations are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date except for deferred tax assets or liabilities which are recognised and measured in accordance with SFRS(I) 1-12 Income Taxes. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in Profit or Loss as incurred.

The interest of the non-controlling shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the non-controlling interest's proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (cont'd)

# Business combinations (cont'd)

If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period (see below), or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.

The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and is subject to a maximum of one year from acquisition date.

# Financial instruments

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group's Statement of Financial Position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through Profit or Loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in Profit or Loss.

# Financial assets

All financial assets are recognised and de-recognised on a trade date basis where the purchase or sale of financial assets is under a contract whose terms require delivery of assets within the time frame established by the market concerned.

All recognised financial assets are subsequently measured in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value, depending on the classification of the financial assets.

# Classification of financial assets

Debt instruments that meet the following conditions are subsequently measured at amortised cost less impairment loss:

- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and  
- the contractual terms of the instrument give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

Investments in debt instruments that meet both the following conditions are subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income ("FVTOCI"):

- the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and  
- the contractual terms of the instrument give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

All other financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value through Profit or Loss ("FVTPL").

# Amortised cost and effective interest method

The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a debt instrument and of allocating interest income over the relevant period.

The amortised cost of a financial asset is the amount at which the financial asset is measured at initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount, adjusted for any loss allowance.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (cont'd)

Financial assets (cont'd)

Debt instruments classified as at FVTOCI

Investments in debt instruments at FVTOCI are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs. Subsequently, any gains or losses on such a financial asset are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income ("OCI"), except for impairment gains or losses and foreign exchange gains and losses until the financial asset is derecognised. When the financial asset is derecognised the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to Profit or Loss for the period.

Interest income is recognised in Profit or Loss and is included in the "Net Income from Investments" line item in Profit or Loss.

Equity instruments designated at FVTOCI

On initial recognition, the Group can make an irrevocable election (on an instrument-by-instrument basis) to designate investments in equity instruments as FVTOCI. Designation at FVTOCI is not permitted if the equity instrument is held for trading.

Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Subsequently, they are measured at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value including any foreign exchange difference are recognised in OCI. Such equity investments are not subject to impairment requirements. The amounts recognised in OCI are not subsequently reclassified to Profit or Loss on disposal of the equity instruments.

Dividends on these investments in equity instruments are recognised in Profit or Loss when the Group's right to receive the dividends is established, unless the dividends clearly represent a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Dividends are included in the "Net Income from Investments" line item in Profit or Loss.

Impairment of financial assets

The Group recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses ("ECL") on investments in debt instruments that are measured at amortised cost or at FVTOCI. No impairment loss is recognised for investments in equity instruments. The amount of ECL is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the respective financial instrument.

The Group applies the simplified approach permitted by SFRS(I) 9 for trade receivables. The ECL on these financial assets are estimated based on the Group's historical credit loss experience, adjusted for factors that are specific to the debtors as well as current and forecast general economic conditions at the reporting date.

To assess whether there is a significant increase in credit risk, the Group compares the risk of a default occurring on the asset as at the reporting date with the rate of default as at the date of initial recognition. It considers available reasonable and supportive forward-looking information, where relevant.

A default on a financial asset is when the counterparty fails to make contractual payments within a specific period after the credit period granted.

A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of that financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired include taking into consideration observable data about the significant financial difficulty of the issuer or the borrower; a breach of contract, such as a default or past due event; it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation.

Where receivables have been written off, the Group continues to recover the receivables due. Where recoveries are made, these are recognised in Profit or Loss.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (cont'd)

Financial assets (cont'd)

Derecognition of financial assets

The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another party.

On derecognition of a financial asset measured at amortised cost, the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable is recognised in Profit or Loss. In addition, on derecognition of an investment in a debt instrument classified as at FVTOCI, the cumulative gain or loss previously accumulated in the Investment Revaluation Reserve is reclassified to Profit or Loss. In contrast, on derecognition of an investment in equity instrument which the group has elected on initial recognition to measure at FVTOCI, the cumulative gain or loss previously accumulated in the Investment Revaluation Reserve is not reclassified to Profit or Loss, but is transferred to Retained Earnings.

# Financial liabilities and equity instruments

Classification as debt or equity

Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.

Equity instruments

An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

Borrowings

Interest-bearing loans are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised in Profit or Loss over the term of the borrowings.

Trade and other payables

Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.

Derecognition of financial liabilities

The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group's obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised and the consideration paid and payable, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in Profit or Loss.

# Hedging instruments and hedge accounting

The Group uses hedging instruments to manage its exposure to fuel price fluctuation, interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks. The use of hedging instruments is governed by the Group's policies which provide written principles on the use of financial instruments consistent with the Group's risk management strategy (see Note 35).

Hedging instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the contract date, and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting year. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in Profit or Loss immediately unless the hedging instrument is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in Profit or Loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. The Group designates its hedging instruments as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges.

Hedging instruments are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. The fair value of hedging instrument is classified as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the maturity of the hedge relationship exceeds 12 months and as a current asset or current liability if the maturity of the hedge relationship is within 12 months.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (cont'd)

# Hedging instruments and hedge accounting (cont'd)

At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item, along with its risk management objective and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, which is when the hedging relationships meet all of the following hedge effectiveness requirements:

there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument;  
- the effect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from that economic relationship; and  
- the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the group actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the entity actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item.

The Group designates any interest rate swap for hedging of interest rate risk arising from borrowings as cash flow hedges. Hedges of both foreign currency risk and fuel price risk for future purchases of goods are designated as cash flow hedges.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.

Note 35(c) contains details of the fair values of the hedging instruments.

# Fair value hedge

Changes in the fair value of hedging instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in Profit or Loss immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged item that are attributable to the hedged risk.

# Cash flow hedge

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of hedging instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in OCI. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in Profit or Loss. Amounts recognised in OCI are taken to Profit or Loss when the hedged item is realised.

# Leases

# The Group as lessor

The Group enters into lease agreements as a lessor with respect to its properties and motor vehicles.

Leases for which the Group is a lessor are classified as finance or operating leases. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for the head lease and the sublease as two separate contracts. The sublease is classified as a finance or operating lease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease.

Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recognised as receivables at the amount of the Group's net investment in the leases. Finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the Group's net investment outstanding in respect of the leases.

When a contract includes lease and non-lease components, the Group applies SFRS(I) 15 Revenue to allocate the consideration under the contract to each component.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (cont'd)

Leases (cont'd)

The Group as lessee

The Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease, at inception of the contract. The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease arrangements in which it is the lessee, except for short-term leases (defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low value assets. For these leases, the Group recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased assets are consumed.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted by using the rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lessee.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise:

fixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives;  
variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the commencement date;  
the amount expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;  
the exercise price of purchase options, if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the options; and  
- payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the exercise of an option to terminate the lease.

The lease liability is subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability (using the effective interest method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made.

The lease liability is presented as a separate line in the Statements of Financial Position.

The Group remeasures the lease liability (and makes a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset) whenever:

the lease term has changed or there is a significant event or change in circumstances resulting in a change in the assessment of exercise of a purchase option, in which case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate; or  
the lease payments change due to changes in an index or rate or a change in expected payment under a guaranteed residual value, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using the initial discount rate (unless the lease payments change is due to a change in a floating interest rate, in which case a revised discount rate is used); or  
a lease contract is modified and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate at the effective date of the modification.

The right-of-use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments made at or before the commencement day, less any lease incentives received and any initial direct costs. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

Whenever the Group incurs an obligation for costs to dismantle and remove a leased asset, restore the site on which it is located or restore the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease, a provision is recognised and measured under SFRS(I) 1-37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets. The costs are included in the related right-of-use asset, unless those costs are incurred to produce inventories.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (cont'd)

Leases (cont'd)

The Group as lessee (cont'd)

Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter period of lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. If a lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group expects to exercise a purchase option, the related right-of-use asset is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset. The depreciation starts at the commencement date of the lease.

The right-of-use assets are presented within vehicles, premises and equipment in the Statements of Financial Position.

The Group applies SFRS(I) 1-36 to determine whether a right-of-use asset is impaired and accounts for any identified impairment loss.

Variable rents that do not depend on an index or rate are not included in the measurement of the lease liability and the right-of-use asset. The related payments are recognised as an expense in the period in which the event or condition that triggers those payments occurs and are included in the line 'Other operating costs' in the Group Income Statement.

As a practical expedient, SFRS(I) 16 permits a lessee not to separate non-lease components, and instead account for any lease and associated non-lease components as a single arrangement. The Group has not used this practical expedient. For contracts that contain a lease component and one or more additional lease or non-lease components, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative stand-alone price of the lease component and the aggregate stand-alone price of the non-lease components.

# Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises cost of purchase and those costs that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is calculated using the weighted average and first-in first-out method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.

# Vehicles, premises and equipment

Vehicles, premises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.

Capital projects in progress comprising development and construction costs incurred during the period of construction are carried at cost, less any recognised provision for impairment. Depreciation on these assets, on the same basis as other vehicles, premises and equipment, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.

Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of the assets, other than freehold land and capital projects in progress, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Number of years</td></tr><tr><td>Buses</td><td>12 to 20</td></tr><tr><td>Leasehold land and buildings</td><td>Over the remaining lease period</td></tr><tr><td>Freehold buildings</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Taxis, motor vehicles for rental and ambulances</td><td>5 to 10</td></tr><tr><td>Computers and automated equipment</td><td>3 to 5</td></tr><tr><td>Workshop machinery, tools and equipment:</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>- General workshop machinery, tools and equipment</td><td>3 to 10</td></tr><tr><td>- Specialised inspection and testing equipment</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Motor vehicles:</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>- Motorcycles</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>- Other motor vehicles</td><td>5 to 10</td></tr><tr><td>Furniture, fittings and equipment</td><td>5 to 7</td></tr></table>

The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at each year end, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (cont'd)

Vehicles, premises and equipment (cont'd)

On disposal of an item of vehicles, premises and equipment, the difference between the sales proceeds and its carrying amount is recognised in Profit or Loss.

Fully depreciated vehicles, premises and equipment still in use are retained in the Financial Statements.

# Assets held for sale

Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification. When the Group is committed to a sale plan involving loss of control of a subsidiary, all of the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary are classified as held for sale when the criteria described above are met, regardless of whether the Group will retain a non-controlling interest in its former subsidiary after the sale. Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.

# Joint arrangements

A joint arrangement is a contractual arrangement whereby two or more parties have joint control. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. To the extent the joint arrangement provides the Group with rights to the net assets of the arrangement, the arrangement is a joint venture.

# Joint ventures

The Group recognises its interest in a joint venture as an investment and accounts for the investment using the equity method.

# Associates

An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.

The Group accounts for its investments in associates and joint ventures using the equity method from the date on which it becomes an associate or joint venture.

The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these Consolidated Financial Statements using the equity method of accounting, except when the investment, or a portion thereof, is classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for in accordance with SFRS(I) 5. Under the equity method, an investment in an associate is initially recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group's share of the Profit or Loss and OCI of the associate. When the Group's share of losses of an associate exceeds the Group's interest in that associate (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group's net investment in the associate), the Group discontinues recognising its share of further losses. Additional losses are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.

Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the associate recognised at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment and is assessed for impairment as part of the investment. Any excess of the Group's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost of acquisition, after reassessment, is recognised immediately in Profit or Loss.

Where a Group entity transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the relevant associate.

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (cont'd)

# Intangible assets

Intangible assets acquired separately

Taxi licences and rights under contract acquired separately are recorded at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Taxi licences and rights under contract with finite useful lives are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each annual reporting year, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis. Taxi licences with indefinite useful lives are not amortised. Each period, the useful lives of such assets are reviewed to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life assessment for the asset. Such assets are tested for impairment in accordance with the policy below.

Intangible assets acquired in a business combination

Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are identified and recognised separately from goodwill where they satisfy the definition of an intangible asset and their fair values can be measured reliably. The cost of such intangible assets is their fair value at the acquisition date.

Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets acquired separately.

Software development costs

Research costs are recognised as an expense when incurred. Costs directly attributable to the development of software are capitalised as intangible assets only when technical feasibility of the project is demonstrated, the Group has an intention and ability to complete and use the software and the costs can be measured reliably. Such costs include purchases of materials and services and payroll-related costs of employees directly involved in the project.

# Goodwill

Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group's interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the subsidiary recognised at the date of acquisition. If, after reassessment, the Group's interest in the net fair value of the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the acquisition, the excess is recognised immediately in Profit or Loss.

Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any provision for impairment.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group's cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the provision for impairment is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. A provision for impairment recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.

On divestment of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the Profit or Loss on divestment.

# Impairment of non-financial assets excluding goodwill

At the end of each reporting year, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the provision for impairment (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (cont'd)

Impairment of non-financial assets excluding goodwill (cont'd)

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. A provision for impairment is recognised immediately in Profit or Loss.

Where provision for impairment subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no provision for impairment been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of provision for impairment is recognised immediately in Profit or Loss.

# Service concession contracts

Certain assets of the Group are used in connection with concession contracts granted by public sector customers ("concession grantors"). The characteristics of these contracts vary by contract, nevertheless, they generally provide, directly or indirectly, for the concession grantor's involvement on one hand in determining the service and compensation, and on the other, the return of certain assets necessary to perform the service at the end of the contract.

SFRS(I) INT 12 Service Concession Arrangements, is applicable to concession arrangements comprising a public service obligation and meeting the following criteria: the concession grantor controls or regulates the services to be provided by the operator using the asset, the beneficiaries of the service and prices applied; and the concession grantor controls the residual economic value of the assets at the end of the arrangement. For the Group's contracts where SFRS(I) INT 12 applies, the related assets are not recognised as tangible assets, but as financial assets ("financial asset model") of the Group.

# Financial asset model

The financial asset model applies if the operator has an unconditional right to receive cash or another financial asset from the concession grantor, in compensation for the concession services and assets provided by the operator. This occurs if the concession grantor contractually guarantees payment of amounts specified or determined in the contract, or of any shortfall, i.e the difference between amounts received from users of the public service and amounts specified or determined in the contract.

Financial assets resulting from the application of SFRS(I) INT 12 are recorded in the Statement of Financial Position under Trade and other receivables as Service concession receivable. They are recognised at amortised cost where the effective interest rate that indicated in the relevant contract forms the basis of recognition as the Group's revenue. The portion that matures in less than one year is presented in "current trade and other receivables" and the portion that matures in more than one year is presented in "non-current trade and other receivables".

In accordance with SFRS(I) 9 Financial Instruments, these assets are impaired using a model based on expected credit losses.

Cash flows generated by the Group in providing concession services and assets under the concession contracts are applied as receipts for the Service concession receivable, and consideration for revenue earned by the Group when it satisfies performance obligations under the contract. These cash flows are included in the Group cash flow statement as part of cash flows from operating activities.

# Fuel price equalisation account

At the direction of the Singapore Public Transport Council ("PTC"), a fuel price equalisation account ("FPEA") has been set up to account for diesel price and electricity tariff adjustment charge for the purpose of mitigating the effects of any increase in fuel price and electricity tariff.

Annual contributions to the FPEA may be required as determined by the PTC, based on the reference electricity tariff and diesel price for the year.

Applications can be made to the PTC to seek approval for a draw down as may be catered for by the purpose of the FPEA mechanism, provided that the amount drawn does not exceed half of the available FPEA balance.

# Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

The amount recognised as a provision is the present value of the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting year, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.

Provision for accident claims

Claims for accident, public liability and others are provided in the Financial Statements based on the claims outstanding and the estimated amounts payable.

# Deferred income

Deferred income comprises of advance receipts from customers that are recognised to Profit or Loss when the services are rendered.

# Service benefits

These comprise the following:

(i) Retirement benefits

Under the Collective Agreement entered into by certain subsidiaries in Singapore with their relevant unions, a retirement benefit subject to a maximum of \(3,000 is payable to an employee retiring on or after attaining the retirement age and on completion of at least five years of service.

Provision is made in the Financial Statements based on the number of years of service rendered by qualifying employees and discounted to present value using the market yield of Singapore Government Bonds at end of the reporting period and after taking into account an estimated attrition rate. The estimated attrition rate used is based on the Management's best estimate using historical trend.

(ii) Long service awards

Staff of certain subsidiaries in Singapore serving more than 5 years and up to 35 years are entitled to long service awards. Provision is made in the Financial Statements based on the number of years of service rendered by qualifying employees.

The provision for retirement benefits and long service awards is discounted using the market yield of Singapore Government Bonds at the end of each reporting year.

Service benefits (cont'd)

(iii) Defined benefit retirement plans

The Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes ("Pension Schemes") for employees of one of its foreign subsidiaries, the assets of which are held in trustee administered funds.

The Pension Schemes were closed to future accruals in 2007 and employees were transferred to a defined contribution pension scheme.

The cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting year. Actuarial gains and losses arising over the financial year are recognised immediately in Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated in equity under retirement benefit reserve and are reflected in the Statement of Financial Position as a pension asset or liability as appropriate. The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Statement of Financial Position represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation net of fair value of plan assets.

Apart from the Pension Schemes above, the Group makes contribution to pension schemes as defined by the laws of the countries in which it has operations. In particular, Singapore Companies make contributions to the Central Provident Fund in Singapore, a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions to pension schemes are recognised as an expense in the period in which the related service is performed.

(iv) Employee leave entitlement

Employee entitlements to annual leave are recognised when they accrue to employees. A provision is made for the estimated liability for annual leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to the end of the reporting year.

(v) Share-based payments

The Company issued share options and share awards to certain employees and Directors within the Group. Share options and share awards are measured at fair value of the equity instruments (excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the share options and share awards are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with a corresponding adjustment against share option and share awards reserve, based on the Company's estimate of the number of equity instruments that will eventually vest.

Fair value for the share option is measured using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on Management's best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. The share options have been fully vested in prior years.

# Government grants

Government grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching to them and the grant will be received.

Government grants whose primary condition is that the Group should purchase, construct or otherwise acquire non-current assets are recognised as deferred grant in the Statement of Financial Position and transferred to Profit or Loss on a systematic and rational basis over the useful lives of the related assets.

Government grants in relation to expenses incurred are recognised in Profit or Loss in the period which they become receivable.

# Revenue recognition

The Group recognises revenue from the following major sources:

Public transport services  
Taxi  
Automotive engineering services  
Inspection and testing services  
Others

Revenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Group recognises revenue when it transfers control of a product to a customer or when services are rendered.

# Public transport services

Revenue from public transport services comes from the provision of bus and rail services to commuters travelling on public transport systems, contracted revenue for operations of scheduled services, provision of coach rental services and provision of non-emergency transport services to patients. Revenue from transport regulators for scheduled bus services is recognised as and when services are rendered, including an estimation of the expected consideration on achieving certain performance targets. Revenue from service concession arrangements are disclosed above under Service Concession Contracts. Revenue from commuters for rail services is recognised as and when services are rendered and revenue from transport regulator for rail services relates to performance incentives for achieving certain performance and service quality targets.

Revenue from other third parties for scheduled services, coach rental services, rail services and non-emergency transport services is recognised as and when services are rendered.

Revenue from other commercial services comprises advertising and rental income. Advertising production revenue is recognised when production is completed and advertising media revenue is recognised on a time proportionate basis over the term relevant contract. Rental income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.

# Taxi

The Group provides taxi rental and other related services such as subscription and cashless payment to third parties. Revenue is recognised as and when services are rendered.

# Automotive engineering services

The Group provides repair and maintenance services to taxi, buses and third parties. Revenue is recognised as and when services are rendered.

For sales of goods such as spare parts, diesel and petrol to third parties, revenue is recognised when control of the goods has been transferred to the customer, at the point where goods are delivered to the customer.

# Inspection and testing services

The Group provides vehicle inspection services and other testing services. Revenue from vehicle inspection services is recognised upon completion of the inspection services.

Revenue from testing services for aerospace, marine and offshore, biotechnology, oil and petrochemical, building construction and electronics manufacturing industries is recognised upon completion of the final test report.

# Others

Others include car rental and leasing, driver training and bus station operation.

Car rental and leasing and driver training revenue are recognised at point in time upon completion of the services.

Bus station operation revenue is recognised as and when services are rendered.

# Borrowing costs

Borrowing costs incurred to finance the purchase of assets are capitalised during the period of time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use. Other borrowing costs are recognised in Profit or Loss in the period in which they are incurred.

# Income tax

Current income tax liabilities (and assets) for current and prior periods are recognised at the amounts expected to be paid to (or recovered from) the tax authorities, using the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting year.

Deferred income tax assets/liabilities are recognised for deductible/taxable temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts. The principal temporary differences arise from depreciation, provision for fuel equalisation and future tax benefits from certain provisions not allowed for tax purposes until a later period. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised on taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting year and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

Current and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or income in Profit or Loss, except when they relate to items credited or debited outside Profit or Loss (either in OCI or directly in equity), in which case the tax is also recognised outside Profit or Loss (either in OCI or directly in equity), or where they arise from the initial accounting for a business combination. In the case of a business combination, the tax effect is taken into account in calculating goodwill or determining the excess of the acquirer's interest in the net fair value of the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over cost.

# Foreign currency transactions and translation

The individual Financial Statements of each Group entity are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (its functional currency). The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group and the Statement of Financial Position and Statement of Changes in Equity of the Company are presented in Singapore dollars, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In preparing the Financial Statements of the individual entities, transactions in currencies other than the entity's functional currency are recorded at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction. At the end of each reporting year, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at rates prevailing at the end of each reporting year. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing on the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.

Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on retranslation of monetary items are included in Profit or Loss for the period. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in Profit or Loss for the period except for differences arising on the translation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised in OCI. For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised in OCI.

In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts and options (please see above for details of the Group's accounting policies in respect of such hedging instruments).

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (cont'd)

# Foreign currency transactions and translation (cont'd)

For the purpose of presenting Consolidated Financial Statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group's foreign operations (including comparatives) are expressed in Singapore dollars using exchange rates prevailing at the end of the reporting year. Income and expense items (including comparatives) are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuated significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in OCI and accumulate in the Group's currency translation reserve. Such translation differences are recognised in Profit or Loss in the period in which the foreign operation is disposed of.

The Group has applied the option to reset the cumulative foreign currency translation differences for all foreign operations to zero at the date of transition to SFRS(I) on 1 January 2017. As a result, the cumulative foreign currency translation loss was reclassified from foreign currency translation reserve to accumulated profits as at 1 January 2017. After the date of transaction, any gain or loss on disposal of any foreign operation will exclude translation differences that arose before the date of transition.

On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities (including monetary items that, in substance, form part of the net investment in foreign entities), and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are recognised in OCI and accumulated in the currency translation reserve.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of a foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.

# Cash and cash equivalents in the group cash flow statement

Cash and cash equivalents in the Group Cash Flow Statement comprise cash on hand and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

# 3. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY

In the application of the Group's accounting policies, which are described in Note 2, Management is required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

# 3.1 Critical judgements in applying the Group's accounting policies

The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimates (see below), that Management has made in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies and that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Financial Statements:

# Provision for rail contract

In projecting the future financial performance of the Downtown Line ("DTL"), North East Line ("NEL") and Sengkang Punggol Light Rail Transport ("SPLRT") under the Consolidated Rail Licence as disclosed in Note 37, applying appropriate key assumptions relating to ridership growth, fare adjustments, availability of grants from the Authorities and operating costs projections. The Group also considers external information regarding forecasted economic indicators and geopolitical risk factors that could affect key operating costs drivers such as labour and energy costs. Based on SBS Transit Ltd ("SBST")'s Management's assessment, no provision for rail contract is required. Accordingly, the Group has not made provision on that basis.

# 3. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY (cont'd)

# 3.1 Critical judgements in applying the Group's accounting policies (cont'd)

Accounting for contracts with public transport regulator

The Group's Public Transport Services segment has entered into contracts with the public transport regulator (the "Grantor") whereby the Group operates bus and/or train assets and related infrastructure that are either owned by the Group or leased from the Grantor (the "Public Transport Assets") to provide public transportation services.

As part of determining the appropriate accounting treatments for these contracts, the Group applies judgement to determine whether these public-to-private arrangements are within the scope of SFRS(I) INT 12 Service Concession Arrangements that would affect the manner that the Public Transport Assets, the related expenditures incurred by the Group, the service and fare income earned by the Group, and payments made to the Grantor under these contracts are recognised in the Group's Statement of financial position and Income Statement. The applicability of SFRS(I) INT 12 is based on an assessment of whether the Grantor has both the control over the services to be provided using the Assets, and the residual interests at the end of the contract.

Key sources of estimation uncertainty

The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting year, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.

# 3.2 Provisions

Accident claims

Claims for property damage and personal injury are provided in the Financial Statements based on the claims outstanding as of the end of the financial year and estimated amounts payable. The past claims history and payment trends are used as a basis to estimate the amounts in which the Group will have to pay to third parties for such claims. The provision for accident claims included in Note 21 is $43.2 million (2022 $45.3 million).

# 3.3 Impairment review of taxi vehicles, taxi licences, goodwill and investment in subsidiaries

The Group tests goodwill and taxi licences with infinite useful lives for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are indications that they might be impaired. Impairment assessment is also performed for taxi vehicles with finite useful lives when there is an impairment indication. The Company assess any indicator for impairment for investments in subsidiaries annually, or more frequently if there are indications that they might be impaired.

Determining whether taxi vehicles, taxi licences with infinite useful lives, goodwill and investment in subsidiaries are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units ("CGUs") to which subsidiaries, taxi vehicles, taxi licences and goodwill have been allocated (Notes 8, 12, 13 and 14). The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. A provision for impairment loss on taxi vehicles, taxi licences, goodwill and investment in subsidiaries is recognised in Profit or Loss and can be reversed in the subsequent period except for goodwill when the amount of impairment loss decreases.

The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to profit margins during the period.

The Group and the Company prepare cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by Management for the next year and extrapolates cash flows based on estimated growth rate. The estimated terminal growth rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets and countries in which the CGU operates.

The discount rates applied to the forecast for the Group and the Company are based on current market assessment of the time value of money and risks specific to the business segment.

# 3.3 Impairment review of taxi vehicles, taxi licences, goodwill and investment in subsidiaries (cont'd)

For the public transport services businesses in Australia and the United Kingdom, discount rates of  $6.5\%$  (2022:  $5.8\%$ ) and  $7.8\%$  (2022:  $10.0\%$ ), and terminal growth rates of  $3.4\%$  (2022:  $2.5\%$ ) and  $0.6\%$  (2022:  $3.0\%$ ) are applied to the forecasts respectively.

For the taxi businesses in China and Singapore, discount rates of  $8.0\%$  (2022:  $8.2\%$ ) and  $8.5\%$  (2022:  $8.5\%$ ), and growth rates of  $2.5\%$  (2022:  $3.0\%$ ) and  $2.5\%$  (2022:  $NIL\%$ ) are applied to the forecasts respectively.

The expected changes to profit margins are based on past performance and Management's expectation of market development.

# 3.4 Allowance for inventory obsolescence

The Group's inventories comprised mainly parts, accessories and consumable stock required for the operation and maintenance of vehicles and equipment.

The terms of the rail licence contract and useful life of buses are considered in the determination of the useful life of the inventories. In addition to identification of obsolete inventories based on considerations such as phasing out of vehicle models and inventories purchased for specific projects which have ended, Management identifies inventories that are slow moving and evaluates the carrying value of inventories. An allowance for inventory obsolescence is recognised for these inventories based on its useful life and inventory turnover. Allowance for inventory obsolescence is disclosed in Note 7.

# 3.5 Useful lives of vehicles, premises and equipment

As described in Notes 2 and 12, the Group reviews the estimated useful lives of vehicles, premises and equipment at the end of each annual reporting year. During the financial year, Management determined that the estimated useful lives of vehicles, premises and equipment are appropriate and no material revision is required.

# 3.6 Goodwill arising from acquisition of businesses

Goodwill arising from acquisition of subsidiaries during the year was determined using a purchase price allocation exercise to determine the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities as disclosed in Note 14. Management exercised significant judgement in determining the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities including any intangibles.

The credit period on sale of goods and rendering of services ranges from 7 days to 60 days (2022: 7 days to 60 days) except for insurance claims against third parties which have no credit period due to their nature.

The Group adopts the policy of dealing only with customers of appropriate credit history. The expected risks of default on trade and other receivables at the reporting date are insignificant as majority of receivables are from the transport regulators, Government related agencies and insurance companies. Management has assessed the credit risk to be low. The receivables that are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided for are insignificant. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.

An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts which has been determined by reference to past default experience and ECL. The ECL incorporate forward looking estimates, where relevant. In calculating the ECL rates, the Group considers historical loss rates for each category of customers, and adjust for forward-looking macroeconomic data, where relevant.

* A leasehold building at a bus depot is stated at revalued amount being the fair value at the date of revaluation based on valuation performed by an independent external valuer. The revaluation was done by a subsidiary pursuant to the agreement in the Negotiated Contract under the Bus Contracting Model (Note 38) in Singapore. As at 31 December 2023, the carrying amount of the leasehold building would have been $7.4 million (2022: $8.5 million), had the depot been carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.  
On 13 June 2022, the Company signed an agreement with the Land Transport Authority on the sale and transfer of Soon Lee bus depot in 2024. The bus depot will be sold at the carrying value upon transfer in 2024, subsequent to a series of renovations and maintenance works to be completed before the handover date in 2024.

* A subsidiary of the Group has secured the right-of-use of leasehold land at a bus depot with no future payments required. The leasehold land is stated at revalued amount being the fair value at the date of revaluation based on valuation performed by an independent external valuer. The revaluation was done by a subsidiary pursuant to the agreement in the Negotiated Contract under the Bus Contracting Model (Note 38) in Singapore. As at 31 December 2023, the carrying amount of the leasehold land would have been $3.7 million (2022: $4.3 million), had the leasehold land been carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.

Of the carrying amount of \(205.7 million (2022: \)201.8 million) is $173.1 million (2022: $181.8 million) of taxi licences in China and \)6.8 million (2022: $6.6 million) of brands in the United Kingdom with indefinite lives. These taxi licences and brands are not amortised because there is no foreseeable limit to the cash flows generated. The carrying amount of intangible assets with indefinite life is allocated to the respective CGUs in China and United Kingdom.

The Group has conducted an analysis of the sensitivity of the impairment test to changes in the key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for each CGU to which taxi licences is allocated as discussed in Note 3.

The remaining balance of \(25.8 million (2022: \)13.4 million) mainly relates to \(3.1 million (2022: \)4.4 million) of rights under contract in Australia, \)6.1 million (2022: $1.3 million) of brands in the United Kingdom, \)12.1 million (2022: $2.9 million) of software development costs and $3.0 million (2022: 3.5 million) of customer relationship in Singapore with finite useful lives over which the assets are amortised.

# 31. EARNINGS PER SHARE

Earnings per share is calculated by dividing the Group's net profit attributable to shareholders of the Company for the year by the weighted average number of ordinary shares (excluding treasury shares) in issue during the financial year as follows:

<table><tr><td></td><td>2023 $’mil</td><td>2022 $’mil</td></tr><tr><td>Net profit attributable to shareholders of the Company ($’mil)</td><td>180.5</td><td>173.1</td></tr><tr><td>Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue (million)</td><td>2,165.9</td><td>2,166.7</td></tr><tr><td>Basic earnings per share (in cents)</td><td>8.33</td><td>7.99</td></tr></table>

For the purpose of calculating the diluted earnings per ordinary share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to take into account the dilutive effect arising from share awards, excluding 700,000 unvested shares (2022: 1,627,500) to employees because they are anti-dilutive.

# (b) Financial risk management policies and objectives

The main areas of financial risk faced by the Group are foreign exchange rate risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and fuel price risk. The Group recognises that management of financial risk is an important aspect in its drive towards creating shareholders' value. It is the Group's policy not to participate in speculative financial instruments. Management oversees financial risk management and regularly reviews its policy governing risk management practices.

There has been no change to the Group's exposure to these financial risks or the manner in which it manages and measures these risks.

# (i) Foreign exchange risk management

The Group manages its foreign exchange exposure by matching revenue and costs in the relevant currencies to create a natural hedge and also through active currency management using hedging instruments such as forwards and options where necessary. The Group's revenue is mainly denominated in Singapore Dollar ("SGD") with the remaining in Great British Pound ("GBP"), Renminbi ("RMB"), Australian Dollar ("AUD"), Euro ("EUR") and Malaysian Ringgit ("MYR"). On the cost side, its foreign currency exposures include United States Dollar ("USD"), GBP, RMB, AUD, EUR and MYR. The Group has investments in the United Kingdom, China, Australia, Ireland and Malaysia. Net translation risks are regularly monitored and the Group currently does not seek to hedge this exposure as it does not impact cash flows.

# Foreign currency sensitivity

The bulk of the Group's foreign currency exposures are in the functional currencies of its respective operations. Exposures to foreign currencies that are non-functional are actively managed as part of the overall foreign exchange risk management. Based on sensitivity analysis performed, Management has assessed that exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates arising from assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies of entities in the Group is minimal.

# (ii) Interest rate risk management

The Group's primary interest rate risk relates to its borrowings, investments in fixed income securities and deposits. The Group uses hedging instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps, where necessary, to achieve the desired interest rate profile in its effort to manage interest rate risk. The Group may borrow at variable rates and uses interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of future interest payments, which have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating rates to fixed rates.

# Interest rate sensitivity

The Group has interest-bearing assets such as fixed income securities and deposits as well as interest-bearing liabilities. Any change in interest rate affecting the interest-bearing assets shall have an offsetting impact from the interest-bearing liabilities. Based on sensitivity analysis performed at the end of the reporting year, Management has assessed that the exposure to changes in interest rates is minimal and hence the resulting impact on the profit or other comprehensive income of the Group is insignificant.

# (b) Financial risk management policies and objectives (cont'd)

# (iii) Credit risk management

The Group has minimal credit risk arising from its commuter transport operations as the majority of revenue is collected in cash upfront or from the transport regulator in the case of Singapore, United Kingdom and Australia. For the other operations, credit risk is also minimised via upfront deposits, strict credit terms and regular monitoring of debtors' financial standing. The Group enters into treasury transactions only with creditworthy institutions. Its investments in fixed income instruments are above investment grade as assigned by international credit-rating agencies. In its management of credit risk, the Group practises stringent credit review and sets counterparty credit limits. There is no significant concentration of credit risk.

Cash and deposits are kept with reputable financial institutions. There is no significant concentration of credit risk.

The carrying amount of financial assets represents the Group's maximum exposure to credit risk as disclosed in the notes to the Financial Statements.

The Group develops and maintains its credit risk gradings to categorise exposures according to their degree of risk of default. The Group uses its own trading records to rate its major customers and other debtors.

# (iv) Liquidity risk management

The Group funds its operations through a mix of internal funds and bank borrowings. It regularly reviews its liquidity position comprising free cash flows from its operations and credit lines from banks to ensure its ability to access funding at any time at the best possible rates.

# (v) Fuel price risk management

Fuel, comprising diesel and electricity, is part of the operating costs of the Group. The Group is also exposed to fluctuations in fuel price in its bus and rail operations and diesel and petrol sales business. The Group seeks to hedge the price risk associated with its fuel needs after considering fuel indexation in its contracts with various local authorities and uses hedging instruments, where necessary, to achieve the desired hedge outcome.

Based on sensitivity analysis performed and taking into account the fuel hedges in place, as at the end of the reporting year, every one percentage point change in the rates of diesel, petrol and electricity using the closing rates as at the end of the reporting year as a basis will impact the Group's annual fuel and electricity costs by  $0.5 million (2022:$ 0.5 million). The sensitivity analysis assumes that consumption is held constant at the same level as in 2023.

# (b) Financial risk management policies and objectives (cont'd)

# (vi) Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other current receivables and payables, provisions and other liabilities approximate their respective fair values due to the relatively short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The fair values of other classes of financial assets and liabilities are disclosed in the respective notes to the Financial Statements.

The Group classifies fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:

(a) quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1);  
(b) inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly (Level 2); and  
(c) inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (Level 3).

The majority of the fair value of the Group's investments are classified into Level 1. The Group's hedging instruments, if any, are classified into Level 2. Fair value of the financial instruments classified in Level 3 is insignificant. There are also no transfers between Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy during the financial year.

# (c) Hedging instruments

The Group utilises hedging instruments to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows.

The Group's hedging instruments are measured at fair value whereby future cash flows are estimated based on contracted rates and observable forward rates at the end of the reporting year, discounted at a rate that reflects the credit risk of the various counterparties.

At the end of the reporting year, the Group has outstanding fuel hedge with notional amounts totalling $11.9 million (2022: $27.2 million).

At the end of the reporting year, the Group has outstanding foreign exchange hedge with notional amounts totalling $3.2 million (2022: $11.0 million).

The fair value of the Group's hedging instruments, based on market prices for equivalent instruments at the end of the reporting year, comprised  $1.1 million of liabilities (2022:$ 0.7 million of liabilities) was matched by an equivalent fair value adjustment on cash flow hedges in Other Comprehensive Income.

The Group uses forward contracts and options to manage its exposure to foreign exchange risks. These arrangements are designed to address foreign exchange risk on future purchases of goods and are accounted for as cash flow hedges.

The Group uses fuel hedging contracts to manage its exposure to fuel price risks. These arrangements are designed to address fuel price exposure on future purchases of fuel and are accounted for as cash flow hedges.

# (d) Capital risks management policies and objectives

The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.

Management monitors the gross and net gearing of the Group and its implication on weighted average cost of capital in deciding the optimal capital structure. These objectives determine the Group's decisions on the amount of dividends to be paid to shareholders and the sources of capital to be raised, be it equity or debt. The Group's debt capital refers to borrowings comprising loans under Notes 16(a) and 16(b) and lease liabilities from financial institutions under Note 17 while equity refers to total equity.

No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 2023 and 2022.

# 36. DIVIDENDS

(a) During the current financial year, the Company paid dividends as follows:  
(b) Subsequent to the end of the financial year, the Directors of the Company recommended that a tax-exempt one-tier final dividend of 3.76 cents per ordinary share (2022: 1.76 cents per ordinary share) totalling $81.5 million. The dividends are subject to approval by shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and hence the proposed dividends have not been accrued as a liability for the current financial year.  

<table><tr><td></td><td>2023 $’mil</td><td>2022 $’mil</td></tr><tr><td>Tax-exempt one-tier final dividend in respect of the previous financial year - 1.76 cents (2022: 2.10 cents) per ordinary share</td><td>38.1</td><td>45.5</td></tr><tr><td>Tax-exempt one-tier interim dividend in respect of the current financial year - 2.90 cents (2022: 2.85 cents) per ordinary share</td><td>62.8</td><td>61.8</td></tr><tr><td>Tax-exempt one-tier special dividend in respect of the current financial year - 2.46 cents (2022: 1.41 cents) per ordinary share</td><td>53.3</td><td>30.5</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>154.2</td><td>137.8</td></tr></table>

Together with the tax-exempt one-tier interim dividend of 2.90 cents per ordinary share (2022: 2.85 cents per ordinary share), total distributions paid and proposed in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2023 will be 6.66 cents per ordinary share (2022: 8.48 cents per ordinary share including tax-exempt one-tier special dividends of 3.87 cents per ordinary share).

# 37. LICENCE FOR RAIL SERVICES

# Consolidated Rail Licence as part of NRFF (Version 2)

On 11 November 2022, a subsidiary of the Group, SBS Transit Ltd ("SBST") entered into a framework agreement with LTA and SBS Transit DTL Pte. Ltd. (now known as SBS Transit Rail Pte. Ltd.) to transit the DTL to NRFF (Version 2). Under this framework agreement, LTA will issue a Consolidated Rail Licence to SBS Transit Rail Pte. Ltd., to operate the DTL, NEL and SPLRT. The NRFF (Version 2) is designed to reduce commercial volatility for rail operators in delivering a reliable and financially sustainable public rail service.

The Consolidated Rail Licence took effect from 1 January 2022 to operate the NEL, SPLRT and the DTL for a period of 11 years. This Consolidated Rail Licence supersedes the licence granted to NEL, SPLRT dated 1 April 2018 and the licence granted to DTL dated 19 December 2013.

Under NRFF Version 2, LTA owns and pay for the operating assets, including additions, renewals and replacements. In exchange for the right to operate, maintain and derive revenue from the Licenced Systems, SBST will pay an annual licence charge to the LTA over the licence period. The licence charge structure under the NRFF provides for some sharing between SBST and LTA of the revenue risks under the Fare Revenue Shortfall Sharing as well as profit sharing via an Earnings Before Interest and Tax Cap/Collar. These are explained below:

# (i) Fare Revenue Shortfall Sharing ("FRSS")

The licence charge structure has a FRSS mechanism which offers some level of protection against revenue risks arising from uncertainties in ridership and fares. Under this mechanism, if the actual revenue falls short of the target revenue by  $2\%$  to  $6\%$ , LTA will share  $50\%$  of the shortfall. If the shortfall between the actual revenue and the target revenue exceeds  $6\%$ , LTA will bear  $75\%$  of the incremental revenue shortfall beyond  $6\%$ .

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

# 37. LICENCE FOR RAIL SERVICES (cont'd)

(ii) Earnings Before Interest and Tax ("EBIT") Cap/Collar

The licence charge structure provides for profit sharing via an EBIT (as computed in accordance with the licence agreement) cap and collar mechanism whereby LTA shares in the upside of the EBIT above the cap as well as the downside risks below the collar. If the EBIT margin is lower than  $3.50\%$ , LTA will share  $50\%$  of the shortfall. LTA's sharing of the shortfall is limited by the amount of licence charge payable by the SBS Transit Rail Pte.Ltd. for the year. If the EBIT margin exceeds the cap of  $5\%$ , the excess will be shared via a tiered structure, whereby  $85\%$  to  $95\%$  of the incremental EBIT above the  $5\%$  cap will be shared with LTA.

LTA's sharing under the FRSS and/or the EBIT Cap/Collar is limited by the amount of licence charge payable by the SBS Transit Rail Pte.Ltd. for the year.

In addition, the LTA may reimburse or be reimbursed by SBS Transit Rail Pte.Ltd. when new regulatory changes initiated by LTA after the transition lead to changes in operating costs or revenue. Regulatory changes that may impact operating costs or revenue include modifications to operating performance standards for the rail lines, maintenance performance standards for the operating assets, key performance indicators or codes of practice and changes in rentable and advertising spaces available for generating non-fare revenue.

# 38. CONTRACTS UNDER THE BUS CONTRACTING MODEL ("BCM")

A subsidiary of the Group, SBST entered into public bus services contracts (collectively known as the "Negotiated Contract") with LTA for the operation of public bus services under the BCM. The Negotiated Contract was effective from 1 September 2016 following the expiry of the Bus Service Operating Licence on 31 August 2016.

Under the BCM, LTA retains all fare revenue collected from the provision of the bus services.

Revenue for SBST is derived from the provision of bus services which comprises service fee and leasing fee. The service fee is indexed to changes in wage levels, inflation and fuel costs. In addition, SBST retains revenue from other commercial services comprising advertising and rental.

As part of the Negotiated Contract, SBST leases its fleet of close to 2,900 buses to LTA. In consideration of SBST using its fleet for the provision of the bus services, LTA pays a leasing fee based on the depreciation of the buses over the statutory lifespan. LTA also pays a leasing fee for the use of the other existing assets of SBST (bus depot and related equipment) based on the depreciation of such assets.

SBST performance will be assessed annually under an incentive-disincentive framework including key performance indicators such as bus service availability, bus punctuality and maintenances of buses, bus interchanges, bus depots and bus ticketing system.

In addition to operating and managing bus services to specified performance standards, SBST's responsibilities include the following:

(a) Operate, manage and maintain the buses and their on-board equipment;  
(b) Operate, and maintain the bus interchanges, bus depots including the equipment and systems therein;  
(c) Operate the buses, bus depots and related equipment that are provided by LTA for the provision of the Bus Services  
(d) Charge and collect fares as approved by the PTC, on behalf of LTA, for travel on the bus services;  
(e) Provide bus service information at all bus stops and bus interchanges served by the bus services; and  
(f) Provide customer management services, such as lost and found service, and a hotline for commuter feedback and enquiries.

The finalisation of the goodwill amount is dependent on the completion of the valuation of net assets acquired.

None of the goodwill arising from these acquisitions is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

# 41. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

In February 2024, the Group has acquired the entire issued share capital of CMAC Group Limited ("CMAC") for a total consideration of £80.2 million (approximately $135.4 million). The acquisition is aligned with the Group's growth plan as a global mobility leader and expands its footprint to 12 countries worldwide in the business of taxis and private-hire vehicles, public buses and inter-city coach services.

The financial information of CMAC at the acquisition date are currently unavailable. Based on CMAC's unaudited accounts as at 31 December 2023, the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on acquisition date are as follows:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Estimated fair value recognised on acquisition $’mil</td></tr><tr><td>Current assets</td><td>57.1</td></tr><tr><td>Non-current assets</td><td>43.0</td></tr><tr><td>Current liabilities</td><td>(65.9)</td></tr><tr><td>Net assets acquired and liabilities assumed</td><td>34.2</td></tr><tr><td>Provisional goodwill arising on acquisition</td><td>101.2</td></tr><tr><td>Purchase consideration</td><td>135.4</td></tr></table>

Acquisition-related transaction costs was S$1.2 million.

The Group is in the process of obtaining independent valuation to assist with the preparation of the Purchase Price Allocation ("PPA"). The valuation had not been completed as at the date of the financial statements. Any adjustments arising from the PPA, such as recognition of intangible assets or fair value adjustments would have a corresponding impact to the provisional goodwill.

If the acquisition had taken place on 1 January 2023, the additional revenue and profit before tax from CMAC would have been S$255.3 million and S$8.6 million respectively.

# NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING

# SPECIAL BUSINESS:

(f) Ordinary Resolution 10, if passed, will empower the Directors to offer and grant Awards under the Scheme in accordance with the provisions of the Scheme and to issue from time to time such number of fully paid Shares as many be required to be issued pursuant to the vesting of the Awards subject to the maximum number of Shares prescribed under the terms and conditions of the Scheme. The aggregate number of Shares which may be issued pursuant to the Scheme and any other share-based schemes (if applicable) shall not exceed in aggregate (for the entire duration of the Scheme) two per centum (2%) of the total number of issued Shares (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings) from time to time. The Scheme was approved at the AGM of the Company held on 26 April 2018.  
(g) Ordinary Resolution 11, if passed, will renew the Share Buyback Mandate, and empower the Directors to exercise all powers of the Company to purchase or otherwise acquire (whether by way of Market Purchases or Off-Market Purchases) Shares on the terms of the Share Buyback Mandate as set out in the Circular to Shareholders dated 28 March 2024 (the "Circular"), which is available at www.comfortdelgro.com.

The Company may use internal and external sources of funds to finance its purchases or acquisitions of Shares. The Directors do not propose to exercise the Share Buyback Mandate to such extent that it would result in any material adverse effect on the listing status of the Shares on the SGX-ST, liquidity and/or the orderly trading of the Shares and/or the financial position of the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Group"). The amount of financing required for the Company to purchase its Shares pursuant to the Share Buyback Mandate and the impact on the Company's financial position cannot be realistically ascertained as at the date of this Notice as this will depend on factors such as the aggregate number of Shares purchased, whether the Shares are purchased or acquired out of capital or profits, the purchase prices paid at the relevant times, and whether the Shares purchased or acquired are held in treasury or cancelled.

The rationale for the Share Buyback Mandate, the source of funds to be used for the Share Buyback Mandate, the impact of the Share Buyback Mandate on the Company's financial position, the implications arising as a result of the Share Buyback Mandate under The Singapore Code on Take-overs and Mergers and on the listing of the Company's Shares on the SGX-ST are set out in the Circular, which is enclosed together with this Notice.

An illustration of the total number of Shares which may be purchased or acquired by the Company up to the Maximum Limit, pursuant to the Share Buyback Mandate, is contained in paragraph 3.2.1 of the Circular.

An illustration of the maximum amount of financing or funds required for the purchase or acquisition of Shares up to the Maximum Limit at the relevant Maximum Price in the case of Market Purchases and an illustration of the maximum amount of financing or funds required for the purchase or acquisition of Shares up to the Maximum Limit at the relevant Maximum Price in the case of Off-Market Purchases, pursuant to the Share Buyback Mandate, are contained in paragraph 3.5.2(b) of the Circular.

An illustration of the financial impact of the purchase or acquisitions of Shares by the Company pursuant to the Share Buyback Mandate on the audited financial statements of the Group for the financial year ended 31 December 2023 is set out in the Circular.

A share buyback mandate (the "2023 Mandate") on the same terms was renewed at the AGM of the Company held on 28 April 2023. Details of the Company's acquisition of Shares pursuant to the 2023 Mandate are contained in paragraph 3.9 of the Circular.

# NOTES:

1. A proxy need not be a member of the Company. The Chairman of the Meeting, as proxy, need not be a member of the Company.  
2. Where a member appoints two (2) proxies, he/she should specify the proportion of his/her shareholding to be represented by each proxy, failing which the nomination shall be deemed to be alternative.  
3. A member, who is a relevant intermediary entitled to attend the meeting and vote, is entitled to appoint more than two (2) proxies to attend and vote instead of the member, but each proxy must be appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by each member. Where such member appoints more than two (2) proxies, the appointments shall be invalid unless the member specifies the number of shares in relation to which each proxy has been appointed.

"Relevant intermediary" means:

(a) a banking corporation licensed under the Banking Act 1970 of Singapore, or a wholly-owned subsidiary of such a banking corporation, whose business includes the provision of nominee services and who holds shares in that capacity;  
(b) a person holding a capital markets services licence to provide custodial services for securities under the Securities and Futures Act 2001 of Singapore, and who holds shares in that capacity; or  
(c) the Central Provident Fund Board ("CPF Board") established by the Central Provident Fund Act 1953 of Singapore, in respect of shares purchased under the subsidiary legislation made under that Act providing for the making of investments from the contributions and interest standing to the credit of members of the Central Provident Fund, if the CPF Board holds those shares in the capacity of an intermediary pursuant to or in accordance with that subsidiary legislation.

4. A member should insert the total number of shares held. If the member has shares entered against his/her name in the Depository Register (maintained by The Central Depository (Pte) Limited), he/she should insert that number of shares. If the member has shares registered in his/her name in the Register of Members of the Company, he/she should insert that number of shares. If the member has shares entered against his/her name in the Depository Register and shares registered in his/her name in the Register of Members, he/she should insert the aggregate number of shares. If no number is inserted, this form of proxy will be deemed to relate to all the shares held by the member.  
5. The instrument appointing a proxy, together with the power of attorney or other authority under which it is signed (if applicable) or a duly certified copy thereof, must be submitted in the following manner:

(a) If submitted by post, be deposited at the Company's registered office at 205 Braddell Road, Singapore 579701; or

6. The instrument appointing a proxy must be signed by the appointor or his/her attorney duly authorised in writing.
