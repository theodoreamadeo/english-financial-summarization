# Letter from the Chairman

"Our expansion into Asia has progressed with development works beginning on KL1 Kuala Lumpur, which will serve as a foundation stone for our expansion into other regional markets, where customer demand is apparent."

Douglas Flynn

CHAIRMAN

Welcome to NEXTDC's Annual Report for the fiscal year ended 30 June 2024. It has been another solid 12 months for the Company with our key financial metrics once again either meeting or exceeding guidance and demonstrating steady growth.

With the support of a successful capital raising during the reporting period we continue to scale our national platform to support customer growth requirements.

Our S3, M2 and M3 developments in Sydney and Melbourne continue to attract new contracted utilisation. Meanwhile, we recently completed the opening of the Company's new data centre facility D1 Darwin, and are due to open A1 Adelaide later in Q1 of FY25.

Put together, this means we are now close to completing our vision of providing an Australia-wide platform of premium data centres to support our national and global customers.

We also completed the construction of two edge data centres servicing Australia's largest mining region, the Pilbara in Western Australia. By introducing critical edge infrastructure via PH1 Port Hedland and NE1 Newman, we are enabling the mining industry to accelerate its application of digital technology megatrends to support business objectives.

Meanwhile, our expansion into Asia has progressed with development works beginning on KL1 Kuala Lumpur, which will serve as a foundation stone for our expansion into other regional markets, where customer demand is apparent.

We are also advancing well with our investment in Auckland where we are now targeting a larger, 15MW development in alignment with expected customer demand.

# Committed leadership team

There has been focused commitment across the whole team and its leadership during FY24. It is the quality of our people that continues to drive the growth of our business, as reflected in our record contracted utilisation, revenue, and underlying EBITDA results.

In an environment where our established hyperscale customers are racing to deploy infrastructure in support of their investments in cloud and Artificial Intelligence (AI), our sales, delivery, operational and customer services teams are well-positioned to support them.

Over 14 years of operation, we have developed a capability to quickly build and operationalise premium digital infrastructure, scaling as needed and providing the flexibility to meet bespoke customer configurations. Our proven track record of securing development land in optimal locations, where there is ample room to scale and ready access to power, enables us to meet critical customer needs and accelerate time-to-market.

These are core value propositions in today's data centre services market, allowing us to consistently deliver on contracted obligations with a focus on future growth requirements, customer experience, and sustainability.

Our core capabilities have become trusted by the industry and, as the demand for digital infrastructure has never been stronger, our role as a strategic partner and an economic enabler has never been more relevant.

# The future is bright

Our Asian expansion continues to gather momentum with the development of our  $\sim$ 1 billion Malaysian data centre underway. KL1 Kuala Lumpur will serve as our beachhead for growth in the region as we continue to explore a range of opportunities in key South East Asian economies where our key customers are looking to expand their services. For example, we are well advanced in planning NEXTDC's entry into Japan.

The demand for resilient, reliable, efficient data centre capacity continues to be underpinned by ongoing growth from cloud services and increasing adoption of enterprise colocation. These trends are not slowing down but they are being complemented and sharply accelerated by opportunity for growth driven by the broad adoption of AI.

We were very pleased with the level of confidence shown by our shareholders as they supported the Company through its recent $1.3 billion entitlement offer, with a take up of approximately 99 per cent and 82 per cent by our institutional and retail investors, respectively.

Through a combination of its 30 June 2024 cash balance of  $1,236 million as well as access to$ 1.5 billion of undrawn

debt facilities, NEXTDC finished FY24 with total liquidity of $2.7 billion, which leaves the Company well placed to continue investing in its growth pipeline.

# Good governance remains the key

In reflecting on the past year, I am pleased to highlight significant strides in strengthening our governance framework, ensuring robust compliance and effective risk management. This commitment to maintaining the highest governance standards has seen us implement regular reviews and updates to our policies and procedures, aligning them with best practices and regulatory requirements. Comprehensive oversight ensures that we remain vigilant and responsive to the dynamic regulatory landscape.

Our ongoing performance in these areas is important to maintaining the confidence of our customers, employees, investors and other stakeholders who are focused on our commitment to ethical and sustainable operating practices. Further details can be obtained via our FY24 Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Report and Corporate Governance Statement (CGS), both of which are now available on our website at

AI continues to fundamentally change the infrastructure requirements of many of our customers with traditional on-premise data centres increasingly unsuited to this technology shift.

High density computing - as is required by AI - comes with extremely complex and resilient power, cooling, security and interconnection requirements. These are the core brand promises that NEXTDC has been built upon.

# Increased sustainability focus

Increased compute density goes hand-in-hand with higher power consumption and the need for improved energy efficiency. We have continued to make progress on the sustainability front during FY24 including significant strides in advancing ESG commitments.

Aligning our strategy with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs) and embracing the Taskforce

on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) framework demonstrates our commitment to ethical, responsible and sustainable business practices. It also reflects our broader vision of driving meaningful change and contributing to a more sustainable and equitable world. Within our team we want to foster a diverse and inclusive workplace and are committed to providing a positive and supportive environment for all employees. The Board continues to oversee NEXTDC ESG performance to ensure it remains a strategic priority.

As we move forward, we remain steadfast in our commitment to excellence in innovation, governance, cybersecurity, and sustainability. These pillars guide our strategic direction, ensuring that we continue to create value for our shareholders while making a positive impact on society and the environment.

Thank you for your continued trust and support.

enabling businesses to thrive in this new era of technological advancement.

# The 4th industrial revolution

The rise of AI marks the onset of the fourth industrial revolution, or Industry 4.0. This era is defined by digital acceleration, advanced processing capabilities and complex, multi-faceted software, which demands specialised digital infrastructure. Organisations are increasingly seeking expert partners to unlock the potential of digital transformation and provide the infrastructure needed to capitalise on these emerging opportunities.

To thrive in the AI revolution, it is increasingly important for organisations to form partnerships with digital infrastructure specialists like NEXTDC. By colocating within the ecosystems these providers host, businesses can leverage cutting-edge infrastructure and robust ecosystems to stay ahead in the rapidly evolving digital landscape.

# Strategic NVIDIA partnership

NEXTDC is well positioned to play a foundational role in AI adoption in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region. We have established strategic alliances with companies such as NVIDIA, Dell and Lenovo. We have become the first Australian dataentre operator to be certified under NVIDIA's emerging DGX "AI Factories" standard.

Our S6 Sydney facility, whose acquisition and development we announced during this reporting period, will be designed and engineered as an AI Factory, underscoring our commitment to leading the digital

infrastructure market for AI in Australia and the broader Asia-Pacific region. S6 will support next-generation AI architectures, offering resilience, high-density power (up to 130kW per rack), flexible liquid cooling solutions, top-tier physical security, and the type of ultra-low latency, virtual interconnection platform necessary for large-scale AI data processing.

NEXTDC's extensive ecosystem comprising national and global cloud, carrier and digital services leaders, ensures that our collaborative partnerships will enable customers to deploy AI solutions of their choice.

# Enabling Australia's digital economy

Our dedication to fostering digital infrastructure for AI is the natural progression of our long-standing mission to be Australia's leading digital infrastructure platform, fuelling the digital economy. NEXTDC continues to be an enabler of partner ecosystems, supporting enterprise and Government customers by ensuring our premium facilities meet their evolving AI strategies.

There is no doubting that data centres are critical in shaping an AI-enabled world and NEXTDC is well positioned to play a pivotal role in shaping this future domestically and in the broader Asia-Pacific region. NEXTDC is investing to ensure our facilities are not only "where the cloud livesTM" but also "where AI thrivesTM".

# Meeting sustainability challenges head-on

NEXTDC's commitment to innovation is embodied in our continual innovation and improvement in electrical and mechanical systems, designed to meet the growing demands of digital acceleration while minimising the carbon footprint of high-density computing.

Our growth is accompanied by increased power consumption at the same time as government and enterprises increase the urgency to meet net zero carbon targets. In response to this, next generation capital works projects as well expansions and upgrades to existing facilities are designed and engineered to take these factors into account.

We will not be shy in contributing to the debate about low carbon energy transition options. When we consider the energy future of an exponentially growing data centre industry, it becomes increasingly apparent that renewables will not be the only solution needed for the 24x7x365 baseload requirements of our major cities, let alone the massive growth forecast in cloud computing, AI learning and AI inferencing models.

Renewables such as solar and wind will be critical to our customers' future energy consumption, and we will continue to invest in their generation. At the same time, we will continue exploring other clean energy alternatives for the reliable firming power our industry needs today and in the future as demand continues to grow exponentially.

As an insight to the future, our new facilities in Adelaide and Darwin are utilising next generation electrical setups

# Managing digital carbon footprints

With ongoing customer and societal concern about the expanding carbon footprints of IT infrastructure, alongside the growing adoption of AI and other compute-intensive technologies, our carbon offset program (NEXTneutral) is experiencing growth. We have continued to meet the requirements for our corporate operations to be  $100\%$  carbon neutral under the Climate Active scheme, administered by the Australian Federal

Department of Environment and Energy. This has been enabled through our strategic partnership with Qantas Future Planet (QFP) for offsetting carbon emissions.

# Elevating impact: aligning with the UN Sustainable Development Goals

FY24 marks a significant milestone as we align our business operations and goals with the United Nations Sustainable

Development Goals (SDGs). By integrating these globally recognised targets, we demonstrate our commitment to sustainable development and addressing critical global challenges. As a leader in digital infrastructure, we are uniquely positioned to contribute to these goals. We have identified six key SDGs where we believe we can make the greatest impact. These SDGs and their integration into our ESG initiatives are detailed in our FY24 ESG Report.

# Our Climate and Nature Commitment

NEXTDC recognises the interconnectedness of climate change and nature. In FY24, we have issued our inaugural Climate and Nature Report to explain our progress towards implementing our climate change commitments. It details our response to the risks and opportunities presented by climate change and nature in alignment with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD).

# Our approach to climate change

Climate change presents significant challenges to digital infrastructure, as extreme weather events, rising temperatures, and resource scarcity demand a departure from traditional design approaches. Infrastructure must be constructed to endure future climate conditions, including higher temperatures, more intense storms, and rising sea levels. NEXTDC is committed to addressing these climate risks. Our strategy emphasises transparency through climate-specific disclosures, the construction of sustainable and resilient data centres, the path towards net zero operations, and the maintenance of our external certifications such as the ISO14001 and NABERS. This approach ensures continuous improvement in resource efficiency, waste reduction, and overall environmental performance.

# Governance

The Audit and Risk Management Committee oversees the implementation and operation of NEXTDC's Risk Management Framework, including climate-related risks and opportunities. To further enhance our focus on sustainability, in FY24 we established an ESG Council to approve our ESG approach, objectives, and performance, including climate-related metrics and targets. Additionally, the appointment of a Head of Sustainability and a Head of Energy underscores our strategic focus on achieving our sustainability goals. This structured leadership approach ensures a coordinated and impactful execution of our climate objectives alongside our business operations.

# Risk management

We matured our risk management approach by linking the outcomes of our climate-related risks and opportunities to our business strategy. This includes conducting climate risk and opportunity workshops with key stakeholders, integrating climate-related risks into business unit reviews and enterprise risk registers, and monitoring climate metrics such as energy efficiency and emissions.

# Metrics and targets

We continue to develop metrics, pathways, and targets to track our progress in reducing emissions. Additionally, we are making strides toward our goal of procuring more renewable electricity for our operations and reducing our operational emissions.

# Strategy

Our business strategy provides the framework to achieve our climate ambition, including the finalisation of our net zero pathway and overarching three-year ESG strategy. We will begin a new phase of engagement with our customers and extended stakeholders to expand our disclosures and further inform the refinement of our strategic direction. In FY24, we built on our TCFD journey by enhancing our scenario analysis for priority risks by understanding the most significant climate-related threats to our operations. This included simulating a range of conditions to enable us to anticipate their impact, assess how they could affect our revenue, costs, and overall financial health. The following three scenarios were used to stress-test our business strategy:

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/0d69f478-7209-4e3f-85fe-955aa6c7338c/60fe0a8ff6aadd02478cd5ac2bfbddb45a2b6a4226aff52b3c48ea2d51461d0e.jpg)

Scenario 1: Globally on-track

Limiting the average global temperature increase to  $1.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  by 2100, aligned with the Paris Agreement.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/0d69f478-7209-4e3f-85fe-955aa6c7338c/636282922c95725e64df24e371bc8681d4b88ee05f288fbc657bc330bcf37b42.jpg)

Scenario 2: Business-As-Usual (BAU) baseline

Resulting in an average global temperature increase of  $2^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  to  $3^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  by 2100.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/0d69f478-7209-4e3f-85fe-955aa6c7338c/1314ff3d84389a8ce5e77b8e6c33c4e1cc3ff16184f17861677408460362a4bc.jpg)

Scenario 3: Ineffective Climate Action

Results in a climate shock with the average global temperature rising above  $3^{\circ}C$  by 2100.

# Looking forward

As the mandatory climate reporting legislation continues to be finalised in Australia, we will transition from the TCFD framework to align with these new requirements. We will also continue to analyse the new standards and identify the gaps between TCFD and mandatory disclosures. Our efforts include monitoring and refining our decarbonisation strategy and net zero pathway, with a focus on Scope 3 emissions, and improving scenario analyses to align with the forthcoming reporting framework. Additionally, we will conduct awareness sessions for our senior management and stakeholders on the enhanced requirements, highlighting the step-up from TCFD. Periodic reviews of climate-related risks and opportunities, especially site-based reviews for projects, will also be carried out.

# Our approach to nature

Climate and the atmosphere are subsets of nature, and the effects of increased carbon concentrations affect land, freshwater, oceans, and biodiversity.

Data centres interact with the environment in various ways - from the energy and water resources consumed to the physical footprint and impact on local ecosystems.

Although we operate in established metro zones with pre-existing ground disturbance, we recognise our operations, particularly new developments, have greater opportunity to be intertwined with the natural world.

We have assessed natural risks, stakeholder expectations, and regulatory

changes to optimise our environmental performance. Building on this, in FY24 we've enhanced our approach by adopting the TNFD framework to better understand and address our impact on nature.

Our initial steps in aligning with the TNFD framework utilised the LEAP approach (Locate, Evaluate, Assess, and Prepare):

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/0d69f478-7209-4e3f-85fe-955aa6c7338c/f24b6c53973faa0ec93022f80e4928a8c14ea7be3d9c79c900b6f9a82b45cce7.jpg)

Locate where our operations interact with nature. This includes assessing potential impacts on biodiversity, water resources, land use, and climate change.

Evaluate our dependencies on and impacts on natural ecosystems by understanding the reliance on ecosystem services for operations, such as cooling systems or material sourcing.

Assess nature-related risks and opportunities such as the potential business opportunities related to nature-positive solutions (e.g. renewable energy integration or green building certifications).

Prepare strategies to mitigate negative impacts, enhance positive contributions, and disclose relevant information to stakeholders in line with TNFD recommendations.

# Our progress to date

By conducting thorough due diligence from the beginning of our site selection process and incorporating ecological considerations into our design, construction, and operational processes, we aim to foster a positive relationship with nature. Nature-related risks, such as the increased frequency of extreme weather events, water scarcity, and biodiversity loss, are particularly relevant to the data centre industry, where stable environmental conditions are crucial for maintaining uninterrupted operations. For instance, we have identified that:

Healthy ecosystems provide essential services such as natural cooling through vegetation, water filtration, and climate regulation. Without these services, we face increased energy consumption for cooling and higher operational costs  
- The loss of natural buffers like wetlands and forests can heighten the risk of flooding, which threatens infrastructure integrity  
- The availability of critical natural resources, such as water, is vital for the technology used in data centres, and any disruption can pose significant risks to our operations

To adapt to these risks, we undertook risk assessments and aim to expand this to

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/0d69f478-7209-4e3f-85fe-955aa6c7338c/983bf153a085661ab4d2b09b7136dae45dcc08cfaf6ed8051dfafccae383dcf7.jpg)

site-based reviews for all new development projects. Our assessment identifies the following key nature-related risks, primarily through the expansion and operation of our data centres:

Stormwater regulation: Increasing requirements for managing extreme rainfall and flooding could raise costs for stormwater management, impacting new developments  
- Biodiversity regulation: Expanding in urban areas may face biodiversity challenges, leading to costs or delays  
- Water usage: Cooling equipment requires a significant amount of water demand as well as the management of wastewater

This approach, detailed in our Climate and Nature Report, outlines our current practices and progress while acknowledging areas for further development.

We see this first step towards TNFD alignment as a significant milestone. Over the next 12 months, we will deepen our understanding of how our sites interact with the ecosystems in which they are located, conduct awareness sessions on TNFD with senior management and other key stakeholders, and review the sectoral supplementary guidance released by TNFD to determine its relevance to our industry. Additionally, we will expand our scenario analysis to promote a nature-positive approach throughout our construction and operations.

# Frugal Not Cheap

We spend our money where it matters the most.

# Diversity, equity and inclusion

We believe our greatest strengths come from the people who make up our team. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) are core to our success strategy. We embrace our differences and diversity of identity, experience and ideas, pushing boundaries to promote inclusive behaviours across the Company.

NEXTDC is committed to providing a balanced and inclusive working environment supported by well-considered policies built on our Values. The Board has implemented a DEI Policy with measurable objectives to reflect our commitment to diversity at all levels of the organisation.

NEXTDC prides itself on the many individuals who bring unique and diverse skills, values, backgrounds, and attributes to the workplace, including their own personal experiences gained on account of their gender, age, ethnicity, or cultural background.

We believe that NEXTDC is an inclusive workplace where diversity thrives, and team members feel comfortable sharing their true selves. Please refer to the Company's FY24 ESG Report for more details on our continued efforts, achievements and strategic priorities

around diversity, equity and inclusion in FY24.

# Gender diversity

By 2030, NEXTDC intends to achieve a gender-balanced workforce with a target of at least  $40\%$  men and  $40\%$  women across all levels, from employees to management and the Board. In FY24, we had  $31\%$  female representation at the Company level.

The appointment of Maria Leftakis to our Board in August 2023 has further enhanced gender diversity on our Board, bringing the female representation to  $38\%$ , nearing our target of at least  $40\%$ .

Beyond achieving our gender ratio target, we are firmly committed to pay equity. As a relevant employer under the Workplace Gender Equality (WGEA) 2012, we actively address any pay gaps. In response to the recent Employer Gender Pay Gaps Report issued by the WGEA in February 2024, NEXTDC issued a Pay Gap Statement outlining our approach and action plan to closing the gender equality gap. Our annual remuneration reviews continue to prioritise equitable compensation, ensuring pay reflects performance, contributions, skills, and market benchmarks.

Further details on our diversity and inclusion related initiatives are captured

within the FY24 ESG Report with relevant policies available in the Corporate Governance section of the Company website at www.nextdc.com/investor-centre/corporate-governance.

# Giving back to communities

Our purpose is to help create opportunities for our future generations. We place immense value and take pride in the relationships we form in business and in the communities in which we live and work.

Our community 'Live to Give' project helps to support the lives of those around us. Live to Give brings together six charity and giving programs - The Smith Family, UN Women, SolarBuddy, Beyond Blue, Cancer Council and the Red Cross. We are also part of the Pledge  $1 \%$ movement and have an active workplace giving program with dollar- for- dollar donation matching for these six partner charitable organisations.

# Financial performance

NEXTDC achieved a number of significant milestones and enjoyed a period of steady growth in the 12 months to 30 June 2024.

While the Group generated a statutory loss after tax during FY24, this remains consistent with the Company incurring upfront costs linked to its rapid expansion program such as depreciation and finance expense ahead of generating increased revenues from those investments. In FY24 NEXTDC incurred a total of  $167.7 million in depreciation charges (up from$ 140.1 million $^5$  in FY23) and $92.0 million in finance costs (up from  $73.1 million$ ^5 in FY23).

The Group experienced strong growth in revenue in FY24, as well as further strong growth in contracted and billing utilisation over the same period. As at 30 June 2024, NEXTDC was billing for 86.0MW (2023: 77.7MW) of capacity and had a forward order book of  $86.6\text{MW}^4$ , which is expected to convert into revenue across FY25 to FY29.

A summary of consolidated revenues and segment EBITDA for the year is set out below:

<table><tr><td rowspan="3"></td><td colspan="2">Segment revenues</td><td colspan="2">Segment EBITDA</td></tr><tr><td>30 June 2024</td><td>30 June 2023</td><td>30 June 2024</td><td>30 June 2023</td></tr><tr><td>$&#x27;000</td><td>$&#x27;000</td><td>$&#x27;000</td><td>$&#x27;000</td></tr><tr><td>Vic</td><td>129,354</td><td>117,404</td><td>92,289</td><td>86,130</td></tr><tr><td>NSW/ACT</td><td>203,689</td><td>182,915</td><td>123,037</td><td>112,731</td></tr><tr><td>Rest of Australia</td><td>67,721</td><td>58,644</td><td>46,070</td><td>40,894</td></tr><tr><td>International</td><td>98</td><td>144</td><td>(1,904)</td><td>(2,105)</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>3,475</td><td>3,262</td><td>878</td><td>2,054</td></tr><tr><td>Total segment</td><td>404,337</td><td>362,369</td><td>260,370</td><td>239,704</td></tr></table>

Net profit/(loss) after tax was $(44.1) million (2023: $(22.0)5 million).

Non-statutory underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) improved from  $193.7 million in FY23 to$ 204.3 million in FY24. Reconciliation of statutory profit to EBITDA and underlying EBITDA is as follows:

Cash and cash equivalents at 30 June 2024 totalled  $1,236 million (2023:$ 766 million), which combined with the undrawn senior syndicated debt facility of $1.5 billion, provided the Group access to $2.7 billion in available liquidity at 30 June 2024.

NEXTDC's balance sheet position is underpinned by approximately $5.2 billion in total assets.

# Sales performance

We have continued to focus our sales strategy on partnering and forming alliances with providers of infrastructure, platforms and packaged services. The flexibility we offer by being carrier and vendor neutral allows customers a choice of carriers and systems integrators, creating a unique ecosystem of enterprise, Government and ICT service provider customers.

During the year NEXTDC increased its contracted utilisation by  $41\%$  from 122.2MW at the end of FY23 to 172.6MW at the end of FY24 (pro forma for the announcement of 6 August 2024).

NSW/ACT's contracted utilisation increased by 22.2MW during FY24 to 103.0MW as at 30 June 2024 (pro forma for the announcement on 6 August 2024), with contracted utilisation accounting for  $131\%$  of built capacity (78.7MW).

Our contracted utilisation in Victoria grew by 25MW to 58.1MW during the period from 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024, with contracted utilisation accounting for  $90\%$  of built capacity (64.5MW).

Contracted utilisation for the rest of Australia grew 3.4MW during FY24 to 11.6MW as at 30 June 2024, with contracted utilisation accounting for  $53\%$  of built capacity (21.9MW).

NEXTDC continues to develop its go-to-market strategy through channel and alliance partnerships with major telecommunications and IT service providers, allowing it to increase the breadth and depth of its selling capability without adding to its sales operating cost base.

# Continuous innovation

As a leading player in Australia's rapidly evolving IT infrastructure sector, NEXTDC is committed to ongoing innovation and improvement of its systems, products, and services. All data centres have achieved and continue to be certified to ISO 27001 Information Security Management System, ISO 9001 Quality Management System, ISO 14001 Environmental Management System and ISO 45001 for WHS Management System. These certifications confirm that NEXTDC has an integrated management system that provides a systematic approach to risk management, protection of company information and continuous improvement. Exceptions to this are NEXTDC's edge data centres in the Sunshine Coast (SC1), Darwin (D1), Newman (NE1), and Port Hedland (PH1). While not formally certified, these facilities adhere to national standards aligned with relevant management systems. Our intention is to complete this process within the next 12 months, where this is applicable to the service we provide.

Ongoing customer demand has seen NEXTDC develop innovative ways to augment data centre capacity beyond the original designs with higher power densities and additional data halls. Even though power consumption is increasing as our facilities become more populated, their overall energy efficiency has improved over time through economies of scale and increased utilisation of existing infrastructure.

NEXTDC continuously tests and tunes its data centres to optimise energy efficiency and stability and ensure that PUE targets are achieved. In FY24, NEXTDC achieved an average PUE of 1.42 across all its data centres.

Energy efficiency and sustainability remain key areas of focus for the Group. Our data centre facilities have been engineered to deliver extremely high energy efficiency, lowering the carbon footprint for our customers. NEXTDC has achieved industry-leading energy efficiency with NABERS 5-star ratings for our M1 Melbourne and S1 Sydney data centres, pioneering this standard in Australia. Our P1 Perth facility has also excelled, earning a 4.5-star rating; and we are committed to expanding these achievements across our fleet.

Leveraging cutting-edge engineering and continuous optimisation, our second-generation data centres deliver industry-leading energy efficiency. Our third-generation facilities are designed to surpass these benchmarks again. In FY24, we undertook our first embodied carbon assessment for new builds, establishing a template for future projects. This critical, early-stage evaluation enables us to engage with delivery partners effectively, accelerating our progress toward net-zero across our value chain.

As facilities approach full capacity and incremental cooling infrastructure is no longer needed, rooftop solar becomes an option at some sites. NEXTDC owns and operates its solar array on the roof of its M1, S1, P1, SC1, and M3 data centres and has been a Principal Partner of the Melbourne Renewable Energy Project (MREP) since its inception in 2014.

# Business strategies and prospects for future financial years

The Group continues to develop a strong and growing pipeline of sales opportunities across its operating markets. Based on the number of positive demand trends such as cloud and mobile computing, growth in internet traffic and data sovereignty as well as the adoption of new technologies such as generative AI, we expect that demand for carrier and vendor neutral outsourced data centre services will continue to grow strongly for the foreseeable future.

The Company has a number of strategies to benefit from this growth, including but not limited to:

Continuing to sell capacity in existing facilities;  
- Growing its presence in existing data centre markets where its existing facilities are close to being fully utilised;  
- Expanding its footprint into new data centre markets in Australia, such as Adelaide, Darwin, Port Hedland and Newman;  
- Expanding its presence into new offshore markets such as New Zealand and Malaysia; and  
Launch of new products.

Based on the factors listed above, the Group expects its revenue to continue growing in the foreseeable future.

# Business risks

NEXTDC prioritises a robust risk management framework as a cornerstone of its corporate governance. This framework is crucial for achieving both strategic and operational goals. We continually assess enterprise risks against the Board-approved Risk Appetite Statement. Risk management systems and processes are implemented to identify potential risks early, enabling proactive management strategies.

For a deeper dive into the roles, objectives, and processes involved, please refer to our internal Risk Management Procedure and guidelines. Additionally, the Company's most recent Corporate Governance Statement (available at www.nextdc.com) provides details on NEXTDC's comprehensive Risk Management Framework.

The following key business risks have remained focus areas, as they can adversely affect the Company's financial performance:

# Business Management and Governance

- Fraud, Bribery and Corruption: Fraud, bribery, and any unethical conduct poses a significant risk to NEXTDC's reputation and the trust of our customers, shareholders, and stakeholders. To mitigate this risk, NEXTDC has embedded a governance framework, including a Board-approved Statement of Delegated Authority, into our business operations. All employees and Directors undergo comprehensive Code of Conduct training, and we encourage a culture of openness through our Whistleblower Policy, which empowers staff to report any suspected misconduct.  
- Training and Development: Operating and maintaining data centres demands a highly skilled workforce. Insufficient training can compromise safety, the environment and operational efficiency of our facilities and employee morale. To address these issues, NEXTDC provides comprehensive training and development programs for all team members, including on-the-job training and regular refreshers. For further details on our training initiatives, please refer to the Human Capital Development section of our ESG Report located on our website under the Corporate Governance Section (www.nextdc.com).  
- Technology Advances: NEXTDC operates in a highly competitive industry where staying at the forefront of technology and business systems is essential to maintain customer satisfaction and market share. We foster strategic partnerships and collaborative research with suppliers, actively participate in industry forums, and maintain membership with leading industry bodies such as the Uptime Institute. Our dedicated Business Transformation Program ensures we are continually evolving to meet the needs of our customers.  
- Employee Engagement: An engaged workforce is critical to achieving our strategic goals. By fostering a culture that attracts and retains employees who share our values, we can build a strong foundation for success. NEXTDC's 'The Way We Work' program continues to provide ongoing flexibility to our team, recognising no one-size-fits-all solution to how we work. For a more in-depth look at our social sustainability efforts, please refer to the ESG Report on our website under the Corporate Governance Section (www.nextdc.com).

# Environment, Work Health, and Safety

Workplace, Health and Safety: Our employees are the cornerstone of NEXTDC's success, and their safety and well-being are paramount. We are committed to fostering a secure and healthy workplace for all stakeholders. Our unwavering focus on achieving zero workplace injuries is underscored by our ISO 45001 certification.

NEXTDC maintained a very positive safety result for FY24, with zero Lost Time Injuries Frequency Rate (LTIFR) and zero Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) for our operations.

Active management of WHS issues, both in the operation of data centres and in their development, is mandated and central to creating a culture where it is safe to speak up and report any hazards or incidents. NEXTDC has also sought to implement a process of continual review through its safety assurance programs.

Our strategy for providing a safe workplace also focuses on protecting people from harm by identifying and managing workplace risks to mental health, building the capacity to respond and support people experiencing mental ill-health, and promoting positive mental health and wellbeing. To enhance our mental health support, we've established a network of volunteer Mental Health First Aid Officers (MHFOs) across our facilities. Our MHFOs are trained professionals who can provide initial assistance to colleagues experiencing mental health challenges. With 46 dedicated MHFOs across Australia and the Asia-Pacific region, we're committed to fostering a supportive and caring workplace.

As part of prioritising employee well-being, this year, we launched our inaugural "People at Work" survey to gain a comprehensive understanding of employee wellbeing and safety. We're thrilled with the results, placing us in the "minimal concern" quadrant, the most positive category. The valuable feedback gained from this, and our bi-annual employee survey is guiding our efforts in creating an even healthier and more productive work environment for all our employees.

In addition, our partnership with Sonder provides our team and their families with 24/7 access to medical, mental health, and safety experts. This comprehensive support system complements our safety programs and contributes to a positive and supportive work environment.

NEXTDC's Construction Safety Management System is continually incorporating lessons learned from our design, construction, and operations teams to ensure that new facilities incorporate the most relevant safety standards. This proactive approach strengthens our safety culture and drives continuous improvement.

Energy Usage and Emissions: NEXTDC is committed to operating our data centres with maximum energy efficiency and minimal environmental impact. While increased customer demand inevitably leads to higher overall energy consumption, our facilities are meticulously designed, engineered, and managed to optimise performance and reduce our carbon footprint.

We have invested significantly in cutting-edge technologies and operational improvements to achieve industry-leading energy efficiency. Our pursuit of NABERS certification for all data centres, coupled with stringent PUE targets, underscores this commitment. In FY24, we achieved a national average PUE of 1.42.

# Maintain 100% Uptime Guarantee

- Unable to Provide Service: Data centre failures can disrupt operations and breach service level agreements. To prevent this, NEXTDC builds high-redundancy facilities with backup power and cooling systems. Regular testing, expert design, and external certifications ensure uninterrupted service and meet our  $100\%$  uptime commitment.

# Building New Sites/Data Centres

- Development: NEXTDC is actively expanding its data centre footprint through new developments, facility expansions, as well as Edge and remote site deployments in Australia and overseas. Development projects typically involve a range of risks, including:

(i) the risk that suitable sites or required planning consents and regulatory approvals, including approvals from the local water authority and the local power distribution grid operator, are not obtained or, if obtained, are received later than expected or are adverse to NEXTDC's interests, or are not properly adhered to;  
(ii) Development costs exceeding initial projections, including construction, fit-out, and related delays.  
(iii) Unforeseen project delays, supply chain disruptions, or delays in critical infrastructure or component deliveries.; and  
(iv) non-performance/breach of contract by a contractor or subcontractor in relation to any of the above. Increases in the supply or falls in demand for data centre capacity could influence the acquisition of sites, the timing and value of sales, and the carrying value of projects.

To mitigate these risks, NEXTDC has implemented standardised processes for planning, designing, engineering, procuring, and managing its development projects.

- Customer Demand: Data centre development requires significant capital investment and often precedes customer commitments. To mitigate the risk of insufficient demand, NEXTDC focuses on aligning site development with market trends and customer needs. Our strategy of becoming the largest independent, carrier-neutral channel ecosystem in the Asia-Pacific region supports this approach. By adopting a more scalable data centre design, we can optimise capital expenditure and closely match infrastructure investment with customer growth. Additionally, expanding our product and service offerings aims to increase revenue and overall business performance.

# Ensuring Financial Health of the Company

Funding: NEXTDC's business is capital-intensive in nature, and our continued growth relies on the acquisition and development of new and existing data centres, along with investment in new technologies. Failure to obtain sufficient capital on favourable terms may hinder NEXTDC's ability to expand and pursue growth opportunities, which may reduce competitiveness and have an adverse effect on financial performance. To address this risk, NEXTDC has sought to obtain funding from various sources to not become over-reliant on any one form of funding, as well as to maintain adequate liquidity to be able to cope with surges in customer demand as well as to take advantage of any attractive investment opportunities.

# Security of Data and Information

Physical Security Breach: Physical security is the foundation of data centre security. It forms the basis of our security strategy and is integrated into NEXTDC's governance and operations. A breach could seriously interfere with NEXTDC's or its customers' operations, damaging their reputation and ours. NEXTDC's security risk management program is designed to safeguard our assets, people, property and information as well as customer equipment, security and operational environments. NEXTDC customers rely on our physical security to prevent unauthorized access to the space where their equipment resides. NEXTDC seeks to provide customers with the highest standards of security. NEXTDC employs a multi-layered security approach to safeguard our data centres. Access is strictly controlled at every level, from the perimeter to individual data halls. Continuously adapting to evolving threats, our security measures protect the integrity of customer data.

- Privacy & Data Security: NEXTDC collects minimal PII for account management, marketing, and facility access. We do not handle customer data stored within our facilities; data security remains the customer's responsibility. All PII is managed securely in compliance with data protection regulations and ISO 27001 standards. While a data breach impacting NEXTDC's operations could harm our reputation, our Certified Strategic Enclave status, awarded by the Australian Federal Government's Digital Transformation Agency, underscores our commitment to the highest security and data sovereignty standards.  
- Cyber Risk: Cyber resilience is an important element of customer data security. Our Security Operations Centre proactively defends against cyber threats, supported by an ISO 27001-compliant framework. Regular third-party audits ensure our security measures remain robust and effective.

# Revenue Generation and Customer Growth

- Customer Management: NEXTDC is committed to building a culture that values our customers and provides the best experience for them, from the first to the last point of contact. This is central to all phases of the customer lifecycle. Besides measuring ourselves against key customer metrics, we continue to evolve our customer resourcing models to ensure we deliver great service and monitor the outcomes and feedback.  
- Meeting Customer Requirements: NEXTDC serves a sophisticated customer base comprised of large, established businesses with varied expectations. Timely delivery of tailored solutions is crucial for maintaining our strong brand reputation and securing future business. To meet these demands, we leverage our in-house engineering and project management expertise to optimise solutions and ensure on-time, on-budget delivery. Dedicated Customer Success Managers support our customers throughout their journey, from initial engagement to becoming valued customers.  
- Innovating to Stay Competitive: Innovation is a core driver of NEXTDC's success. Our strategic focus on research and development fuels innovation across data centre design, development, and operations. By maintaining close relationships with our customers, we gain invaluable insights into industry trends and customer needs, enabling us to deliver solutions that drive value and maintain our competitive edge.

# Likely developments and expected results of operations

Likely developments in the operations of the Group that were not finalised at the date of this report include the continued fit out of data centre capacity in existing facilities and the pursuit of further growth opportunities.

# Dividends

In considering dividend policy the Board considers the demand for capital to invest in growth, its level of retained earnings and the availability of franked earnings.

Although the Company is expanding operating cashflow, NEXTDC is some way from paying tax and consequently from generating franking credits. The Company continues to experience strong demand for its services and consequently is continuing to make substantial capital investment into the business. It is unlikely that NEXTDC will pay any dividend in the next two years.

Dividends were neither paid nor declared during the year.

# Environmental regulation

NEXTDC is constantly monitoring and revising the best way to manage our data centres to minimise the environmental impact.

We diligently monitor and adhere to environmental regulations at both national and state levels across all our facilities. Supported by ISO 14001 certification, we conduct regular internal audits and external legislative reviews to maintain compliance.

The FY24 Environmental, Social and Governance Report (located at www.nextdc.com) provides further details on how NEXTDC addresses matters of environmental and social sustainability.

# Greenhouse gas and energy data reporting requirements

NEXTDC tracks carbon emissions for reporting purposes and is registered under the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (NGER) Act.

Additionally, NEXTDC has maintained its  $100\%$  carbon-neutral certification for corporate operations under the Australian Government's Climate Active program by continuing to offset associated emissions.

NEXTDC's NEXTneutral, a certified carbon-neutral colocation solution offered as an opt-in product to our customers, allows our customers to voluntarily offset their carbon footprint to be  $100\%$  carbon neutral on the same basis as NEXTDC's own certification.

# NEXTDC's Climate Change Journey and Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) implementation

Refer to our FY24 Climate and Nature Report for further details on our alignment with the recommendations of TCFD. This year, we have also made a positive start towards integrating the recommendations of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) framework to assess and address nature-related financial risks and opportunities. This is further detailed in our Climate and Nature Report.

# Insurance of officers

During the period, NEXTDC Limited paid a premium of  $2,635,378 (FY23:$ 3,365,500) to cover its Directors and Officers.

The liabilities insured include legal costs incurred in defending civil or criminal proceedings that may be brought against individuals in their capacity as officers of entities in the Group and any other liabilities or amounts sought against them in connection with such proceedings. This does not include liabilities that arise from conduct involving a wilful breach of duty by the officers or the improper use by the officers of their position or of information to gain advantage for themselves or someone else or to cause detriment to the Group. The Directors & Officers Liability insurance also covers security claims against the Company. It is not possible to apportion the premium between amounts relating to the insurance against legal costs to defend the officers and those relating to other liabilities.

# Proceedings on behalf of the Company

No person has applied to the Court under section 237 of the Corporations Act 2001 for leave to bring proceedings on behalf of the Group, or to intervene in any proceedings to which the Group is a party, for the purpose of taking responsibility on behalf of the Group for all or part of those proceedings.

No proceedings have been brought or intervened in on behalf of the Group with leave of the Court under section 237 of the Corporations Act 2001.

# Rounding of amounts

The Company is of a kind referred to in ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191, relating to the 'rounding off' of amounts in the financial statements. Amounts in the financial statements have been rounded off in accordance with that Class Order to the nearest thousand dollars, or in certain cases, to the nearest dollar.

# 1.MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIR OF THE REMUNERATION AND NOMINATION COMMITTEE

NEXTDC's Remuneration Report details how its executive remuneration outcomes are linked to both its corporate and individuals' performance for the 2024 financial year. The report details our remuneration policy for FY24 and the alignment between executive remuneration and shareholder outcomes.

In FY24, NEXTDC achieved a number of key performance milestones:

<table><tr><td>Total revenue</td><td>Underlying EBITDA1</td><td>Operating cashflow</td></tr><tr><td>$404.3M</td><td>$204.3M</td><td>$128.8M</td></tr><tr><td>▲ $42.0M (12%)</td><td>▲ $10.6M (5%)</td><td>▲ $2.3M (2%)</td></tr><tr><td>Contracted utilisation2</td><td>Debt Facility</td><td>Capital expenditure</td></tr><tr><td>172.6MW</td><td>$2.9B</td><td>$1,003M</td></tr><tr><td>▲ 50.5MW (41%)</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>

The Remuneration and Nomination Committee (the 'Committee') has continued to direct the Company's approach to remuneration practices and monitor industry market conditions throughout the year to ensure management continues to be in a position to achieve its strategic objectives. The retention of key talent in high-performance environments such as in the rapidly evolving data centre industry has always been a key element of protecting shareholder value, even more so in view of the rapid rise of AI, which is now further heating the sector. The Committee is mindful of the need to balance the needs of NEXTDC as a high-performance business focused on growth objectives with broader community expectations on remuneration practises.

The Committee is also aware of broader trends in the executive space and is mindful of competitors and comparator groups in Australian and international markets, including unlisted competitors. Each year the Committee commissions comparative analysis for KMP and Non-Executive Directors of like sized public enterprises and, so far as is possible, of similar unlisted businesses. Given that many of our major competitors are either subsidiaries of international companies or privately held with limited disclosure obligations, making any like for like comparisons is challenging. However, we do have data points where we seek to recruit directly from the sector or where our staff are either recruited or approached, as well as from limited disclosures contained in privately owned data centre company accounts.

This year's Senior Executive remuneration program set performance targets with reference to key project milestones and shareholder expectations. Financial performance, key business deliverables and broader ESG components such as behavioural, health and safety metrics were incorporated into the program. The Committee is focused on driving operational efficiencies and positive environmental outcomes as part of the Company's strategic agenda.

The Committee continues to reflect on the need to balance its disclosures on operational performance with the need for confidentiality on commercially sensitive initiatives. It believes there is a clear benefit in providing as much transparency as possible but will, at times, be circumspect about some of the details. Feedback received from shareholders indicates we have the balance about right. Accordingly, for now, we are continuing with this approach whilst also seeking your views to make continual refinements to balance these issues.

# FY24 Outcomes

Following a review of Senior Executive remuneration conducted towards the end of FY23, the Board approved a  $15\%$  increase in fixed remuneration for Senior Executives, including the CEO, effective from 1 July 2023. This reflected the Senior Executives' demonstrated contribution towards the Company's global strategic growth, benchmarked against regional management levels in Asia and privately owned peers in Australia, as well as taking into account a  $14\%$  increase in the Australian Consumer Price Index since the previous increase in fixed remuneration in January 2021.

The talent market in our industry remains highly competitive, with a limited pool of experienced individuals. As a result of the interest our Senior Executives continue to attract from competitors both locally and internationally, modifications were also made to the FY24 long-term incentive (LTI) plan to further generate Senior Executive share ownership and alignment with long-term shareholder interests, while continuing to aid in motivating and retaining high performing, innovative Senior Executives.

As disclosed in the FY23 Notice of Meeting, the LTI adjustments this year were driven, to an extent, by the inequity of LTI rights not vesting in September 2023, in circumstances where the Company had experienced a record year in sales and facility growth. Unfortunately, due to external market conditions, NEXTDC's strong financial outcomes were not reflected in relative TSR performance over the measurement period for the FY21 LTI award, with no awards vesting for Senior Executives and other senior management. The lapsing of the FY21 LTI, in conjunction with significant competition for talent in the industry, has created substantial retention risks for NEXTDC. The Board determined that, to retain key executives and properly align their interests with shareholders, incorporating a Restricted Rights component into the LTI structure would address these priorities. To ensure the Restricted Rights award remains strongly aligned with shareholder value, it includes an underlying absolute TSR vesting condition. This pivot aims to better stabilise the incentives for longer-term performance, and to this end we were strongly supported by shareholders at the AGM.

We believe that the LTI miss may have played a role in some turnover in key positions, with several senior executive team members in the group immediately below the KMP deciding to leave the Company to join competitors or customers over the past 12 months.

# Looking forward - Senior Executive remuneration in FY25

To ensure the remuneration framework remains fit-for-purpose for the next phase of the Company's strategy and growth, the Committee undertook a review of the existing Senior Executive remuneration in FY24, with input from external advisors including benchmarking against the Domestic Industry Peer Group and Market Capitalisation Peer Group (S&P/ASX 100 index). The review considered several factors, including prevailing economic conditions, the trajectory of the Company's growth, current and future strategic priorities, scarcity of key executive talent and the appropriateness of the current framework in meeting industry opportunities and risks.

Following the review, the Board has determined to direct a  $10\%$  increase in fixed remuneration for KMP, including the CEO, effective 1 July 2024. The increase in fixed remuneration is considered modest considering the continuing increase in complexity of the business and the competition for talent in the sector and remains at the lower to midpoint of the benchmark compared to peers based on market capitalisation. Further, and in particular in response to rewards available among direct competitors, the Company plans to increase the STI opportunity for KMP to up to  $150\%$  of fixed remuneration as well as increase the LTI opportunity for the CEO from  $150\%$  to  $200\%$  of fixed remuneration, with vesting conditions to be on the same basis as approved at the 2023 AGM. These changes reflect their demonstrated contribution towards the Company's global strategic growth, including a  $64\%$  increase in market capitalisation during FY24 (FY23:  $33\%$ ).

A change is also proposed to replace 'Gross Revenue' with 'Net Revenue<sup>3</sup> for the purpose of the measurement of STI and as a key guidance metric in FY25 and beyond. The Company reports both metrics but the Committee considers that Net Revenue more closely reflects the Company's growth in new business as it adjusts for the distorting impact of power pass-through revenue, which is significantly influenced by movements in the market price of energy, a factor much outside the control of the Company.

While the Committee and the Board have sought to accommodate Australian public company norms, our competitors aren't owned by Australian public investors and consequently that measurement has become increasingly irrelevant and inappropriate in the competition for talent and experience. While the data is not always transparent in comparator groups, it is apparent that the privately funded data centre operators offer remuneration packages that are many times larger than what is proposed here. Further, while retention is critically important, the Company is also in the market recruiting for new senior positions. In this regard we are frequently uncompetitive. This simply reflects the reality of the market for talent in this fast-growing, high capex sector, operating mostly outside Australian public company ownership.

The Committee and I are looking forward to further engaging with our shareholders and will be listening carefully to your comments and observations concerning our remuneration policies and practices.

# 3. OVERVIEW OF REMUNERATION GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK

Our mission is to be the leading customer-centric data centre services company, delivering solutions that power, secure and connect enterprise. NEXTDC's remuneration policy is designed to incentivise and reward Senior Executives for achieving its overarching objectives of building market-leading sales performance, hosting the country's largest independent ecosystem of carriers, cloud and IT service providers and enabling customers to source and connect with suppliers and partners in an integrated hybrid cloud environment.

Our remuneration framework, applicable to the 2024 financial year, is outlined and summarised below.

# 3.1 Senior Executive Remuneration (SER) Policy

The Senior Executive Remuneration Policy applies to Senior Executives who are defined as:

The Chief Executive Officer who is accountable to the Board for the Company's performance and long-term planning;  
- Heads of Business Units, or those with key functional roles, or essential expertise, that report directly to the Chief Executive Officer;  
- Other executive roles classified as KMP under the Corporations Act; and  
Other roles or individuals nominated by the Board from time to time.

FIGURE 1: REMUNERATION GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK

The SER policy details how executive remuneration is structured, benchmarked and adjusted in response to changes in the circumstances of the Company. NEXTDC's Senior Executives Total Remuneration Package (TRP) includes the following components:

FIGURE 2: TOTAL FY24 REMUNERATION (IF MAXIMUM INCENTIVE PAYMENTS ARE RECEIVED)

# 3.2 Senior Executive Remuneration Benchmarks

When considering executive remuneration, the Committee frequently has reference to domestic and international industry benchmarks relevant to its market sector, growth and value as well as unlisted competitors, general market conditions and the individual's role and performance. Factors specific to the data centre industry are also evaluated to ensure a high degree of alignment with strategic goals and to foster high retention rates in the leadership team and in the business more broadly. The Committee continues to be mindful of strong and ongoing competitive pressures for top talent in the sector both internationally and locally. The Committee considerations include the following fundamentals in setting executive remuneration packages:

The individual's skillsets and contribution to long term revenue and EBITDA growth;  
Their contribution to the delivery of key strategic goals and milestones;  
Their contribution to key measures of operational excellence including those relating to running of the business, the Company's strategic initiatives, safety and cultural values;  
Their relevant industry knowledge, experience and connections;  
- Domestic and international comparators with whom NEXTDC must compete for talent; and  
- Prevailing economic conditions.

As outlined in the Chairman's comments, during FY23, the Committee undertook a review of the Senior Executive remuneration framework, in line with movements in the Australian Consumer Price Index, as well as the trajectory of the Company's growth, strategic objectives and priorities, scarcity of talent, changes in roles and complexity, and NEXTDC's increasing geographical spread. Following this review, the Board approved a  $15\%$  increase in fixed remuneration for Senior Executives (including the CEO) for FY24, taking into account their demonstrated contribution towards the Company's growth, reflected by a  $33\%$  increase in the Company's market capitalisation since the end of FY22 (44% since the start of FY21). The review also considered appropriate benchmarking against regional management levels in Asia as well as privately owned peers in Australia (recognising that NEXTDC competes for talent with both listed and unlisted companies).

The Committee's view is that the nature of the business and its local and international customer base, relationships and competitors are such that its TRP levels should continue to be assessed against both domestic and international remuneration benchmarks.

# 3.3 Senior Executive Remuneration Mix

The Senior Executive remuneration mix refers to the proportion of remuneration that can be achieved as fixed versus any variable "at risk" remuneration component. Assuming performance is at a level at which incentives pay out in full, approximately  $71\%$  of the TRP remuneration received is performance related.

The graph below sets out the remuneration mix if maximum incentive payments are received for the CEO and other Senior Executives for FY24.

# 3.4 Senior Executive Remuneration and Performance

The Board has determined that significant remuneration opportunities should continue to be contingent on realising the Company's ongoing financial and operational objectives. The Committee is disclosing further detail in relation to how incentive outcomes were determined in FY24 to ensure shareholders gain an appropriate level of insight into the key strategic and project milestones set for Senior Executives remuneration. The Committee is aiming to set these to ensure NEXTDC's executive continue to be focused on developing and growing its first-class data centre business, customer success and expanding its national and international network of data centres. These remain the key drivers for shareholder value creation and continue to be the cornerstones of our incentive program.

# 3.5 Variable remuneration – Short Term Incentive (STI) Plan

The Committee recognises that NEXTDC is a capital-intensive business that requires significant investment for infrastructure to be built prior to generating income from customer contracts. With NEXTDC operating in a high-growth industry, the Company needs to continue to expand its infrastructure investment to keep pace with customer demand. It is on this basis that the Board and Committee places emphasis on revenue and underlying EBITDA generation as well as delivery of projects and maintaining strong operational performance when incentivising Senior Executives.

The composition of performance metrics comprising the FY24 STI program are as follows:

FIGURE 4: FY24 STI PERFORMANCE METRICS

# FINANCIAL YEAR 2024 STI PLAN

The purpose of the STI Plan is to provide an incentive for Senior Executives to achieve against the Company's strategic objectives by delivering or exceeding on annual business plan requirements to ensure sustainable superior returns for shareholders. Key terms of the FY24 STI Plan are detailed below.

# 3.6 Variable remuneration – Long Term Incentive (LTI) Plan

# FINANCIAL YEAR 2024 LTI PLAN

The aim of the LTI Plan is to provide an incentive for Senior Executives to help achieve the Company's strategic objectives and to deliver performance that is sustainable and aligned with shareholder interests. It also acts as a retention mechanism to maintain a stable team of high performing executives. The current LTI Plan is the NEXTDC Limited Equity Incentive Plan (EIP).

The Committee recognises that continual review is required to ensure the program remains in step with the Company's rapid growth, and in line with trends, both of ASX market peers and international competitors. The below table reflects the changes to the LTI Program approved by Shareholders at the 2023 AGM. Shareholders may recall that the Board had determined that, in order to retain key executives and properly align their interests with those of shareholders, the equity award would be split into two equal tranches, of Performance Rights and Restricted Rights (together, Rights), which would vest over a period of three to five years.

The Board considers that relative TSR continues to be the most appropriate measure of alignment between executives' interests and shareholder value, and therefore half of the award remains subject to the same relative TSR conditions over the three and four year tranches (the Performance Rights). In order to ensure the retention of key executives, the vesting period for the other half of the awards has been determined to be three, four and five years, each with an equal tranche, and subject to the Senior Executive remaining employed by the Company, underpinned by a positive absolute TSR condition and behavioural assessment (the Restricted Rights).

# Feature

# Description

# Opportunity/ Allocation

Maximum LTI value was set at  $150\%$  of Base Salary Packages.

The LTI grant of Rights is calculated by applying the following formula:

Number of Performance Rights = Base Package x Maximum LTI% ÷ Right Value

NB: The Right Value is the volume weighted average share price of Shares over the 10 trading days following the release of the Company's FY23 results. The "Maximum LTI %" recognises that the stretch level of Rights will be granted when stretch performance is achieved.

# Feature

# Description

<table><tr><td>Measurement period</td><td colspan="2">The measurement period for the LTI award will now be extended to include tranches which vest after the 3rd, 4th and 5th years.For FY24, the LTI award comprises 50% Performance Rights and 50% Restricted Rights, allocated as follows:Performance RightsTranche 1 (50% of the Performance Rights), which will be tested after three years and be eligible to vest at that time; andTranche 2 (50% of the Performance Rights), which will be tested after four years and be eligible to vest at that time. Restricted RightsTranche 1 (33.3% of the Restricted Rights), which will be tested after three years and be eligible to vest at that time;Tranche 2 (33.3% of the Restricted Rights), which will be tested after four years and be eligible to vest at that time; andTranche 3 (33.4% of the Restricted Rights), which will be tested after five years and be eligible to vest at that time.In all cases performance is measured over a period commencing from the end of the day of the release of the Company&#x27;s full year results (for this award it is the release of the FY23 results) to the end of the day of the release of its results for the relevant year (in this case, it is FY26, FY27 and FY28). No component will be subject to re-testing.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="7">Performance conditions</td><td colspan="2">Performance RightsVesting of each tranche of the Performance Rights award is subject to two performance conditions:1. Gateway HurdleVesting of the Performance Rights is subject to an initial gateway hurdle of NEXTDC achieving positive total shareholder return (TSR) over the relevant measurement period for that tranche. If this gateway hurdle is not met, the Performance Rights under the EIP automatically lapse even if the TSR Hurdle (described below) is achieved.2. TSR HurdleIn addition to the Gateway Hurdle, vesting under the EIP is subject to a relative TSR performance condition. The TSR Hurdle is determined by ranking NEXTDC&#x27;s TSR over the measurement period for the relevant tranche, relative to the TSR of companies in the ASX 100 Accumulation Index (Index). Vesting of the Performance Rights under the EIP will be determined by reference to the following vesting schedule:</td></tr><tr><td>NEXTDC&#x27;s TSR over the Measurement Period</td><td>Percentage of Rights that vest</td></tr><tr><td>Less than TSR of Index</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>At TSR of Index</td><td>25%</td></tr><tr><td>Between TSR of Index and TSR of Index + 5%</td><td>Pro rata vesting from 25% to 100% on a straight-line basis</td></tr><tr><td>TSR of Index + 5% or greater</td><td>100%</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">The scale requires that the Company deliver a TSR to shareholders that is at least as good as the overall market (as indicated by the TSR of the Index over the measurement period) before any vesting may occur.Full vesting does not become available until the TSR of the Company reaches the TSR of the Index over the measurement period plus 5% p.a. This would, in the view of the Board, represent an outstanding outcome for shareholders. Restricted RightsVesting of each tranche of the Restricted Rights award is subject to the following conditions:1. ServiceVesting of restricted Rights is subject to the Senior Executive remaining employed with NEXTDC at the end of the Measurement Period of each relevant tranche.2. Underpinning conditionsVesting of the Restricted Rights is also subject to the following underpinning conditions:Positive TSR for the Measurement Period; andBehavioural assessment based on Board discretion, ensuring the Senior Executive has not acted in breach of the Company&#x27;s code of conduct.</td></tr></table>

Feature  
Description  

<table><tr><td>Reason for selection</td><td>TSR was selected as it recognises the total returns (share price movement and dividends assuming they are reinvested into Company shares) that accrue to shareholders over the Measurement Period. This measure creates the most direct alignment between shareholder return and rewards realised by Senior Executives. The measurement period for assessing TSR performance is aligned with the release of results to ensure that the share price upon which TSR is determined at the start and end of the measurement period reflects an informed market. Market adjusted TSR was selected to ensure that participants do not receive windfall gains from broad market movements unrelated to the performance of the Senior Executives. The positive TSR gate ensures that Senior Executives cannot benefit from the LTI Plan when shareholders have lost value over the Measurement Period. Vesting commences upon NEXTDC&#x27;s TSR matching the Index TSR, with full vesting occurring once NEXTDC&#x27;s TSR exceeds the Index TSR by 5% compound annual growth over the measurement period. This hurdle has been determined with regard for the historic performance of the ASX 100 Accumulation Index whereby 5% compound annual growth or greater represents upper quartile performance. This would, in the Board&#x27;s view, represent an outstanding outcome for the Company.</td></tr><tr><td>Exercise of vested Rights</td><td>Upon vesting the Board will determine the extent to which their value will be delivered in Shares and/or cash. The Board will also determine whether Shares will be issued or acquired for participants via the Employee Share Trust (EST) and if the EST is used, whether new issues or on-market purchases of Shares will be undertaken by the trustee of the EST. No amount is payable by participants to exercise vested Rights.</td></tr><tr><td>Forfeiture and termination</td><td>In the event of cessation of employment due to dismissal for cause, all unvested Rights are forfeited. In the event of cessation of employment due to resignation, all unvested Rights are forfeited unless otherwise determined by the Board. In the event of cessation of employment due to death, total and permanent disability or redundancy, unvested Rights will continue on-foot and be subject to the original terms as though employment had not ceased, unless the Board determines otherwise. In any other circumstances the Board has discretion to determine how the unvested Rights will be treated upon cessation of employment with the Company.</td></tr><tr><td>Board discretion</td><td>The Board retains discretion to modify vesting outcomes. Rights that do not vest will lapse. Board discretion to vary vesting will generally only be applied when the vesting that would otherwise apply is considered by the Board to be inappropriate, and when it would not align with shareholder returns.</td></tr><tr><td>Change of Control</td><td>In circumstances where there is a likely change in the control of NEXTDC, the Board has discretion to determine the level of vesting (if any) having regard to the portion of the measurement period elapsed, performance to date against performance conditions and any other factors it considers appropriate. If an actual change in the control of the Company occurs before the Board can exercise this discretion, unless the Board determines otherwise, unvested Rights will vest and become exercisable in proportion to the Company&#x27;s performance against the TSR Hurdle up to the date of the change of control.</td></tr><tr><td>Malus/Claw back Provisions</td><td>The Board retains the ability to reduce or apply malus/clawback to awards where the participant has acted fraudulently or dishonestly or is in material breach of their obligations to the Company; or where the Company becomes aware of material misstatements or omissions in the financial statements of the Company; or any circumstances occur that the Board determines to have resulted in an unfair benefit to the recipient.</td></tr><tr><td>Hedging</td><td>The Company prohibits the hedging of Rights and Restricted Shares by Participants.</td></tr></table>

# 3.7 Risk Management and Clawback Provisions

A sound risk management culture is important to NEXTDC. The Company's STI and LTI Plans have been designed to protect the Company from the risk of unintended or unjustified pay outcomes by allowing risk factors to be taken into account over long periods and by way of a variety of measures that are considered key to the Company's success. For example:

- Basing the STI on a number of performance measures, including initial gateway hurdles before any STI is able to be paid (subject also to malus/clawback provisions)  
- Deferring a component (50%) of STI to ensure alignment with shareholder value and compliance with NEXTDC's codes of conduct and corporate governance  
- Distributing remuneration components across both long and short-term performance-based mechanisms to encourage prudent risk taking in line with the overall objectives of the Company.

While formal shareholding requirements are not imposed for Senior Executives, the CEO has a material holding in NEXTDC, holding shares and vested performance rights valued at approximately 15 times base salary at 30 June 2024.

Board discretion is applied to the vesting of all STIs and LTIs to ensure any proposed awards are aligned with shareholder returns. As noted, the Board also retains the ability to reduce or clawback awards in the event of serious misconduct or a material misstatement in the Company's financial statements.

# 4. STI AND LTI PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES FOR FY24

# 4.1 STI Vesting Outcomes

The Senior Executives performance against the FY24 STI performance measures – as previously described in section 3.5 above are as follows. The Committee continues to be of the view that they were highly relevant to the Company's financial performance and to growing shareholder value. The individual components contributed to the overall composition of the STI award as follows:

FIGURE 7: CALCULATION OF STI OUTCOMES

Upon review of the above performance criteria set for the FY24 STI Program, the Committee has determined that  $85\%$  of the FY24 STI opportunity be awarded to the participants. The FY24 STI outcome was determined by the Committee and approved by the Board. This outcome strictly reflects the performance against the performance criteria set out for this year's program. There has been no further discretion applied to these outcomes.

The individual components of this assessment were as follows:

<table><tr><td>Type of performance measure and weighting at target</td><td>KMP Performance measure</td><td>FY24 performance</td><td>Level of Achievement (% of Stretch)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Financial 75%</td><td>Underlying EBITDA1 (40%): This percentage was awarded out of a maximum of 40% and was arrived at on the basis that the Company achieved underlying EBITDA1 of $204.3 million against the initial guidance range of $190 million (50%) to $200 million (100%) for this metric set by the Committee. See section 3.5 for more details on its method of calculation including the minimum EBITDA gateway also set for this metric.</td><td>$204.3 million</td><td>100%</td></tr><tr><td>Total Revenue (35%): This percentage was out of a maximum award of 35% and was arrived at on the basis that the Company achieved $404.3 million out of the initial guidance range of $400 million (50%) to $415 million (100%) for this metric set by the Committee. See section 3.5 for details on the method of calculation.</td><td>$404.3 million</td><td>64%</td></tr></table>

# 4.2 LTI Vesting Outcomes

The measurement period for the FY21 LTI was between 27 August 2020 and 28 August 2023. The vesting condition attached to the FY21 LTI was based on NEXTDC's TSR over the measurement period, against the relative performance of the S&P / ASX 200 Accumulation Index (AXJOA), with vesting percentages to be determined by the following scale, as outlined in the 30 June 2021 Annual Report:

<table><tr><td>NEXTDC&#x27;s TSR over the Measurement Period</td><td>Percentage of Rights that Vest</td></tr><tr><td>Less than TSR of Index</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>At TSR of Index</td><td>25%</td></tr><tr><td>Between TSR of Index and TSR of Index + 5%</td><td>Pro rata vesting from 25% to 100% on a straight-line basis</td></tr><tr><td>TSR of Index + 5% or greater</td><td>100%</td></tr></table>

NEXTDC's performance over the measurement period was  $12.4\%$ , compared to growth of  $31.2\%$  in the ASX 200 Accumulation Index. Given performance did not meet that of the Index, the Board determined that  $100\%$  of the LTI rights granted in FY21 would not be awarded to participants and would instead lapse in accordance with the terms of the plan.

The measurement period for the FY22 LTI is for approximately a three-year period, beginning from the end of trade on the day of release of the FY21 results, and ending upon the end of the day of release of the annual results for FY24. The vesting condition attached to the FY22 LTI is based on NEXTDC's TSR over the measurement period, against the relative performance of the S&P / ASX 100 Accumulation Index (Index).

Given vesting is not able to be determined until the end of day of release of the FY24 annual results, the Board will determine vesting following the release of the FY24 Annual Report.

# 5. EMPLOYMENT TERMS FOR DIRECTORS AND SENIOR EXECUTIVES

# 5.1 Non-Executive Directors

Once appointed all Non-Executive Directors enter into a service agreement with the Company in the form of a letter of appointment. The letter summarises the Board policies and terms, including compensation relevant to the office of the Director.

All current Non-Executive Directors carry an initial contract duration of three years (subject to election and re-election by shareholders). The employment contracts for the Non-Executive Directors do not carry notice period provisions, nor do they provide for any termination benefits.

All Directors must retire from office at the third annual general meeting after the Director was last elected and will then be eligible for re-election. Upon cessation of a Director's appointment, the Director will be paid his or her Director's fees on a pro-rata basis, to the extent that they are unpaid.

The Non-Executive Director Remuneration Policy applies to Non-Executive Directors of the Company in their capacity as Directors and as members of Committees, and may be summarised as follows:

Remuneration comprises:

Board fees  
Committeefees  
Superannuation  
- Other benefits  
Securities (if appropriate at the time).

- Remuneration is managed within the aggregate fee limit (AFL) or fee pool of $2,000,000 which was approved by shareholders at the FY23 AGM in November 2023.  
- The Non-Executive Director Remuneration Policy contains guidelines on when the Board should seek adjustment to the AFL such as in the case of the appointment of additional Non-Executive Directors.  
Remuneration should be reviewed annually.  
Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to termination benefits.  
The level of Board Fees (being the fees paid for membership of the Board, inclusive of superannuation and exclusive of Committee fees) will be set with reference to the median of comparable ASX listed companies.  
Committee fees may be used to recognise additional contributions to the work of the Board by members of Committees, but in a manner that, when combined with Board Fees, will not exceed the  $75^{\text{th}}$  percentile of comparable ASX listed companies.  
The Company does not currently provide securities as part of Non-Executive Director remuneration.

In accordance with the Non-Executive Director Remuneration Policy, during FY24 the Remuneration and Nomination Committee conducted an annual review of Non-Executive Director remuneration. The review was informed by an independent benchmarking exercise with reference to ASX-listed companies of a similar size as well as the Domestic Industry Peer Group. The benchmarking exercise compared NEXTDC to companies that are directly comparable in terms of market capitalisation, with ten larger and ten smaller than NEXTDC within the ASX 100 index only, as well as five larger and five smaller than NEXTDC within the Domestic Industry Peer Group. In conjunction with the benchmarking exercise, the review also considered other factors such as surrounding market conditions and sentiment, the trajectory of the Company's growth, strategic objectives, and the geographical spread of the Company.

As a result of the review, it was determined that there would be no increase in Non-Executive Director remuneration at this stage.

The rates of fees including superannuation contributions in respect of the 2024 financial year are as follows:

TABLE 3: NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FEE SCHEDULE  

<table><tr><td></td><td>FY24</td></tr><tr><td>Board Chair</td><td>$430,000 per annum</td></tr><tr><td>Non-Executive Director</td><td>$170,000 per annum</td></tr><tr><td>Audit and Risk Management Committee Chair</td><td>$40,000 per annum</td></tr><tr><td>Remuneration and Nomination Committee Chair</td><td>$40,000 per annum</td></tr><tr><td>Investment Committee Chair</td><td>$40,000 per annum</td></tr><tr><td>Committee Member</td><td>$17,000 per annum</td></tr></table>

# Recommended Non-Executive Director Shareholding

Non-Executive Directors are encouraged to accumulate shares on their own behalf, over a three-year period, of equivalent value to their average annual Directors' fees.

# 5.2 Senior Executives

Remuneration and other terms of employment for the Chief Executive Officer and other key management personnel are also formalised in service agreements.

The CEO's base salary package increased by  $15\%$  effective 1 July 2023, from  $1.32 million in FY23 to$ 1.52 million in FY24, inclusive of the Company's commitment to contribute a  $0.5\%$  increase in Super Guarantee Contribution (SGC). Since his appointment to the role in 2012, the CEO has overseen the Company's expansion. Over the last four years, NEXTDC has achieved:

Compound annual market capitalisation growth

NEXTDC is unique among ASX-listed companies due to its high capital-intensity and growth prospects requiring further capital to be invested ahead of demonstrable revenues and profits. Most comparable peers are US-based, as is the more comparable executive talent. The Board considered the Company's long-term strategy and potential and determined that the CEO's remuneration remains appropriate in context of the skills and experience necessary to lead NEXTDC.

Other major provisions of the agreements relating to service agreements are set out below.

Deferred rights under the Senior Executive STI Plan are granted following release of the annual results. The shares vest one year from the grant date. On vesting, each right automatically converts into one ordinary share. Senior Executives do not receive any dividends and are not entitled to vote in relation to the rights during the vesting period. If a Senior Executive ceases employment before the rights vest, they have six months from the cessation of employment or the vesting date, whichever is later, to exercise their deferred rights. Any rights not exercised in this period will automatically lapse.

The fair value of the rights is determined based on the volume weighted average trading price of the Company's shares over the 10 trading days following release of the Company's annual results.

The Non-Executive Directors of the Company did not receive any shares in NEXTDC on behalf of the Company in respect of the 2023 and 2024 financial reporting periods.

Loans to Directors and Executives

There were no loans to Directors or other key management personnel at any time during the year.

# 6.5 Remuneration Received (Non-statutory)

# Remuneration received in FY24

The amounts disclosed below as Senior Executive remuneration for FY24 reflect the actual benefits received by each Senior Executive during the reporting period. The remuneration values disclosed have been determined as follows:

# Fixed remuneration

Fixed remuneration includes base salaries received, paid leave, payments made to superannuation funds, and the taxable value of non-monetary benefits received, and excludes any accruals of annual or long service leave.

# Short-term incentives

Awarded STI represents bonuses that were awarded to each Senior Executive in relation to FY24 performance,  $50\%$  of which will be paid in FY25.  $50\%$  of the STI bonuses awarded are deferred for 12 months, with employees being able to elect whether the award will be delivered in cash or equity. Deferred STI represents the remaining  $50\%$  of the FY24 STI that is expected to vest in FY25.

# Long term incentives

The value of vested rights is determined based on the intrinsic value of the rights at the date of vesting, being the difference between the share price on that date, and the exercise price payable by the Senior Executive. The performance rights that were granted in FY21 did not meet the performance conditions in FY24, and as a result,  $100\%$  of the rights lapsed in accordance with the terms of the Plan.

TABLE 12: REMUNERATION RECEIVED IN FY24  

<table><tr><td>Name</td><td>Fixed Remuneration</td><td>Awarded STI (cash)</td><td>Deferred STI (cash or equity)</td><td>Vested LTI</td><td>Total Value</td></tr><tr><td>Craig Scroggie</td><td>1,528,900</td><td>644,583</td><td>644,583</td><td>-</td><td>2,818,066</td></tr><tr><td>Simon Cooper</td><td>583,822</td><td>245,883</td><td>245,883</td><td>-</td><td>1,075,588</td></tr><tr><td>Oskar Tomaszewski</td><td>581,560</td><td>245,883</td><td>245,883</td><td>-</td><td>1,073,326</td></tr><tr><td>David Dzienciol</td><td>581,560</td><td>245,883</td><td>245,883</td><td>-</td><td>1,073,326</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>3,275,842</td><td>1,382,232</td><td>1,382,232</td><td>-</td><td>6,040,306</td></tr></table>

The amounts disclosed above are not the same as the remuneration expensed in relation to each KMP in accordance with accounting standards. The Directors believe that the remuneration received is more relevant to users for the following reasons:

The statutory remuneration expensed is based on historic cost and does not reflect the value of the equity instruments when they are actually received by the Senior Executives  
The statutory remuneration shows benefits before they are actually received by the Senior Executives  
- Where rights do not vest because a market-based performance condition is not satisfied (e.g. TSR), the Company must still recognise the full amount of expenses even though the Senior Executives will never receive any benefits.  
- Share based payment awards are treated differently under the accounting standards depending on whether the performance conditions are market conditions (no reversal of expense) or non-market conditions (reversal of expense when shares fail to vest), even though the benefit received by the Senior Executives is the same (nil where equity instruments fail to vest).

The information in this section has been audited together with the rest of the remuneration report.

# Audit and non-audit services

Details of the amounts paid or payable to the auditor (PricewaterhouseCoopers Australia) for audit and non-audit services during the year are disclosed in Note 24 Remuneration of auditors.

The Company may decide to employ the auditor on assignments additional to their statutory audit duties where the auditor's expertise and experience with the Company and/or the group are important.

The board of directors, in accordance with advice provided by the Audit and Risk Management Committee, is satisfied that the provision of the non-audit services is compatible with the general standard of independence for auditors imposed by the Corporations Act 2001. The directors are satisfied that the provision of non-audit services by the auditor did not compromise the auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 for the following reasons:

- all non-audit services have been reviewed by the Audit and Risk Management Committee to ensure they do not impact the impartiality and objectivity of the auditor, and  
none of the services undermine the general principles relating to auditor independence as set out in APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants.

# Auditor's independence declaration

A copy of the auditor's independence declaration as required under section 307C of the Corporations Act 2001 is set out on page 58.

# Auditor

PricewaterhouseCoopers continues in office in accordance with section 327 of the Corporations Act 2001.

This report is made in accordance with a resolution of the Directors.

# Auditor's Independence Declaration

(a) no contraventions of the auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 in relation to the audit; and  
(b) no contraventions of any applicable code of professional conduct in relation to the audit.

This declaration is in respect of NEXTDC Limited and the entities it controlled during the period.

# 1 Basis of preparation

The 2024 financial statements notes have been grouped into the following sections:

Section 1 Business performance  
Section 2 Operating assets and liabilities  
Section 3 Capital and financial risk management  
Section 4 Items not recognised  
Section 5 Employee remuneration  
Section 6 Other

Each section sets out the accounting policies applied along with details of any key judgements and estimates made or information required to understand the note.

NEXTDC Limited (the Company) is domiciled in Australia. The registered office is 20 Wharf St, Brisbane QLD 4000.

The nature of the operations and principal activities of the Company and its controlled entities (referred to as 'the Group') are described in the Segment information.

The consolidated general purpose financial statements of the Group for the year ended 30 June 2024 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 27 August 2024.

The financial statements:

- Have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), Australian Accounting Standards and other authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) and International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board  
- Have been prepared on an historical cost basis, except for derivatives measured at fair value  
- Are presented in Australian dollars and, unless otherwise stated, all values have been rounded to the nearest thousand dollars (\(000) under the option available under the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors' Report) Instrument 2016/191  
- Present reclassified comparative information where required for consistency with the current year's presentation  
- Adopt all new and amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the AASB that are relevant to the operations of the Group and effective for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2023  
- Do not early adopt any other Accounting Standards and Interpretations that have been issued or amended but are not yet effective.

# (a) Principles of consolidation and equity accounting

# (i) Associates

Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control or joint control. This is generally the case where the Group holds between  $20\%$  and  $50\%$  of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting (see (ii) below), after initially being recognised at cost.

# (ii) Equity method

Under the equity method of accounting, the investments are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group's share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of the investee in profit or loss, and the Group's share of movements in other comprehensive income of the investee in other comprehensive income. Dividends received or receivable from associates and joint ventures are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment.

(continued)

# (a) Principles of consolidation and equity accounting (continued)

# (ii) Equity method (continued)

Where the Group's share of losses in an equity-accounted investment equals or exceeds its interest in the entity, including any other unsecured long-term receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the other entity.

Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in these entities. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of equity-accounted investees have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

The carrying amount of equity-accounted investments is tested for impairment in accordance with the policy described in note 27(g).

# Business performance

# 2 Segment performance

# (a) Description of segments

Management considers the business from a geographic perspective and has identified five reportable segments, being each geography where the Group operates data centre facilities and the last capturing financial information from operations that do not naturally fit into any particular geography. As these segments do not exist as a separate legal entity, information such as income tax expense and segment liabilities are not prepared and provided to management for review and therefore not presented.

During the year, management reassessed the basis for reporting on revenue from external customers to its chief operating decision makers, breaking down the revenue into a number of sub-categories to provide further meaningful information to decision makers on key revenue elements across each segment. Comparative information has also been amended to reflect this change.

# (c) Other segment information

# (i) Profit/(loss) before tax

Management assesses the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of EBITDA. Interest income and expenditure are not allocated to segments, as this type of activity is driven by the central treasury function, which manages the cash position of the Group.

A reconciliation of profit/(loss) before income tax is provided as follows:

# (ii) Segment liabilities

As noted above, the segment liabilities for each operating segment are not required by executive management for purposes of their decision making. As such, these are not provided to management and not categorised.

# (d) Segment reporting

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the executive management team. The executive management team is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments. The executive management team is the chief operating decision making body and consists of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Customer and Commercial Officer.

# 4 Revenue and other income (continued)

# (b) Revenue recognition

AASB 15 establishes principles for reporting the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity's contracts with customers and requires application of a five-step process to identify the contract with the customer, identify performance obligations in the contract, determine transaction price, allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations and recognise revenue when performance obligations are satisfied.

Revenue is recognised for the major business activities as follows:

# (i) Data centre revenue

Data centre revenue primarily consists of recurring monthly fees including:

1) colocation which includes the provision of racks  
2) interconnection services such as cross connects  
3) other revenue including management of power and power passthrough; and  
4) upfront project fees related to colocation and interconnection services.

Revenue from the provision of recurring monthly service fees is recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered. Project fees primarily comprise installation services relating to a customer's initial deployment. As this is not considered to be a distinct service, revenue is deferred and recognised over the term of the contract with the customer, taking into account renewal options that are held by the customer.

The Group applies the practical expedient in the revenue standard and does not disclose information about the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations on contracts that are unsatisfied, as the Group has the right to consideration from its customers in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Group's services to date. This is applied to all its data centre revenue, on the basis that the upfront project fees are not a significant portion of each contract.

The Group enters into contracts with customers that guarantee certain performance measures such as uptime and on time delivery of services. If these guarantees of service performance are not achieved, the Group reduces revenue for any credits or cash payments that may be due to customers under contract. Key areas of estimation include the amount of the service credits, the likelihood that the service credits will be claimed, and the time period over which they impact revenue.

Customer incentives provided by way of upfront discounts are contract assets that are amortised via a reduction in revenue over the expected contract life - refer to note 7(c).

# (ii) Rental revenue from landbank properties

Rental revenue from landbank properties relates to rental revenue received from short term tenants occupying properties purchased for future expansion activities.

# (iii) Interest income

Interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset, except for financial assets that subsequently become credit-impaired. For credit-impaired financial assets, the effective interest rate is applied to the net carrying amount of the financial asset (after deduction of the loss allowance).

# (i) Capitalised borrowing costs

During 2024, the Group identified an error relating to the capitalisation of borrowing costs during the construction of qualifying assets. Refer to note 27 (b) for further detail. The capitalisation rate used to determine the amount of borrowing costs to be capitalised is the weighted average interest rate applicable to the entity's general borrowing costs during the year, in this case  $6.07\%$  (2023:  $4.83\%$ )

Refer to note 15 for details on borrowings and note 11 for details on interest expense on lease liabilities for the year.

Comparative information has been restated to reflect the prior period error detailed in note 27 (b).

# (a) Trade receivables

# (i) Classification as trade receivables

Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. They are generally due for settlement within 30 - 60 days and therefore are all classified as current. Trade receivables are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional unless they contain significant financing components, when they are recognised at fair value. The Group holds the trade receivables with the objective to collect the contractual cash flows and therefore measures them subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

# (ii) Fair values of trade and other receivables

Due to the short-term nature of the trade and other receivables, their carrying amount is considered to be the same as their fair value.

# (iii) Impairment and risk exposure

Information about the Group's impairment policies, calculation of loss allowance and exposure to credit risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk can be found in note 14.

# (b) Interest receivable

Interest receivable relates to interest accrued on term deposits. Credit risk of this is assessed in the same manner as cash and cash equivalents which is detailed in note 14.

# (a) Capitalised transaction costs

Fees paid on establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan. To the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is deferred until draw down occurs, at which point it will be amortised over the remaining term of the facility. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates. Refer to note 15 for further details on the Group's loan facilities.

# (b) Security deposits

Included in the security deposits was  $9.8 million (2023:$ 9.2 million) relating to deposits held as security for bank guarantees.

# (c) Customer incentives

The customer incentive balance includes amounts where customers are offered incentives in the form of free or discounted periods. It also includes amounts paid to customers where guarantees of service performance are not achieved as set out in Note 4(b)(i). In these cases, the dollar value of the incentive or cash payment is recorded as an asset and amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract as described in Note 4(b)(i).

# (d) Contract costs

Eligible costs that are expected to be recovered are capitalised as a contract cost and amortised over the expected contract life.

# (i) Recognition and measurement

Trade and other payables, including accruals, are recorded when the Group is required to make future payments as a result of purchases of assets or services provided to the Group prior to the end of financial period. The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days of recognition. Trade and other payables are presented as current liabilities unless payment is not due within 12 months from the reporting date. They are recognised initially at their fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

# (ii) Fair values of trade and other payables

Due to the short-term nature of trade and other payables, their carrying amount is considered to be the same as their fair value.

# (iii) Risk Exposure

As the majority of payables are in Australian dollars, management does not believe there are any significant risks in relation to these financial liabilities. Refer to note 14 for details of the Group's financial risk management policies.

# 9 Property, plant and equipment (continued)

# (a) Property, plant and equipment

Land and buildings are shown at historical cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.

Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less depreciation. Costs capitalised include external direct costs of materials and services, employee costs and borrowing costs during development. After development is completed, subsequent borrowing costs and other holding charges are expensed as incurred.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of any component accounted for as a separate asset is derecognised when replaced. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income during the year in which they are incurred.

Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost, net of their residual values, over their estimated useful lives as follows:

# Category

Buildings

Plant and machinery

Computer equipment

Office furniture and equipment

Right-of-use assets

# Useful life

40 years

2-25 years

1-15 years

5-10 years

1-99 years

The assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting year, considering key assumptions including changes in technology, physical conditions and potential climate change implications.

An asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount. These are included in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

# RIGHTS AND LICENCES

Certain licences that NEXTDC possesses have an indefinite useful life and are carried at cost less impairment losses and are subject to impairment review at least annually and whenever there is an indication that it may be impaired.

Other licences that NEXTDC acquires are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life which is generally 25 years. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each annual reporting period.

# INTERNALLY GENERATED SOFTWARE

Internally developed software is capitalised at cost less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line basis over the asset's useful economic life which is generally four to seven years. Their useful lives and potential impairment are reviewed at the end of each financial year.

Costs incurred in configuring or customising SaaS arrangements can only be recognised as intangible assets if the implementation activities create an intangible asset that the entity controls and the intangible asset meets the recognition criteria. Those costs that do not result in intangible assets are expensed as incurred, unless they are paid to the suppliers of the SaaS arrangements to significantly customise the cloud-based software for the Group, in which case the costs are recorded as a prepayment for services and amortised over the expected renewable term of the arrangement.

# SOFTWARE UNDER DEVELOPMENT

Costs incurred in developing products or systems and costs incurred in acquiring software and licenses that will contribute to future period financial benefits through revenue generation and/or cost reduction are capitalised to software and systems. Costs capitalised include external direct costs of services and employee costs.

Assets in the course of construction include only those costs directly attributable to the development phase and are only recognised following completion of technical feasibility and where the Group has an intention and ability to use the asset.

# (a) Leases (continued)

(iii) The Group's leasing activities and how these are accounted for

The Group has a number of leases over property, motor vehicles, and connectivity links that have varying terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights.

Leases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the Group. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income over the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each year. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.

Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:

- fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable  
variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate  
amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantees  
the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and  
- payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising that option.

Lease payments to be made under reasonably certain extension options are also included in the measurement of the liability.

The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, which is generally the case for leases in the Group, the lessee's incremental borrowing rate is used.

To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the Group:

- where possible, uses recent third-party financing received by the individual lessee as a starting point, adjusted to reflect changes in financing conditions since third party financing was received  
- makes adjustments specific to the lease, eg. term, country, currency and security

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:

the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability  
- any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received  
- any initial direct costs, and  
- restoration costs.

Payments associated with short-term leases of equipment and vehicles and all leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT equipment and small items of office furniture.

# (iv) Extension and termination options

Extension and termination options are included in a number of property and equipment leases across the Group. These are used to maximise operational flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the Group's operations.

The majority of extension and termination options held are exercisable only by the Group and not by the respective lessor.

# Capital and financial risk management

# 12 Capital risk management

The Group's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns to its shareholders and benefits to its stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

In the future, the Directors may pursue funding options such as debt, sale and leaseback of assets, additional equity and various other funding mechanisms as appropriate in order to undertake its projects and deliver optimum shareholders' return.

The Group intends to maintain a gearing ratio appropriate for a company of its size and growth.

<table><tr><td></td><td>30 June</td><td>Restated#</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2024</td><td>2023</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>$’000</td><td>$’000</td></tr><tr><td>Total borrowings and lease liabilities</td><td>1,455,082</td><td>1,442,073</td></tr><tr><td>Less: derivative financial instruments</td><td>(12,972)</td><td>(33,757)</td></tr><tr><td>Less: cash and cash equivalents</td><td>(1,236,192)</td><td>(765,841)</td></tr><tr><td>Net debt</td><td>205,918</td><td>642,475</td></tr><tr><td>Total equity</td><td>3,567,100</td><td>2,329,678</td></tr><tr><td>Total capital</td><td>3,773,018</td><td>2,972,153</td></tr><tr><td>Gearing ratio</td><td>5.5%</td><td>22.0%</td></tr></table>

The change in the gearing ratio was primarily driven by the equity fundraising activities during the period. Refer to note 13 for movements in ordinary share capital.

The Group manages its capital structure by regularly reviewing its gearing ratio to ensure it maintains an appropriate level of gearing within facility covenants. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated as total interest bearing financial liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents. Total capital is calculated as equity, as shown in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, plus net debt.

# (c) Ordinary shares

In April 2024, the Group issued 60,829,464 ordinary shares to institutional investors at a price of $15.40. In May 2024, the Group issued an additional 24,969,277 ordinary shares to retail investors at a price of $15.40 per share as part of the same equity raising transaction.

Ordinary shares entitle the holder to participate in dividends and the proceeds on winding up of the Group in proportion to the number of and amounts paid on the shares held. On a show of hands every holder of ordinary shares present at a meeting in person or by proxy, is entitled to one vote, and upon a poll each share is entitled to one vote.

Ordinary shares have no par value and the Group does not have a limited amount of authorised capital.

# (d) Performance rights and deferred share rights

Performance rights and deferred share rights, which subject to satisfaction of a performance hurdle, give rise to an entitlement to the value of an ordinary share in NEXTDC Limited. The Board has discretion to determine if the value will be provided in shares, cash or a combination of shares and cash. As part of NEXTDC's Equity Incentive Plan, which is offered to employees to create alignment with the Group's strategic objectives, 61,162 ordinary shares were issued on 18 September 2023. These shares were issued following the vesting of deferred STI share rights.

# (e) Loan funded share plan

The Group operated a legacy Loan Funded Share Plan remuneration scheme which was designed to attract and retain key employees. The arrangement involved the issue of shares to NEXTDC Share Plan Pty Ltd, whose sole purpose was to hold shares as trustee for its beneficiaries (its participants). The participants were required to meet service requirements before being entitled to access these shares.

The fair value at grant date of the shares was determined using either a Black-Scholes or binomial option pricing model that took into account the exercise price, the term of the option, the impact of dilution, the share price at grant date and expected price volatility of the underlying share, the expected dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate for the term of the loan. The assessed fair value was recognised as share-based payments.

# 14 Financial risk management

The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group's overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group.

The Company's $2.9 billion Syndicated Debt Facilities comprise the following tranches:

- $800 million - Term Loan Facility (fully drawn)  
- $600 million - Capital Expenditure Facility ($400 million undrawn)  
- $800 million - Revolving Credit Facility (multi-currency) (undrawn)  
- $300 million - Term Loan Facility (fully drawn)  
- $100 million - Term Loan Facility (fully drawn)  
- $300 million - Revolving Credit Facility (undrawn)

The facilities have a maturity date of 3 December 2026, except for the $300 million Term Loan Facility, which has a maturity date of 3 December 2028.

NEXTDC is exposed to interest rate volatility due to the variable rate on its Syndicated Debt Facilities. To mitigate the interest rate risk associated with this floating element, NEXTDC has entered into a series of interest rate swaps under which $600 million drawn under the facilities have their base interest rate fixed until 3 December 2024, while the remaining $800 million drawn have their base rate fixed until 3 December 2025.

A derivative asset and associated cash flow hedge reserve has been taken up at 30 June 2024 to account for these transactions.

The Group's transactions are predominantly conducted in Australian dollars. Overall, management assesses the Group's exposure to financial risk as low. However, the Group does have a financial risk management program in place. The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments for speculative purposes.

The Group holds the following financial instruments:

The balance in the cashflow hedge reserve from hedging relationships where hedge accounting no longer applies was  $4.7 million in FY24 (FY23:$ nil).

# Hedge effectiveness

Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments, to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument.

The Group enters into interest rate swaps that have similar critical terms as the hedged item, such as reference rate, reset dates, payment dates, maturities and notional amount. As all critical terms matched during the year, there is an economic relationship.

# (b) Market risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk for the Group is comprised of foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Report

30 June 2024

(continued)

# 14 Financial risk management (continued)

# (b) Market risk (continued)

# (i) Foreign exchange risk

The Group does not currently have any significant operations outside Australia and its transactions are predominantly conducted in Australian dollars. Consequently, management has determined that the Group has little exposure to foreign exchange risk. On this basis, the Group does not have any active risk mitigation strategies in relation to foreign exchange risk.

# (ii) Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk

The Group's main interest rate risk arises from its various fixed-rate term deposits and its syndicated debt facility (refer to note 15(a)). The floating rate loan tranches expose the Group's borrowings to changes in interest rates. The embedded interest rates for the lease liabilities are fixed, consequently the interest rate risk in relation to these instruments is limited.

# Instruments used by the group

The Group has incorporated derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rates. Under its interest rate swaps, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between the contracted fixed and floating rate interest amounts determined on a notional principal amount. Within these interest rate swaps, there is embedded floor protection at  $0\%$ , which is consistent with the terms of the underlying senior debt facility.

The following table details the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts outstanding at the end of the reporting period:

# (c) Credit risk

Credit risk arises from counterparties holding cash and cash equivalents, security deposits, trade and other receivables, and derivatives.

# (i) Cash and cash equivalents and security deposits

Deposits are placed with Australian banks or independently rated parties with a minimum rating of 'A' class in both short term and long term. To reduce exposure deposits are placed with a variety of financial institutions.

The credit quality of financial assets can be assessed by reference to external credit ratings (if available) or to historical information about counterparty default rates:

# (ii) Trade and other receivables

Customer credit risk is managed subject to the Group's established policy, procedures and control relating to customer credit risk management. Credit evaluations are performed on all customers. Outstanding customer receivables are monitored regularly.

The Group aims to minimise concentration of credit risk by undertaking transactions with a large number of customers. Revenues from data centre services of  $182.4m were derived from two customers, contributing$ 99.1m (25%) and $83.3m (21%) respectively (2023: $87.4m (24%) and $81.4m (22%) respectively). Revenues from these two customers were derived across numerous orders at multiple data centre facilities with the underlying orders having a range of different expiry dates. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the intention that the Group's exposure to bad debts is minimised.

The maximum exposure to credit risk at the end of the reporting period is the carrying value of each class of the financial assets mentioned above and each class of receivable disclosed in Note 6. The Group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets.

(continued)

# 14 Financial risk management (continued)

# (c) Credit risk (continued)

# (ii) Trade and other receivables (continued)

The Group applies the simplified approach to providing for expected credit losses prescribed by AASB 9, which permits the use of the lifetime expected loss provision for all trade receivables.

To measure the expected credit loss, receivables have been grouped based on days overdue. The methodology applied in estimating expected credit losses below has been changed compared to that applied for the year ended 30 June 2023. The judgements and associated assumptions made in the prior periods were in the context of the impact of COVID-19. Calculations have been adjusted, reverting to pre-COVID-19 credit loss rates given the COVID-19 environment has now eased and we are not seeing any particular economic flow on effects that would warrant retaining the heightened rates.

The expected credit loss continues to take into account the higher interest rate environment, and reflects historical experience as well as other factors that are considered to be relevant, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the current circumstances, such as the economic impact of higher interest rates, the actions of governments, the responses of businesses and consumers across different industries, and the associated impact on the global economy. Accordingly, the Group's expected credit loss estimates are inherently uncertain, and as a result, actual results may differ from these estimates.

The loss allowance provision as at 30 June 2024 is determined as follows:  

<table><tr><td>30 June 2024</td><td>Current $&#x27;000</td><td>1 to 30 days past due $&#x27;000</td><td>31 to 60 days past due $&#x27;000</td><td>More than 60 days past due $&#x27;000</td><td>Total $&#x27;000</td></tr><tr><td>Expected loss rate</td><td>1%</td><td>5%</td><td>7.5%</td><td>25%</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Gross carrying amount</td><td>43,330</td><td>2,138</td><td>4,069</td><td>487</td><td>50,024</td></tr><tr><td>Loss allowance provision</td><td>433</td><td>107</td><td>305</td><td>122</td><td>967</td></tr><tr><td>Net receivables</td><td>42,897</td><td>2,031</td><td>3,764</td><td>365</td><td>49,057</td></tr><tr><td>30 June 2023</td><td>Current $&#x27;000</td><td>1 to 30 days past due $&#x27;000</td><td>31 to 60 days past due $&#x27;000</td><td>More than 60 days past due $&#x27;000</td><td>Total $&#x27;000</td></tr><tr><td>Expected loss rate</td><td>2%</td><td>10%</td><td>15%</td><td>50%</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Gross carrying amount</td><td>39,968</td><td>5,382</td><td>932</td><td>791</td><td>47,073</td></tr><tr><td>Loss allowance provision</td><td>799</td><td>538</td><td>140</td><td>396</td><td>1,873</td></tr><tr><td>Net receivables</td><td>39,169</td><td>4,844</td><td>792</td><td>395</td><td>45,200</td></tr></table>

# (iii) Derivatives

Credit risk for derivative financial instruments arises from the potential failure by counterparties to the derivative transaction contract to meet their obligations. The credit risk exposure to interest rate swaps is the fair value of these contracts. All derivative financial instruments are with our major international banking partners, all of which have an independently rated minimum credit rating of 'A' as of July 2024.

# (d) Borrowings

Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption amount is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan. To the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is deferred until the draw down occurs, at which point it will be amortised over the remaining term of the facility. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates.

# 20 Share-based payments

# (a) Performance rights

The performance rights plan was established by the Board of Directors to provide long-term incentives to the Group's Senior Executives based on total shareholder returns (TSR) taking into account the Group's financial and operational performance. Under the Plan, eligible participants may be granted performance rights on terms and conditions determined by the Board from time to time. Outstanding performance rights were granted during the course of FY22, FY23 and FY24. The vesting conditions for the FY22, FY23 and FY24 grants relate to TSR exceeding the ASX 100 Accumulation Index over the measurement period. Vesting of the FY22 rights will be tested on or around the day following the release of the annual results for the year ended 30 June 2024. The FY23 and FY24 rights include tranches which vest after the third and fourth years, and will be tested on or around the day following the release of each of the annual results for 2025, 2026 and 2027 respectively.

Performance rights are granted by the Company for nil consideration. The Board has discretion to determine if the value will be provided in shares, cash or a combination of shares and cash. Rights granted under the plan carry no dividend or voting rights.

The fair value of the FY24 performance rights at the date of valuation was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model that takes into account the exercise price, the term of the rights, the share price at grant date and expected price volatility of the underlying share, the expected dividend yield, the risk-free interest rate for the term of the rights and the correlations and volatilities of peers in the ASX 100 Accumulation Index.

# (b) Restricted Rights

The restricted rights plan was established by the Board of Directors to provide long term incentives to promote the retention of the Group's Senior Executives. The restricted rights are subject to the Senior Executive remaining employed by the Company, underpinned by a positive absolute TSR condition and behavioural assessment. Vesting of the restricted rights issued in FY24 will occur in equal tranches over three, four and five years, and will be tested on or around the day following the release of each of the annual results for 2026, 2027 and 2028 respectively.

Restricted rights are granted by the Company for nil consideration. The Board has discretion to determine if the value will be provided in shares, cash or a combination of shares and cash. Rights granted under the plan carry no dividend or voting rights.

The fair value of the FY24 restricted rights at the date of valuation was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model that takes into account the exercise price, the term of the rights, the share price at grant date and expected price volatility of the underlying share, the expected dividend yield, the risk-free interest rate for the term of the rights and the correlations and volatilities of peers in the ASX 100 Accumulation Index.

The model inputs for restricted rights granted during the year ended 30 June 2024 included:

a) grant date: 15 January 2024  
b) expiry date: 15 January 2032  
c) share price at grant date: $13.89  
d) expected price volatility of the company's shares:  $30\%$  
e) expected dividend yield:  $0\%$ , and  
f) risk-free interest rate:  $3.69\%$  (three year rights) and  $3.68\%$  (four year rights), and  $3.71\%$  (five year rights)

The expected price volatility is based on the historic share price volatility of NEXTDC Limited.

# (c) Deferred shares - executives short-term incentive scheme

Under the Group's short-term incentive (STI) scheme for FY23, executives received  $50\%$  of the annual STI achieved in cash, with  $50\%$  deferred for 12 months. Executives were able to elect whether the deferred component would be delivered in cash or equity. The FY23 tranche of deferred rights were granted in September 2023 and will vest on or around September 2024, being 12 months after the date on which they were granted. They automatically convert into one ordinary share each on vesting at an exercise price of nil. The executives do not receive any dividends and are not entitled to vote in relation to the deferred shares during the vesting period. If an executive ceases to be employed by the Group within this period, they will have 6 months from cessation of employment or the vesting date (whichever is later) to exercise the deferred share right. Any rights not exercised within this period will automatically lapse.

The number of rights to be granted was determined based on the currency value of the achieved STI divided by the volume weighted-average price at which the Company's shares were traded on the Australian Securities Exchange over the 10 days following the release of the Group's FY23 results, being $13.17.

# Income tax

The income tax expense or revenue for the period is the tax payable on the current period's taxable income based on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences and to unused tax losses.

The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period in Australia. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred income tax is also not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Current and deferred tax is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

Comparative information has been restated to reflect the prior period error detailed in note 27 (b).

Deferred tax assets may be a combination of unused tax losses, offsets and timing differences based on management's foreseeable forecasts, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses, offsets and timing differences can be utilised. Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies.

In FY20 the Group derecognised deferred tax assets in relation to carry-forward tax losses and temporary differences as it believed they no longer met the requirement to be recognised, stemming from the impact that the recent growth and expansion activity has had on taxable profits. Despite the derecognition, these carry-forward tax losses and offsets can be carried forward indefinitely and have no expiry date.

On 22 November 2021, NEXTDC Limited acquired a  $19.99\%$  interest in an ASX listed entity, Sovereign Cloud Holdings (ASX: SOV), via an upfront placement of  $12.4 million. Following the placement, NEXTDC acquired a further$ 4.5 million in shares via a follow-on pro rata entitlement offer to maintain its  $19.99\%$  shareholding. Transaction costs of $1.1 million incurred as part of the acquisition have been capitalised against the investment.

Following acquisition, NEXTDC Limited was entitled to one seat on the board of Sovereign Cloud Holdings and now participates in all significant financial and operating decisions.

On 29 June 2023, NEXTDC Limited acquired a further $4.0m in shares via a pro-rata non-renounceable entitlement offer, increasing its shareholding to 33.61%. With the increased ownership and continued board seat, the Group maintains that it has significant influence over this entity.

During the year to 30 June 2024, NEXTDC made a further $12.5 million investment into Sovereign Cloud Holdings via participation in an accelerated renounceable entitlement offer, bringing its shareholding to 31.96% at 30 June 2024.

# (i) Tax consolidation legislation

NEXTDC Limited and its wholly-owned Australian controlled entities have implemented the tax consolidation legislation.

The head entity, NEXTDC Limited, and the controlled entities in the tax consolidated Group account for their own current and deferred tax amounts. These tax amounts are measured as if each entity in the tax consolidated Group continues to be a stand-alone taxpayer in its own right.

In addition to its own current and deferred tax amounts, NEXTDC Limited also recognises the current tax liabilities (or assets) and the deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses and unused tax credits assumed from controlled entities in the tax consolidated Group.

The entities have also entered into a tax funding agreement under which the wholly-owned entities fully compensate NEXTDC Limited for any current tax payable assumed and are compensated by NEXTDC Limited for any current tax receivable and deferred tax assets relating to unused tax losses or unused tax credits that are transferred to NEXTDC Limited under the tax consolidation legislation. The funding amounts are determined by reference to the amounts recognised in the wholly-owned entities' consolidated financial statements.

The amounts receivable/payable under the tax funding agreement are due upon receipt of the funding advice from the head entity, which is issued as soon as practicable after the end of each financial year. The head entity may also require payment of interim funding amounts to assist with its obligations to pay tax instalments.

Assets or liabilities arising under tax funding agreements with the tax consolidated entities are recognised as current amounts receivable from or payable to other entities in the Group.

Any difference between the amounts assumed and amounts receivable or payable under the tax funding agreement are recognised as a contribution to (or distribution from) wholly-owned tax consolidated entities.

# (ii) Investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint venture entities

Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost in the consolidated financial statements of NEXTDC Limited.

# (v) Correction of error in accounting for prior years

During 2024, the Group identified an error relating to the capitalisation of borrowing costs during the construction of qualifying assets (which are assets constructed over a substantial period of time). The error resulted in an understatement of depreciation expense, overstatement of interest expense and a corresponding understatement of property, plant and equipment. The errors arose in the FY23 comparative period and earlier, and have been adjusted for in the opening balance of FY23.

The error has been corrected by restating each of the affected financial statement line items for the prior year as follows:

# (c) Critical accounting estimates

Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that may have a financial impact on the entity and that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

This note provides an overview of the areas that involved a higher degree of judgement or complexity, and of items which are more likely to be materially adjusted due to estimates and assumptions turning out to be wrong.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Report

30 June 2024

(continued)

# 27 Summary of material accounting policies (continued)

# (c) Critical accounting estimates (continued)

# (i) Deferred taxation

Deferred tax assets may be a combination of unused tax losses, offsets and timing differences based on management's foreseeable forecasts, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses, offsets and timing differences can be utilised. Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies.

The Group previously derecognised deferred tax assets in relation to carry-forward tax losses and temporary differences as it believed they no longer met the requirement to be recognised, stemming from the impact that the recent growth and expansion activity has had on taxable profits. Despite the derecognition, these carry-forward tax losses and offsets can be carried forward indefinitely and have no expiry date.

# (ii) Income taxes

The Group is subject to income taxes in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes. There are certain transactions and calculations undertaken during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Group estimates its tax liabilities based on the Group's understanding of the tax law. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made.

# (iii) Leases

The Group is required to determine the measurement of lease liabilities based on the present value of remaining lease payments, discounted using the Group's incremental borrowing rate at commencement date. Judgement is required in determining an appropriate incremental borrowing rate, and the Group has determined the rate based on the effective interest rate of its most recent borrowings, adjusted to the specific term of each lease. In determining the lease term, management considered all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to either exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension options are only included in the lease term if it is reasonably certain to be extended. The assessment is reviewed if a significant event or significant change in circumstances occurs which affects this assessment, and that is within the control of the lessee.

# (iv) Revenue from contracts with customers

Key judgements in the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers include the identification of performance obligations within the contracts, allocation of the transaction price within the contract to the identified performance obligations, treatment of the upfront project fees and treatment of any variable consideration subsequent to initial commencement. Refer to Note 4 for further details.

# (v) Impairment

Assessment of indicators of impairment and the determination of CGUs for impairment purposes require significant management judgment. Indicators of impairment may include changes in the Group's operating and economic assumptions or possible impacts from emerging risks such as climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy. Considering the location and nature of our assets as well as our continued focus on operational resilience and business continuity programs, at this stage, we do not consider the potential impacts of climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy to be an impairment indicator.

# 27 Summary of material accounting policies (continued)

# (c) Critical accounting estimates (continued)

# (vi) Capitalised borrowing costs

The Group is required to capitalise borrowing costs on qualifying assets that take a substantial period of time to complete. Key judgements in this process include determining what constitutes a qualifying asset and the timing of commencement and cessation of capitalisation. The Group defines a substantial period of time as greater than 12 months. The capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when expenditures for the asset are being incurred, borrowing costs are being incurred, and activities necessary to prepare the asset for its intended use or sale are in progress. Capitalisation ceases when substantially all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying asset for its intended use or sale are complete.

# (d) Employee Share Trust

The Group has formed two entities to administer the Group's employee share schemes. The trusts are consolidated, as the substance of the relationships are that the trusts are controlled by the Group. Shares held by NEXTDC Share Plan Pty Ltd and NEXTDC Employee Share Plan Trust are disclosed as treasury shares and deducted from contributed equity.

# (e) Share-based payments reserve

The share-based payments reserve is used to recognise:

- the grant date fair value of long-term incentives issued to participants  
- the grant date fair value of shares issued to participants  
the issue of shares held by NEXTDC Share Plan Pty Ltd and NEXTDC Employee Share Plan Trust

# (f) Functional and presentation currency

These consolidated financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, which is the Group's functional currency.

# (g) Impairment of assets

Intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired. Other assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets (cash-generating units). Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at the end of each reporting period.

Consideration has been given to the potential financial impacts of climate change related risks on the carrying value of the Group's assets through a qualitative review of the Group's climate change risks and mitigating actions. This review did not identify any material financial reporting impacts.

# (h) Cash and cash equivalents

For the purpose of presentation in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, deposits held at call with financial institutions and term deposits with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

30 June 2024

# 27 Summary of material accounting policies (continued)

# (i) Investments and other financial assets

# (i) Classification

The Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:

those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through OCI or through profit or loss), and  
those to be measured at amortised cost.

The classification depends on the entity's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows.

For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in profit or loss or OCI. For investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading, this will depend on whether the Group has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).

The Group reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes.

# (ii) Measurement

At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVPL are expensed in profit or loss.

# Debt instruments

Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group's business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories into which the Group classifies its debt instruments:

- Amortised cost: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in profit or loss and presented in other gains/(losses) together with foreign exchange gains and losses. Impairment losses are presented as separate line item in the consolidated income statement.  
- FVOCI: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets' cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at FVOCI. Movements in the carrying amount are taken through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest income and foreign exchange gains and losses which are recognised in profit or loss. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and recognised in other gains/(losses). Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in other gains/(losses) and impairment expenses are presented as separate line item in the consolidated income statement.  
- FVPL: Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at FVPL. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at FVPL is recognised in profit or loss and presented net within other gains/(losses) in the year in which it arises.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Report

30 June 2024

(continued)

# 27 Summary of material accounting policies (continued)

# (i) Investments and other financial assets (continued)

# (ii) Measurement (continued)

# Equity instruments

The Group subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value. Where the Group's management has elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity investments in OCI, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to profit or loss following the derecognition of the investment. Dividends from such investments continue to be recognised in profit or loss as other income when the Group's right to receive payments is established.

Changes in the fair value of financial assets at FVPL are recognised in other gains/(losses) in the consolidated income statement as applicable. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) on equity investments measured at FVOCI are not reported separately from other changes in fair value.

# (iii) Impairment

The group assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments carried at amortised cost and FVOCI. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. For trade receivables, the group applies the simplified approach permitted by AASB 9, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables, see note 14 for further details.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Report

30 June 2024

(continued)

# 27 Summary of material accounting policies (continued)

# (j) Derivatives and hedging activities

# (i) Classification of derivatives

Derivatives are only used for economic hedging purposes and not as speculative investments. However, where derivatives do not meet the hedge accounting criteria, they are classified as 'held for trading' for accounting purposes and are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss. They are presented as current assets or liabilities to the extent they are expected to be settled within 12 months after the end of the reporting period.

The Group designates derivatives as hedges of a particular risk associated with the cash flows of recognised assets and liabilities and highly probably forecast transactions (cash flow hedge). At inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the economic relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items including whether changes in the cash flows of the hedging instruments are expected to offset changes in the cash flows of hedged items. The Group documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking its hedge transactions.

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve within equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss, within other gains/(losses).

The Group designates interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of highly probable forecast interest. The interest rate swaps have floor options embedded within; in this case the Group designates only the intrinsic value of the options as the hedging instrument.

Gains or losses relating to the effective portion of the change in intrinsic value of the options are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve within equity. The changes in the fair value of the aligned time value of the option are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the cost of hedging reserve. If the hedged item is transaction-related, the time value is reclassified to profit or loss when the hedged item affects profit or loss.

If the hedged item is time period related, then the amount accumulated in the cost of hedging reserve is reclassified to profit or loss on a rational basis. Those reclassified amounts are recognised in profit or loss in the same line as the hedged item. If the hedged item is a non-financial item, then the amount accumulated in the cost of hedging reserve is removed directly from equity and included in the initial carrying amount of the recognised non-financial item. Furthermore, if the Group expects that some or all of the loss accumulated in cost of hedging reserve will not be recovered in the future, that amount is immediately reclassified to profit or loss.

# (ii) Fair Value measurement

The fair value of the interest rate swaps which the group has entered into are not traded in an active market (for example, over-the-counter derivatives), and are determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. Given all significant inputs required to fair value these interest rate swaps are observable, the instrument is classified as level 2.

# (k) Provisions

Provisions for asset replacement and make good obligations are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.

Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Report

30 June 2024

(continued)

# 27 Summary of material accounting policies (continued)

# (k) Provisions (continued)

Provisions are measured at the present value of management's best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting year. The discount rate used to determine the present value is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as interest expense.

# (I) Employee benefits

# (i) Short-term Obligations

Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits and annual leave expected to be settled within 12 months after the end of each reporting period in which the employees render the related service are recognised in respect of employees' services up to the end of the reporting period and are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. The liability for annual leave is recognised in payables.

# (ii) Other long-term employee benefit Obligations

The liability for long service leave and annual leave which is not expected to be settled within 12 months after the end of the reporting period in which the employees render the related service is recognised in the provision for employee benefits and measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the end of the reporting period. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service. Expected future payments are discounted using market yields at the end of the reporting period on national government bonds with terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows.

# (iii) Share-based Payments

Share-based compensation benefits are provided to participants via the Long Term Incentive Plan.

The fair value of performance rights is recognised as an employee benefits expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value granted, which includes any market performance conditions and the impact of any non-vesting conditions but excludes the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions.

Non-market vesting conditions are included in the assumptions. The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of each period, the Group revises its estimates of the number of rights that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.

# (m) Rounding of amounts

The Company is of a kind referred to in ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191, relating to the 'rounding off' of amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Amounts in the consolidated financial statements have been rounded off in accordance with that Class Order to the nearest thousand dollars, or in certain cases, to the nearest dollar.

# (n) Goods and Services Tax (GST)

Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of associated GST, unless the GST incurred is not recoverable from the taxation authority. In this case it is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense.

Receivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST receivable or payable. The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included with other receivables or payables in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Cash flows are presented on a gross basis. The GST components of cash flows arising from investing or financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to the taxation authority, are presented as operating cash flows.

# (o) Parent entity financial information

The financial information for the parent entity, NEXTDC Limited, disclosed in note 26 has been prepared on the same basis as the consolidated consolidated financial statements.

# (p) Assets in the course of construction

Assets in the course of construction are shown at historical cost. Historical cost includes directly attributable expenditure, including the capitalisation of interest costs, on data centre facilities which at reporting date, have not yet been finalised and/or ready for use. Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated.

Assets in the course of construction are transferred to property, plant and equipment upon successful testing and commissioning.

# (q) Revenue received in advance

Revenue received in advance primarily relates to the advance consideration received from customers in relation to project fees and service credits, for which revenue is recognised over time. Refer to Note 4 (b) for details in relation to the revenue recognition policy for project fees and service credits.

# (r) Borrowing costs

General and specific borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised during the period of time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use or sale. Qualifying assets are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale. Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation. Other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.

# Our audit approach

An audit is designed to provide reasonable assurance about whether the financial report is free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial report.

We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial report as a whole, taking into account the geographic and management structure of the Group, its accounting processes and controls and the industry in which it operates.

# Audit scope

- Our audit focused on where the Group made subjective judgements; for example, significant accounting estimates involving assumptions and inherently uncertain future events.  
- NEXTDC Limited has data centres operating in capital cities as well as regional locations across Australia and is expanding internationally.

# Key audit matters

- Amongst other relevant topics, we communicated the following key audit matters to the Audit and Risk Management Committee:  
Data centre revenue recognition  
Property, plant and equipment  
These are further described in the Key audit matters section of our report.

# Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial report for the current period. The key audit matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Further, any commentary on the outcomes of a particular audit procedure is made in that context.

# Key audit matter

# How our audit addressed the key audit matter

# Data centre revenue recognition

(Refer to note 4 – Data centre revenue of $400.7m)

The Group applies AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (AASB 15) to account for the services it provides to its customers. Accounting for revenue recognition was a key audit matter due to the:

Significance of revenue to understanding the financial results for users of the financial report  
- complexity involved in applying the requirements of AASB 15 given the number of revenue components and contracts with customers with bespoke terms and conditions, including in relation to recurring service fees, upfront project fees and service credits  
- judgements required by the Group in applying the

We performed the following procedures, amongst others:

Assessed whether the Group's accounting policies were in accordance with the requirements of AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (AASB 15)  
- Evaluated the judgements made by the Group in applying the accounting policy by obtaining an understanding of the revenue components and considering the terms and conditions of a sample of contracts  
For a sample of contracts for each revenue component tested, we:

# Key audit matter

# How our audit addressed the key audit matter

# requirements of AASB 15, such as:

identifying the performance obligations under its contracts with customers  
- determining the transaction price, considering the terms in the contracts relating to recurring service fees, upfront project fees, and service credits, and  
- the method of allocating the transaction price in the contract to the performance obligations.

developed an understanding of the key terms of the arrangement including parties, term dates, performance obligations, fees and payment terms  
- considered the Group's identification of performance obligations and allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations  
- recalculated the amount of revenue which the Group has recognised, taking into account the terms of the contracts for recurring service fees, upfront project fees, and service credits

Evaluated the reasonableness of the disclosures made in light of the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.

# Property, plant and equipment

(Refer to note 9 - Property, plant and equipment $3,781.5m)

NEXTDC has continued to invest in new data centres during the period, and to expand its existing data centre infrastructure. These growth projects require significant capital outlay which results in the capitalisation of external and internal costs into Property, Plant and Equipment.

During the current year, \(979.3\mathrm{m}\) has been capitalised as additions to assets in the course of construction, and \)596.6\mathrm{m}\) has been transferred from assets in the course of construction to the appropriate class of Property, Plant and Equipment.

Costs should be capitalised and depreciated in line with Australian Accounting Standards which outline the criteria required to be met for costs to be capitalised, and the treatment to be applied in the depreciation of the costs capitalised.

# This was a key audit matter because of the:

- significance of the additions balance to the Consolidated Balance Sheet  
- potential significance of the additions balance to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income should the costs not meet the criteria

Our audit approach included testing a sample of individually large value additions and transfers, while the residual balance was tested on a sample basis. We performed the following procedures, amongst others:

Developed an understanding of and evaluated the Group's cost capitalisation policy  
Assessed the processes implemented by the Group for the measurement of capitalised costs  
Sample tested capitalised costs to related documentation, including assessing whether they meet the criteria for capitalisation with reference to Australian Accounting Standards  
Assessed the appropriateness of capitalisation of internal costs, in particular salaries and wages  
Evaluated the appropriateness of which assets met the definition of a qualifying asset per AASB 123 Borrowing Costs  
Assessed the appropriateness of the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation and the resulting amount that was capitalised to the cost of the qualifying assets  
- For a sample of assets, assessed the appropriateness of the timing and method of transfers from assets in the course of construction to the appropriate property, plant and equipment

# required for capitalisation

- judgement involved in assessing whether internal costs meet the criteria for capitalisation  
- judgement involved in assessing which assets meet the definition of a qualifying asset and the borrowing costs that are eligible for capitalisation  
- significance of the depreciation expense to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and  
- the judgements applied in determining the appropriate timing of transfers from assets in the course of construction to the appropriate class of Property Plant and Equipment, and the calculation of the depreciation expense.

asset class, and recalculated the amount of depreciation that the Group had recognised

Evaluated the reasonableness of the disclosures made in light of the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.

# Other information

The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report for the year ended 30 June 2024, but does not include the financial report and our auditor's report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and accordingly we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon through our opinion on the financial report. We have issued a separate opinion on the remuneration report.

In connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of the directors for the financial report

The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001, including giving a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

# Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial report

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial report.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial report is located at the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board website at: https://www.auasb.gov.au/admin/file/content102/c3/ar1_2020.pdf. This description forms part of our auditor's report.
