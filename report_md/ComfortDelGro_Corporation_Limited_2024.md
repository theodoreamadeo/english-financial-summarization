# CHAIRMAN AND MANAGING DIRECTOR'S STATEMENT

Dear Shareholders,

2024 was a year of exciting developments for ComfortDelGro as we navigated a dynamic global economic and social landscape. The Group witnessed a steady recovery in key markets with reduced volatility in energy prices and declining interest rates, but we also faced rising geopolitical uncertainty, increasing regulatory requirements for our industry and ongoing challenges such as the global driver shortage.

# Building Scale, Pursuing Profitable Growth

We continued to make good progress in executing our strategy—strengthening our core businesses, expanding into new overseas markets and adjacencies, and investing in building new capabilities.

# Public Transport - Bus & Rail

We are pleased to report the growth of our Public Transport business in international

markets. In Australia, we were awarded three bus franchises in Victoria, valued at A\$1.6 billion over a 10-year term. Commencing in July 2025 with new services across the west and northwest regions, this represents a 30 percent growth in our Victoria public bus business.

In the United Kingdom (UK), our subsidiary Metroline is the third-largest bus operator in London and has now expanded beyond the capital. Metroline won and has started operating four public bus franchises worth £422 million in Greater Manchester, increasing its overall portfolio by 30 percent. In Singapore, our subsidiary SBS Transit successfully retained the Seletar bus package of 29 routes under a five-year contract valued at an estimated $526 million.

Our international rail operations across Singapore, New Zealand, France and Sweden have grown four-fold from a network of 83km in 2021 to 343km in operation and under mobilisation to date.

# Our accomplishments in the Public Transport sector highlight our capacity for organic growth both at home and abroad.

Connecting Stockholm, our joint venture with the Go-Ahead Group, was awarded an 11-year contract to operate and maintain the Stockholm Metro from late 2025. This will be our largest rail operation outside Singapore, comprising all of Stockholm Metro's seven lines, including 100 stations, six depots, and  $107\mathrm{km}$  of track.

At home, Singapore One Rail, the joint venture between SBS Transit and RATP Dev, was awarded the contract to operate the Jurong Region Line (JRL), which will open for passenger service in 2027. The JRL will bring SBS Transit's rail network in Singapore from 83km to 107km, in addition to the existing Downtown and North East Line. This marks our second partnership with RATP Dev, following the ORA consortium with Alstom to operate Line 15 South of the Greater Paris Metro Network.

Our accomplishments in the Public Transport sector highlight our capacity for organic growth both at home and abroad. They reflect our strong operational capabilities, acknowledged by numerous leading transport regulators and industry partners, as well as our profound understanding of local markets.

# Point-to-Point Mobility and Adjacent Businesses

The Group focused on building scale and differentiation in the competitive point-to-point business in 2024. Through a focused acquisition strategy in Australia and the UK, we expanded our premium point-to-point offerings, targeting the attractive business-to-business segment.

In Australia, we significantly expanded our market presence with the acquisition of A2B Australia in April. We are now the country's largest taxi network operator with over 8,300 vehicles, including the premium Silver Service taxi brand.

In the UK, we extended the Group's footprint by acquiring Addison Lee, London's leading provider of premium private hire, courier, and black taxi services. Beyond enhancing our presence in the UK, this will also allow the Group to leverage Addison Lee's deep expertise to scale and strengthen our premium point-to-point offerings globally.

The Group also acquired UK-based CMAC, a leading asset-light ground transport and accommodation network specialist. CMAC offers transport solutions to businesses, managing over three million journeys a year, and is complementary to our operations in the region.

In Singapore, we continue to operate the largest taxi fleet and have expanded our premium segment offerings by adding new Toyota Alphard taxis to our existing limousine fleet. This move aligns with the growing demand for premium transportation services in the country.

Having built significant scale of over 43,000 taxis and private hire vehicles (PHVs) in our network in Singapore, Australia, China, and the UK, we are now committed to identifying and extracting synergies to optimise and grow this business segment.

# Capitalising on Megatrends and Building Capabilities

Our energy transition journey has been underpinned by the demand of our customers, partners and regulators to utilise inclusive, smart and green public transport modes to address the challenges of climate change and urbanisation. We are actively leveraging emerging technologies and strategic partnerships to push boundaries and transform traditional transportation models.

This includes investing in the exploration of future technologies, such as the commercialisation of Autonomous Vehicles (AV). We believe that the adoption of AV technology will help alleviate the global driver shortage and meet the transport demand of underserved areas in the long term. On this front, we are collaborating with Pony.ai, a leading autonomous driving technology company, to develop and operationalise large-scale robotaxi operations first in China and subsequently in our other key markets. We have embarked on a robotaxi pilot in Nansha, Guangzhou, to gain and build our operational capabilities for future expansion.

In advancing the sustainable commercial mobility ecosystem, progress has been made in our Electric Vehicles as a Service (EVaaS) venture. Strategic partnerships have been secured

with commercial EV distributors and trade associations to offer electrification solutions such as charging, leasing, and fleet management for commercial fleets in Singapore. This initiative combines expertise from internal capabilities across different businesses.

We continue to make headway in developing charging infrastructure. Since its inception in 2021, our joint venture, ComfortDelGro ENGIE, has rapidly expanded to establish the region's largest cross-border roaming network, installing one new charger every day. Through strategic

in Singapore, as well as accretive contributions from the newly acquired A2B Australia and Addison Lee.

With our strong home base and sound balance sheet, we have made a concerted effort to strengthen and pursue profitable overseas growth, reflected in the increase in overseas revenue share to 49.1 percent in 2024 from 42.6 percent in 2023.

Given the Group's strong operational results in 2024, the Board has proposed a final dividend

# We have a strong balance sheet, and the Group will continue to make a concerted effort to strengthen and pursue profitable overseas growth.

partnerships with ChargeEV and Gentari, the network now boasts over 2,600 charge points across Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand. In China, where EVs are widely adopted due to a strong push from the government, our joint venture with the Guangzhou Public Transport Group, Guangzhou ComfortDelGro Guangjiao New Energy Company, has 240 fast chargers that serve over 800 EVs daily.

By building a strong international network, ComfortDelGro positions itself as a trusted partner to industry leaders, regulators, and governments. This network helps us anticipate future trends that will shape the future of urban mobility.

# Creating Shareholder Value

The steadfast pursuit of our growth strategy, coupled with strong operational management, has translated into robust financial performance for ComfortDelGro in 2024 and seven consecutive quarters of growth. For the financial year ended 31 December 2024, the Group posted a strong performance, with Group revenue of S\(4.48 billion in 2024 compared to S\)3.88 billion in 2023, an increase of 15.4 percent. Profit After Tax and Minority Interest (PATMI) climbed by 16.6 percent to S\)210.5 million in 2024, compared to S$180.5 million in 2023.

The better earnings in the Public Transport and Taxi & Private Hire business segments were driven by the renewal of bus contracts at improved margins in the UK, higher fares and ride-hailing commission rates for taxis and PHVs

of 4.25 cents per share, subject to shareholders' approval at the Annual General Meeting on 25 April 2025. Together with the interim dividend of 3.52 cents per share paid on 14 August 2024, the total dividend for 2024 would be 7.77 Singapore cents per share. This represents a dividend payout ratio of 80 percent of PATMI in 2024, which is in line with the Group's updated dividend policy of paying out at least 70 percent of PATMI.

# Driving ESG Excellence

As a global mobility player, we recognise that our responsibilities extend beyond financial performance to the broader well-being of our planet and the communities we serve. We actively embed Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) practices across the organisation and into our business strategies.

We have made great strides in our energy transition journey with 60 percent of our owned global fleet being cleaner energy vehicles. Looking ahead, we remain dedicated to minimising our environmental impact and aim to have a 100 percent cleaner energy car and bus fleet by 2050.

Our business is made possible by our people. We view investments in employee development programmes and engagement initiatives as key to the success of our business and in supporting their career aspirations. By prioritising mutual understanding and collaborative engagement, we uphold the principles of tripartism and maintain constructive partnerships with trade unions and their designated representatives,

fostering an inclusive workplace culture where every individual feels valued and empowered.

During the year, we also launched our Community Investment framework, outlining a Group-wide approach to corporate social responsibility. We prioritise initiatives that uplift education, foster community inclusivity, enhance accessibility, and instill a spirit of giving among our people.

In 2024, we donated over S\(1.1 million in cash and over S\)100,000 in kind, while contributing over 20,000 volunteering hours. Our support extended to charities, philanthropic and nonprofit organisations, community interest and voluntary groups, co-operatives, and social enterprises. We also increased our social impact spending, including S\)3.4 million in Australia on services contracts with accredited First Nations suppliers, a four-fold increase from the previous year.

Our sustainability efforts have received global and local recognition. TIME magazine named us the only Southeast Asian transport company in its World's Most Sustainable Companies List 2024. We are also among the 350 companies in the Financial Times x Statista Asia-Pacific Climate Leaders List 2024 and one of six Singapore companies on the Dow Jones Best-in-Class Indices. We were once again recognised by Morningstar Sustainability as one of the ESG Top-Rated Companies in 2025, marking our second year of inclusion in the list. This year, we are the only transportation company in Asia Pacific to be included in the "Region Top Rated" list. In Singapore, we won the Corporate Governance Award (Diversity) at the SIAS Investors' Choice Awards 2024 and the Apex Corporate Sustainability Award.

# Public Transport (Rail)

The Group's subsidiary, SBS Transit Ltd, continued to strengthen its position as a key operator in Singapore's rail network, managing 31.3 percent of the national system, encompassing the North East Line (NEL), Downtown Line (DTL), and Sengkang-Punggol Light Rail Transit (SPLRT) systems.

The company expanded its footprint with the opening of Teck Lee Station on the Punggol LRT loop, Punggol Coast Station on the NEL and Hume Station on the DTL, bringing the total number of stations to 81.

Rail demand increased by 3.9 percent to 444.8 million passengers in 2024 compared to the previous year. Average daily ridership increased by 3.3 percent on the NEL, 5 percent on the DTL, and by 1 percent on the SPLRT.

In November, SBS Transit in a joint venture with French operator RATP Dev, secured a nine-year contract, with a two-year extension option, to operate the 24km, 24-station Jurong Region Line. With this win and the DTL 2 and 3 extensions, our rail network will increase by 30.2km to 114.8km or 37.4 percent of Singapore's total rail network.

![](images/df31c6791af4653e1dcbbe43de657223e135e3e48706efe33fc05c8dc0225010.jpg)

The Downtown Line continued to set the benchmark for the industry by maintaining its record as one of the world's most reliable MRT lines for the fourth year running. In 2024, it achieved 8.13 million train-km in Mean Kilometre Between Failure.

![](images/8a1d3d80c50b9b6c93d1c392ac9cf73ef4222b9e5f448558931e0af17b727146.jpg)

The DTL continued to set the benchmark for the industry by maintaining its record as one of the world's most reliable MRT lines for the fourth year running. In 2024, it achieved 8.13 million train-km in Mean Kilometre Between Failure (MKBF), which is the internationally used measure for railway reliability. The NEL significantly improved its reliability, nearly doubling its MKBF from 2.06 million to 4.10 million train-km. Additionally, the SPLRT clocked 549,000 train-km.

In March 2025, the company deployed the world's first Rail Rover on the DTL, a multifunction track trolley utilising ultrasonic and laser technology for comprehensive rail infrastructure monitoring, including defect detection, track geometry measurement, structural health monitoring, and water seepage detection.

Building on successful trials, the company introduced an enhanced robotic inspector on wheels, equipped with a camera and an articulated arm to conduct train inspections with greater accuracy. This innovation significantly improved the technicians' efficiency in inspecting the train's underframe.

In 2024, SBS Transit significantly improved workplace safety, reducing its injury rate by 34.4 percent to 118.80 accidents per 100,000 employees. This commitment to safety earned the company top honours at the Workplace Safety and Health Awards and the Land Transport Authority's Public Transport Safety and Security Awards.

To further enhance rail safety and security, the artificial intelligence (AI)-powered VAnGuard was deployed at all SPLRT stations to detect track

intrusions, unattended bags, and wheelchair users needing assistance. Additionally, AVANTE, a portable AI device monitoring track conditions and equipment, and driver attentiveness, is being trialled on the NEL and DTL.

More details of our rail operations can be found in SBS Transit's 2024 Annual Report.

# Public Transport (Bus)

SBS Transit maintained its market leadership in 2024, operating over 3,300 buses and commanding 54.3 percent of Singapore's public bus market. With operations spanning 14 bus terminals and 16 interchanges, the company averaged over 29,000 daily bus trips in 2024.

The successful extension of all six negotiated bus contracts under the Bus Contracting Model (BCM), where the Government retains fare revenue and owns assets while operators are contracted and paid to operate public bus services through a tendering process, secured long-term revenue streams and reduced operational risk. Notably, in July 2024, the Company won the Seletar Bus Package for a second consecutive term, its fourth successful tender win under the BCM.

SBS Transit's fleet transition accelerated in 2024, with its number of cleaner energy buses increasing to 110, including 85 electric and 25 diesel-hybrid models. Additionally, about 89 percent of its bus fleet meets Euro 5 or higher emission standards, reducing the company's environmental impact. To support its expanding electric bus fleet, more than 120 technicians were certified in electric vehicle safety through the Workforce Skills Qualification National Electric Vehicle Specialist Safety course in 2024.

In 2024, SBS Transit continued to invest in technology for safety, efficiency, and security. During the year, the company completed the fleetwide deployment of the Stratio condition monitoring system, which uses AI and machine learning to track over 200 parameters for

![](images/ca592f6efdf8938d1acb9c5a84e265a0c136ad5c9cc130801a09023a61d0535e.jpg)

predictive maintenance, leading to reduced vehicle downtime.

Other key initiatives include Golden Eye, a fatigue monitoring system, that was deployed on nearly 20 percent of the fleet, and will be installed on 1,000 buses by mid-2025. SBS Transit also piloted Mobile Autonomous Robotic Surveillance, an AI-powered robotic dog for depot surveillance, at Seletar Bus Depot. Initial trial results were promising, with plans for broader deployment across other bus depots.

The successful trial of AGIL DriveSafe+, an AI-based collision warning system, has resulted in plans to extend its implementation with an upgraded version to 60 buses in 2025. To improve safety, the company also installed digital side mirrors on 100 buses, leading to increased visibility and a reduction in blind spots.

Building on successful implementations in 2023, SBS Transit expanded CCTV video analytics and license plate recognition systems to Ulu Pandan and Hougang Bus Depots in 2024. These systems, designed to detect potential security threats, such as unauthorised vehicles or intrusions, earned the company the Public Transport Safety and Security Awards (Star Award) 2024.

More details of our public bus operations can be found in SBS Transit's 2024 Annual Report.

SBS Transit's fleet transition accelerated in 2024, with its number of cleaner energy buses increasing to 110, including 85 electric and 25 diesel-hybrid models.

Significant progress was made in expanding ComfortDelGro Taxi's fleet of electric and hybrid vehicles during the year, aligning with Singapore's national goals for carbon reduction and sustainable urban mobility.

# Taxi & Private Hire

ComfortDelGro Taxi remained Singapore's largest taxi operator, commanding a 64 percent market share with a combined fleet of over 8,400 Comfort and CityCab taxis.

Significant progress was made in expanding ComfortDelGro Taxi's fleet of electric and hybrid vehicles during the year, aligning with Singapore's national goals for carbon reduction and sustainable urban mobility. As of the end of 2024, close to 90 percent of the fleet are cleaner energy vehicles, including more than 200 electric taxis and over 7,300 hybrid taxis.

Since the launch of its ride-hailing service in 2021, the company has onboarded over 22,000 drivers on the CDG Zig platform.

The ride-hailing market continued to experience heightened competition in 2024, with new entrants challenging existing players. In response, in April 2024, ComfortDelGro Taxi and ride-hailing operator Gojek collaborated to implement a cross-dispatch model, allowing rides unfulfilled by one platform to be seamlessly redirected to the other, ensuring greater ride availability by leveraging the combined resources of both fleets.

![](images/7d099be0158581b22ced263c24faf0acbfd6883037e01a2b66e121368f604dfd.jpg)

CDG Zig undertook a significant backend revamp of its booking systems, introducing real-time vehicle tracking and optimised job-matching between passengers and drivers. The migration to a cloud-based microservices architecture has enhanced scalability and reduced time-to-market for new features to meet growing ride-hailing customer demands effectively.

CDG Zig has also modernised its ride-hailing platform with a front-end redesign and new features. The company has integrated real-time fleet location and routing optimisation solutions, enhancing the predictability and efficiency of service delivery. These advancements aimed at boosting driver earnings, reduced passenger wait times, and ensured a seamless, efficient ride-hailing experience.

Driver retention and recruitment remained key priorities. ComfortDelGro Taxi continued to offer its drivers competitive earnings, enhanced by attractive fares and the market's lowest commission rate on app and metered fares. In addition to fuel discounts and rental-free

days, the company also maintained its annual investment of S\\(5.5 million in driver benefits and welfare.

In December 2024, ComfortDelGro Taxi took steps to expand its business-to-business segment by tapping into the growing demand for premium transportation.

In January 2025, the company expanded its premium transportation offerings by introducing 40 new Toyota Alphard Hybrid taxis with limousine-style service. The first significant partnership with Lexus Borneo Motors is scheduled to commence in early 2025 and is expected to generate a significant increase in premium bookings for its limousine taxi hirers.

# Inspection & Testing Services

The Group's subsidiary, VICOM Ltd, continued to experience strong demand and steady growth in 2024, with 525,108 vehicles passing through its inspection lanes, maintaining its leading position in the vehicle inspection sector with a market share of 72.9 percent.

The installation of new ERP 2.0 On-Board Units (OBUs) progressed through 2024, with 77,000 vehicles equipped by the end of the year. The company's Vehicle Emission Testing Laboratory also saw increased activity, driven by new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedures standards and increased COE quotas.

VICOM's subsidiary, Setsco Services Pte Ltd (SETSCO), faced a challenging first half but a better second half that was bolstered by new government contracts and a recovery in the electronics, semiconductor and chemical sectors. SETSCO secured significant new projects, such as food testing contracts from the Singapore Food Agency, and a wastewater testing project from the National Environmental Agency.

SETSCO also benefitted from increased construction activities, securing major projects wins, including contracts for the Housing & Development Board, the MRT Cross Island Line Phase 2, and Changi Airport.

# OPERATIONS REVIEW

The growing need for non-emergency transportation, along with the expansion of eldercare and dialysis centres in Singapore, contributed to strong demand for ComfortDelGro MedCare's transportation services.

SETSCO also benefitted from increased construction activities, securing major projects wins, including contracts for the Housing & Development Board, the MRT Cross Island Line Phase 2, and Changi Airport. The company expanded its services in 2024 to include inspection for Electric Vehicle Charging systems and further expanded its certification offerings and business, bringing on new clients both in Singapore and overseas.

SETSCO's cybersecurity arm, Setsco-AN Security, became the first Southeast Asian lab to achieve the Network Security Assurance Scheme for telecommunication devices in 2024.

SETSCO also introduced soil and rock electrical resistivity testing, further broadening its service offerings. In response to growing concerns about Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS), commonly known as "forever chemicals" due to their persistence in the environment, SETSCO developed and launched a new testing service aimed at detecting PFAS contamination in the environment and food chains, addressing their potential negative effects on human health.

Investments in staff training and advanced equipment during the year, like the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer, have positioned SETSCO for further growth in pharmaceuticals and healthcare.

More details can be found in VICOM's 2024 Annual Report.

# Other Private Transport

# ComfortDelGro Bus

ComfortDelGro Bus continued to be the largest private bus operator in Singapore, with more than 200 vehicles, including 54 electric buses.

The company provides essential shuttle services for institutions and locations such as the National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University, Sentosa, Bukom refinery, and major hospitals. During the year, ComfortDelGro Bus supported several high-profile events, including the Rotary International Convention in May and the National Day Parade in August.

ComfortDelGro Bus made its first foray into airport operations in March 2024, securing a contract with Dnata to provide airside transfers and staff transport services.

In November 2024, ComfortDelGro Bus further strengthened its position in the school transport sector when it stepped in at short notice to take over the bus transport operations for the Canadian International School. The seamless transition ensured uninterrupted service after the previous operator faced operational and financial challenges.

The company implemented predictive maintenance measures, enabling early detection of potential issues. This approach has extended the lifespan of its buses and reduced unexpected breakdowns.

ComfortDelGro Bus received several honours in 2024, including the PCS Safety Excellence award and the Singapore Road Safety Award 2024. Additionally, three of its Bus Captains were recognised with Safe Driver Awards.

# ComfortDelGro MedCare

ComfortDelGro MedCare provides nonemergency transportation services for individuals with mobility issues, including wheelchair users, persons with disabilities and seniors. Since its inception, the company has expanded its fleet size, driver numbers and medical escort team to serve approximately 1,000 patients daily across Singapore, connecting them to a network of active ageing centres, daycares, rehabilitation facilities, and dialysis centres.

The growing need for non-emergency transportation, along with the expansion of eldercare and dialysis centres in Singapore, contributed to strong demand for ComfortDelGro MedCare's transportation services.

# ComfortDelGro Rent-A-Car

The Group's rental and leasing subsidiary ComfortDelGro Rent-A-Car operates a fleet of 1,760 vehicles.

In 2024, the corporate rental market witnessed a notable shift. Many companies revised their transportation policies, moving away from company-provided vehicles to offering

transport allowances to their employees. This shift resulted in an increased demand for individual vehicle rentals. To capitalise on this trend, ComfortDelGro Rent-A-Car intensified its focus on the business-to-business segment. The company actively pursued companies with sizable foreign hires and participated in government tenders and projects.

Despite challenging market conditions with persistently high COE premiums, the company successfully secured more than 100 new contracts across various industries, including partnerships with prominent multinational corporations, small and medium enterprises, and multiple government agencies.

In the private hire vehicle segment, the company successfully onboarded its drivers onto the new ZigRent app allowing the driver-hirers to transition from weekly rentals to daily GIRO payments.

points, as significant electrical infrastructure upgrades are often required. CDG ENGIE addressed this issue by implementing smart power management systems that enable real-time load balancing. These systems utilise unused electrical capacity during periods of low building load to charge EVs. By efficiently managing energy demand, these smart solutions facilitate the installation of additional charging points without the need for costly and disruptive infrastructure upgrades.

The company expanded its charging programme in March 2024, partnering with BYD, the world's largest electric vehicle manufacturer. This agreement allowed BYD car owners to access lower charging rates, building on a similar partnership established with Hyundai in the previous year.

In June 2024, the company won the inaugural tender from EV-Electric Charging, a subsidiary of LTA, to deploy fast chargers at 10 HDB commercial malls, marking the firm's third consecutive win in public tenders. With that, it will expand coverage to 552 locations in Singapore, establishing the largest public accessible EV charging network in the country.

In November 2024, CDG ENGIE launched a new mobile app, which allowed users to plan long road trips by calculating charging stops based on the state-of-charge and vehicle type. The new app retained the convenient pay-per-charge model, eliminating the need for prepaid values.

![](images/b9e6ae0c93b3def9dafa7b55db637b12cf0cf196530ea0e52ece077e7e584fac.jpg)

# Public Transport (Rail)

Auckland One Rail (AOR), our 50:50 partnership with Australia's UGL Rail Services, operates New Zealand's largest metro system. The network encompasses 41 stations, four stabling yards, and train crew facilities.

From 2025, AOR will also operate a fleet maintenance depot. Its scope of work under the Auckland Transport Franchise Agreement is gradually expanding to include rolling stock maintenance by October 2025. The Auckland Transport has bought 23 additional electric multiple units, which will be handed over with the existing fleet of 72 trains between December 2024 and October 2025. This additional fleet will support a significant increase in frequency with the opening of the City Rail Link (CRL) – New Zealand's largest transport infrastructure project

to date. CRL will expand the AOR network with twin 3.45 km rail tunnels reaching depths of up to 42 metres, two new underground stations, and provision for longer nine-car electric trains.

In March 2024, the Auckland Regional Operations Centre was opened, bringing together operational teams from AOR, KiwiRail (the Network Control Authority responsible for the maintenance of infrastructure) and Auckland Transport in the same facility. This co-location has fostered closer communication and strengthened inter-organisational relationships.

Despite ongoing partial network closures due to upgrading works, ridership demonstrated robust growth, increasing by 15 percent at the end of December 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.

# In September 2024, CDC Victoria clinched three bus franchises worth around A$1.6 billion through the Metropolitan Zero Emission Bus Franchises tender in Melbourne.

The year also saw challenges related to industrial action during the negotiation of a new collective agreement, which impacted punctuality and reliability. However, successful negotiations resulted in improved conditions, including the removal of previous workload restrictions.

AOR has placed a strong emphasis on customer experience and safety. The company piloted drone technology during special events to detect graffiti on the network and launched police and community engagement programmes to combat anti-social behaviour, starting with the Western Line and expanding to the Southern and Eastern Lines.

To enhance customer service, team leaders were equipped with digital devices to facilitate faster tracking of train movements on the network and provide prompt responses to users. Employees could also provide network disruption information to security contractors via digital means.

During the year, AOR worked towards achieving a more inclusive transport system, launching the Sunflower programme for customer facing staff to identify and help customers with invisible disabilities. The company also stepped up its Customer First Leaders training programme for staff.

# Public Transport (Bus)

ComfortDelGro Corporation Australia Pty Ltd (CDC), a subsidiary of the Group since October 2005, is one of the largest bus operators in Australia with operations across Victoria, New South Wales, the Northern Territory, Queensland, and the Australian Capital Territory.

# Victoria

In September 2024, CDC Victoria clinched three bus franchises worth around A$1.6 billion through the Metropolitan Zero Emission Bus Franchises tender in Melbourne. The new 10-year contracts are slated to commence in July

2025 and consist of 250 public bus and school routes serviced by over 360 buses.

The charter business in Victoria remained robust with strong booking levels throughout 2024. During the year, its pricing strategy was reviewed and adjusted to reflect the updated costs and service levels provided. Rail replacement services continued, though at reduced volumes compared to 2023, reflecting a slowdown in state projects during the year.

# New South Wales

In New South Wales, the company continued to focus on operational stability across existing contracts. The company successfully navigated ongoing operational challenges, including driver shortages, an ageing fleet, and increased road congestion. The reduction in abatements, including several months with zero assessments, demonstrated steady improvement in key operating regions across the state.

In July 2024, Red Bus CDC NSW, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CDC NSW, commenced operations on the NSW Central Coast under an eight-year contract that was awarded by the New South Wales Government. This contract encompasses bus services in Entrance, Gosford, Wyong, and the surrounding region. This followed the acquisition of Red Bus Services from the Shore family, who had operated on the Central Coast for more than eight decades.

The charter business in NSW has continued to grow and diversify, with existing private school contracts and new charter opportunities. In addition to competitive tendering in the Sydney market, the business also expanded into the Central Coast in late 2024.

In Regional NSW, the company began trials to operate three zero-emission buses (ZEB) in Queanbeyan and one ZEB in Narrabri under existing contracts. These ZEBs commenced service in October 2024 on an 18-month term.

# OPERATIONS REVIEW

In Regional NSW, the company began trials to operate zero-emission buses in Queanbeyan and Narrabri.

CDC NSW continued to enhance its capabilities in 2024 by maximising resource utilisation to successfully deliver rail and metro replacement services as well as special event services. It gave the company a strong competitive advantage as many NSW bus operators faced significant challenges in meeting service demands amidst ongoing driver shortages.

In 2024, CDC NSW implemented a number of industry leading initiatives through innovative partnerships and new programmes. Notably, the company collaborated with a range of stakeholders, including community groups, police, youth clubs, and social workers, to address anti-social behaviour and promote a culture of respect on buses. CDC NSW also developed an in-house Safe & Sound Training Programme to equip drivers with critical conflict management skills. These proactive measures were recognised at two prestigious awards: the Safety Award at the 2024 Bus NSW Member Conference, and the National Safety Award at the Bus Industry Confederation's National Industry Awards.

# Northern Territory

In 2024, CDC Northern Territory secured two key contracts. The first, was a five-year agreement, commencing in January, to provide the first dedicated school bus services in Tennant Creek, approximately 1,000 km south of Darwin. Following Australian Transit Group's (ATG) withdrawal from the Darwin market in October, CDC also secured an ongoing private contract and a five-month government contract previously operated by ATG.

# Queensland

CDC Queensland saw growth in the employee transport segment, particularly from blue-chip clients in the energy and engineering sectors. This included the successful tendering of a contract to transport employees in Central Queensland for CS Energy. Between September and November 2024, CDC Queensland helped transport 6,200 Singapore servicemen during an army exercise held in Rockhampton.

At the national level, CDC maintained active engagement with key industry associations, including the Bus Industry Confederation and the Australian Public Transport Industrial Association, where Mr Tony Hopkins, Chief Executive Officer of the CDC Regional Australia Division, serves as Chairman. CDC also maintained representation on committees within the Queensland Bus Industry Confederation through two staff members, and Board representation within Bus NSW through Mr David Mead, Chief Executive Officer of CDC NSW.

# Taxi & Private Hire

The Taxi business was impacted by economic conditions in 2024, with high inflation and lower consumer spending affecting market demand for personal transport services.

In April 2024, CDC acquired A2B Australia (A2B) for A$182 million, a move that significantly enhanced its position in the Australian market.

The acquisition was driven by the Group's strategy to scale its point-to-point mobility offerings and transform CDC Australia into a multi-modal mobility player in the country.

A2B, renowned for its 13cabs and Silver Service premium taxi brands, along with its key assets such as the MTI dispatch platform and Cabcharge payment system, brought new capabilities to the Group. One of the major outcomes of the acquisition was the integration of Swan Taxis, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ComfortDelGro, into A2B. This merger created the largest taxi network in Australia, with over 8,300 vehicles operating across all states and territories.

The acquisition also allowed CDC to expand into the premium service sector, leveraging A2B's established presence and strong brand recognition through its Silver Service offering. This allowed CDC to diversify its taxi services and cater to a higher-value customer segment. This strategic move positions CDC to capture a greater share of the market and capitalise on the growing demand for premium transportation services.

The integration will result in significant cost savings and commercial synergies, primarily through the sharing of resources and the streamlined deployment of technology across the newly unified network. The shutdown of Australia's 3G network in October 2024 necessitated the replacement of Swan Taxis' legacy payment system with a revamped Integrated Vehicle Technology system. This new system, combined with A2B's MTI booking and dispatch platform, replaced Swan Taxis' previous fleet dispatch and payment systems.

# Other Private Transport

National Patient Transport Pty Ltd (NPT) offers non-emergency healthcare transport services to major metropolitan hospital networks in New South Wales, Victoria, and Western Australia.

NPT successfully retained its service contracts across all regions in 2024. This was despite various challenges that affected the industry during the year, including labour shortages, wage rate increases, government budget constraints on annual rate indexes, as well as ambulance vehicle manufacturing and delivery delays.

The company focused on the recruitment and training of new patient transport officers and ambulance attendants to fill vacancies and address manpower shortage. In addition, the company proactively engaged with government and health services whilst collaborating closely with suppliers to source vehicle and equipment replacements.

In Victoria, NPT secured a 15-month contract extension with Ambulance Victoria, which included two additional six-month options. In the state, the company maintained contracts with six major and 16 regional government hospitals, Ambulance Victoria and several privately owned hospitals. The Victorian operations also included event work for the Australian Football League and training via its registered training organisation, NPT HEART.

During the year, NPT continued to provide critical healthcare transportation services, fulfilling contracts with the Department of Health in Western Australia for inter-hospital and community patient transport, and with HealthShare NSW for stretcher services.

Operational enhancements, including depot upgrades, helped to improve crew and vehicle management. The new Campbellfield facility in Victoria will support the delivery of high acuity transport services to Northeast Metro customers. In Western Australia, new depots in Canning Vale and Balcatta with their additional capacity allow for more efficient vehicle positioning for jobs north of Perth.

It sets the overall strategic direction for the Group and oversees the proper conduct of the business, performance and affairs of the Group. Board members are expected to be aware of their legal responsibilities, act in good faith, and exercise independent judgement in the best interests of the Company which includes having to exercise due care and diligence to avoid any conflicts of interest.

In appointing Directors, the Company seeks individuals who have integrity, expertise, business acumen, shareholder orientation and a genuine interest in the Group. Our Directors are also collaborative and proactive and this enables effective communication among themselves and Management.

# PRINCIPLE 1: THE BOARD'S CONDUCT OF AFFAIRS

# THE BOARD'S ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES

At the helm of the decision-making process of the Company is the Board. The Company is headed by an effective Board which is led by an Independent Non-Executive Chairman. Mr Mark Christopher Greaves ("Mr Greaves"), upon his last reelection as a Director at the Annual General Meeting ("AGM") on 28 April 2023, was appointed the new Independent Non-Executive Chairman of the Company. Mr Greaves is a former banker with extensive multi-jurisdictional board experience.

The Board is collectively responsible and works with Management for the long-term success of the Company by:

(i) Providing entrepreneurial leadership and guidance, setting strategic directions and objectives of the Group (which include appropriate focus on value creation, innovation and sustainability);  
(ii) Ensuring that adequate financial and human resources are in place for the Company to achieve its objectives;

(v) Instilling an ethical corporate culture and ensuring the Group's values, standards, policies and practices are consistent with the Group's culture;

In the case of any matter where the Chairman is conflicted, such as his remuneration or re-election as a Director, he will similarly recuse himself from participating in the discussion, and the other Directors will elect someone among themselves to preside over the discussion and to lead the Directors in decision making.

# 1.2 DIRECTORS' COMPETENCIES, INDUCTION, TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT

The Management will conduct a comprehensive orientation programme for newly appointed Directors, which covers, amongst other matters, duties as a Director and how to discharge those duties and key aspects of the Group's businesses, including financial and corporate governance policies. Site visits will also be arranged for new Directors so that they can better familiarise themselves with the Group's operations.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Regular presentations are made by the Management to the Board to enable the Directors to better familiarise themselves with the Group's businesses. Site visits for the Board are also organised from time to time to enable the Directors to learn more about the Group's operations. During such visits, the Directors spend time with the Management and/or business unit leaders to discuss new developments in the market, key strategies and policies pertaining to not just Company-specific operations but also the Group's businesses in general. The Directors also find time to interact with the Group's employees locally and overseas, to appreciate their perspective on the operations and business, as well as to listen to their aspirations and feedback on how to improve operational processes. Such meetings and interactions help the Directors to be better equipped to make informed decisions relating to the future direction of the Group. The Group also holds strategy meetings at least once every two (2) years for the Board to collaborate with the Management in developing the Group's future plans and proposals for new business opportunities. The latest such strategy meeting was held on 7 April 2024.

# 1.3 RESERVED MATTERS

ComfortDelGro has adopted clear, established, and documented internal guidelines for matters which require the Board's approval. Under these guidelines, Board approval is required with regard to matters such as acquisition of businesses, disposals of or changes in equity interests in existing subsidiaries/ associates, investment in financial instruments, tender for businesses, assessing and approving key business decisions, funding and investment initiatives and other corporate actions, in each case above the prescribed limits. The Board also approves the financial authority limits, annual budget and capital expenditure and the release of financial results to the SGX-ST via SGXNET. A special Board meeting is convened annually to discuss the budget taking into account the Group's strategy plans and business outlook by geography and business sectors. In addition, the acceptance of credit facilities from banks, the establishment of capital market programmes and the issuance of debt instruments and guarantees including the granting of any security or charges also require the approval of the Board.

The Board periodically reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls, risk management and financial authority limits to ensure that, while there is delegation of authority and empowerment, there are sufficient checks and balances in place to monitor compliance with delegated limits.

# 1.4 DELEGATION BY THE BOARD

To assist the Board in the detailed consideration of the various issues at hand and to facilitate decision making, four (4) Board Committees were established, namely, the Audit and Risk Committee ("ARC"), the Nominating and Remuneration Committee ("NRC"), the Strategy and Investment Committee ("SIC") and the Sustainability Committee ("SC") (collectively, the "Board Committees").

Ad-hoc committees are also formed to look at specific issues from time to time.

Each Board Committee is governed and regulated by its own terms of reference, which sets out the scope of its authority, duties and responsibilities, as well as the regulations and procedures governing the manner in which the Board Committee operates and how decisions are taken.

The terms of reference and summary of the activities of the ARC and NRC are described in further detail in the relevant sections below from pages 71 to 87.

# STRATEGY & INVESTMENT COMMITTEE

The SIC assists the Board to review and recommend investment strategies and opportunities to deliver steady and sustainable results through growth in the Company's business. The SIC monitors the economic landscapes and opportunities and guides the Group towards the longer-term strategy of expanding into new growth avenues by leveraging on its core strengths, in bus and rail business over and above the private mobility business. The SIC is chaired by the Chairman of the Board and is authorised to approve transactions within its delegated authority limit in relation to acquisitions and investments within the scope of existing and approved business as well as any divestment of existing businesses.

As at 31 December 2024, the SIC comprised six Directors, including the Chairman of the Board, Mr Greaves, the Deputy Chairman, Mr Choi Shing Kwok and the Managing Director/Group Chief Executive Officer ("MD/GCEO"), Mr Cheng Siak Kian. The SIC Chairman is Mr Greaves.

The key roles and responsibilities of the SIC include inter alia:

(i) Provide entrepreneurial leadership and guidance in developing strategic direction for business growth;  
(ii) Review and recommend to the Board new scope of business to be undertaken by the Company for approval;  
(iii) Review potential investments, mergers, acquisitions and divestments of businesses and other assets of the Group;  
(iv) Review and approve transactions within its delegated authority in relation to acquisitions and investments within the scope of existing and approved businesses and divestment of existing businesses; and  
(v) Oversee the implementation of the Corporate Strategic Plans of the Group.

# SUSTAINABILITY COMMITTEE

The SC assists the Board in fulfilling its corporate governance responsibilities in relation to the Group's sustainability policies and strategies by providing directions and considering ESG issues as part of its strategic formulation and investments. The SC seeks to integrate sustainability considerations in the business strategies of the Group to deliver steady and sustainable outcomes.

The Company had been included in the prestigious Dow Jones Best-in-Class Indices. ComfortDelGro is one of six Singapore companies, and the only one in the transport sector, listed in the regional index, which is the undisputed gold standard in sustainability benchmarking. More specifically, the Company was recognised for its performance in the areas of Materiality, Climate Strategy, Stakeholder Engagement, Business Ethics, Emissions, Information Security, Human Capital Development, Resource Efficiency and Circularity, Labour Practice Indicators and Privacy Protection.

As at 31 December 2024, the SC comprised six Directors, including the Chairman of the Board, Mr Greaves, the Deputy Chairman, Mr Choi Shing Kwok and the MD/GCEO, Mr Cheng Siak Kian. The Chairperson of the SC is Ms Jessica Cheam.

The key terms of reference of the SC include the following:

(i) Oversee the development, and review and monitor the performance of the Group's sustainability strategy, including materiality assessment and alignment of sustainable development policies with applicable laws and regulations;  
(ii) Review and monitor Management's commitment and allocation of resources to achieve the desired outcomes of the Group's sustainability strategy;  
(iii) Establish sustainability policies and practices, set and assess ESG targets, and measure the performance against targets, risks and opportunities;  
(iv) Ensure the Group's sustainability policies, strategies and priorities are integrated into the Group's strategic plans, investment strategy and business goals;  
(v) Monitor and consider emerging key ESG trends and issues that may have strategic, business and reputational implications for the Group, and receive periodic reports from the Management or external parties on the same, and make recommendations to the Board as necessary; and

(vi) Assist the Board in fulfilling its corporate governance responsibilities and legal obligations in relation to the Group's performance, practices, strategies and policies for workplace safety and health of its employees, contractors, customers, and others affected by its activities, including its obligations under the Workplace Safety and Health Act 2006, the Approved Code of Practice on Chief Executives' and Board of Directors' Workplace Safety and Health ("WSH") Duties ("COP") and other relevant legislation and regulations.

The SC also oversees Workplace, Safety and Health Policy matters, the details of which are on page 90.

# BOARD RISK COMMITTEE

Given the recent acquisitions in Australia, the United Kingdom and Europe, the Board will establish in the later part of 2025, a dedicated Board Risk Committee ("BRC"). The BRC will review and realign the Group's risk management strategy to enable the Board to effectively respond to emerging risk trends and opportunities to achieve sustainable growth on a global basis. Deputy Chairman, Mr Choi Shing Kwok will chair the new BRC.

Consequently, the ARC will be renamed the Audit Committee ("AC") concentrating on reviewing the Group's internal control systems and financial reporting processes and financial statements particularly given the different regulatory frameworks and compliance regimes across the Group's businesses.

Although the Board Committees are empowered to make their own decisions, the Board is ultimately responsible for all decisions made by the Board Committees.

# 1.5 DIRECTORS' ATTENDANCE AT BOARD AND BOARD COMMITTEE MEETINGS

At least five (5) scheduled Board Meetings are held every year at regular intervals for the purpose of reviewing the results and ongoing performance of the Group, notwithstanding that the financial results are only announced semi-annually. The Board Meetings to approve the half-year financial results are held within forty-five (45) days after the end of the first half of the financial year, and not later than sixty (60) days after the end of the financial year for the full-year financial results, while the Board Meeting to approve the annual budget is held in the last quarter of each year after all the budgets of the subsidiaries have been approved by their respective Boards. Ad-hoc Board and Board Committee Meetings are also held from time to time when the need arises.

Directors who are unable to attend meetings in person can participate in the discussions through video, audio, or tele-conferencing. Decisions of the Board and Board Committees on matters in the ordinary course of business may also be obtained via circular resolutions. Directors are free to seek clarifications and explanations from Management on the reports and papers submitted to the Board and Board Committees.

# Notes:

# 1.6 ACCESS TO INFORMATION

Prior to each Board and Board Committee Meeting, and where needed, the Management provides the Directors with complete, adequate and timely information to enable them to make informed decisions and discharge their duties and responsibilities. The Board also receives monthly management accounts, updates on key performance indicators and quarterly Investor Relations ("IR") Reports covering IR activities, and updates of analysts and investors views and comments. This enables the Board to make informed and sound business decisions and to keep abreast of key challenges, opportunities and developments for the Group. As a general rule, reports to the Board and Board Committees are disseminated to Directors prior to meetings to provide sufficient time for review and consideration, so that discussions at the meetings are productive and effective. All information is encrypted if distributed electronically.

# 1.7 INDEPENDENT PROFESSIONAL ADVICE

Directors can request for additional information and have full access to Management. Management provides information requested by Directors for their meetings

and decision making in a timely manner. Should there be a need to obtain independent professional advice on matters relating to the businesses of the Group or issues affecting the duties of the Directors, the Company will arrange for the appointment of relevant professional advisers at the Company's cost.

# 1.8 COMPANY SECRETARIES

The Company Secretaries assist in organising the Board and Board Committee Meetings and prepare the agenda in consultation with the Chairman, Managing Director/ Group Chief Executive Officer ("MD/GCEO") and the chairpersons of the respective Board Committees. At least one of the Company Secretaries attends all Board and Board Committee Meetings. The Company Secretaries keep the Directors informed of any significant developments or events relating to the Group, including updates on all relevant rules and regulations. The Directors have separate and independent access to the Company Secretaries. The appointment and removal of the Company Secretaries is subject to the approval of the Board.

# PRINCIPLE 2: BOARD COMPOSITION AND GUIDANCE

# BOARD COMPOSITION

The Company has consistently met or exceeded the minimum requirements of the 2018 Code and Rule 210(5)(c) of the SGX-ST Listing Manual by ensuring that at least one third of the Board is independent and the majority is non-executive. As of 31 December 2024, the Board comprised ten (10) Directors with 90 percent of the Board being Independent Directors ("IDs"). Except for the MD/GCEO who is an Executive Director, all the remaining nine (9) Non-Executive Directors ("NEDs") are duly considered by the NRC to be independent. There is no person who will be able to influence any decision of the Board as the Independent NEDs continue to be the majority.

# 2.1 INDEPENDENT JUDGEMENT

All Directors are aware of their fiduciary duties and exercise due diligence and independent judgement in ensuring that their decisions are objective and in the best interests of the Company and its Group.

In accordance with Regulation 104 of the Company's Constitution, no Director may vote in respect of any transaction or proposed transaction with the Company in which he/she has an interest or in respect of any matter arising from such transaction or proposed transaction. Each Director makes it a point to declare to the Board should he/she have any interest in the subject matter before any discussion or decision-making process and recuse himself/herself therefrom to avoid any compromise in the Board's objectivity, in its judgement or decision-making.

The Board's practices in relation to conflicts of interest are set out in the section "Conflicts of Interest" on page 65 above.

# 2.2 INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS

As mentioned above, as of 31 December 2024, Independent Directors made up 90 percent of the Board.

The Board composition, whether during FY2024 or as at 1 January 2025, exceeds the requirement under the SGX-ST Listing Manual and the 2018 Code that at least one third of the Board must be Independent Directors. It is also noted that the Chairman, Deputy Chairman and MD/GCEO are different persons and are not immediate family members, and the Chairman and Deputy Chairman are not part of the Management team. No person will be able to influence the decisions of the Board as the overwhelming majority of the Directors are Independent NEDs. There is a strong level of independence on the Board.

# ASSESSMENT OF DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE

In determining the independence of a Director with less than 9 years of service, the Board and NRC take a holistic approach, taking into consideration various factors such as whether the Director has any interest, business, relationship and/or any other material contractual

relationship with the Group which could compromise or reasonably be perceived to compromise his/her independence and interfere with the exercise of his/her independent business judgement. Except where SGX-ST Listing Rule 210(5)(d)(iv) which states that a Director will not be independent if he/she has been a Director of the issuer for an aggregate period of more than nine years (whether before or after listing) applies, the length of service is not a critical factor in determining the independence of any Director, but it should nevertheless remain one of the factors in considering Directors' independence. The Board is of the view that all Independent Directors remain independent in the exercise of their judgement on Board matters.

The NRC reviews the independence of the Directors of the Company on an annual basis, and as and when material circumstances change.

Each Director is required to complete a Confirmation of Independence checklist which is drawn up in accordance with Rule 210(5)(d) of the SGX Listing Rules and the 2018 Code and requires each Director to assess his/her own independence. Each Director is required to declare any circumstances in which he/she may be considered non-independent. The NRC will then review the Confirmation of Independence to determine whether a Director is independent.

The NRC determines Director independence in accordance with Rule 210(5)(d) of the SGX Listing Rules, which specifies that a Director is deemed non-independent if he/she:

(i) is or was employed by the Company or its related corporations in the current or past three financial years.  
(ii) has an immediate family member employed by the Company or its related corporations in the current or past three financial years, with remuneration determined by the NRC.  
(iii) has served as a director of the Company for more than nine years (whether before or after listing), though he/she may be considered independent until the next Annual General Meeting.

Beyond these criteria, the NRC and Board also assess other circumstances that may impact independence, including:

(i) A director, or his/her immediate family member, having provided to or received from the Company or any of its subsidiaries any significant payments or material services (for example, auditing, banking, consulting and legal services) in the current or immediate past financial year. Generally, payments exceeding S\\(50,000 in a financial year are deemed significant.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

(ii) A director, or his/her immediate family member, in the current or immediate past financial year being a substantial shareholder, partner (with 5 percent or more stake), executive officer, or director of an organisation that provided to or received from the Company or any of its subsidiaries any significant payments or material services. Payments exceeding S$200,000 in a financial year are typically considered significant.  
(iii) A director having a direct association with a substantial shareholder of the Company in the current or immediate past financial year.

These considerations ensure a robust and transparent assessment of director independence in alignment with corporate governance best practices.

The Board is of the view that all Independent Directors remain independent in the exercise of their judgement on Board matters. Other than the MD/GCEO who is in any event the Executive Director and hence non-independent, SGX-ST Listing Rule 210(5)(d)(iv) does not apply to any of the Directors in office as at 31 December 2024.

The NRC will continue to review the independence of the Directors of the Company on an annual basis and as and when material circumstances change.

# 2.3 NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS

As at 31 December 2024, the Board comprised ten (10) Directors with 90 percent of the Board being Independent Non-Executive Directors. The Independent NEDs are led by the Independent Non-Executive Chairman of the Board.

# 2.4 BOARD SIZE, COMPOSITION, DIVERSITY AND COMPETENCY

The NRC examines the size and composition of the Board and the Board Committees annually to ensure an appropriate balance and mix of skills, knowledge, experience and other aspects of diversity such as gender, age, nationality and ethnicity, and that the size is conducive for effective discussion and decision making, with an appropriate number of Independent Directors. The NRC also takes into consideration the promotion of tripartism experience from labour, government and business, to foster constructive debate and enhance the Board's ability to discharge its duties and responsibilities effectively.

The bulk of the Group's businesses is regulated. Having considered the scope and nature of the operations of the Group and the requirements of its businesses, the NRC and the Board are of the view that the current Board size of ten (10) Directors is appropriate.

The Group is committed to building an open, inclusive and collaborative culture and recognises the importance of all aspects of diversity in supporting the achievement of its strategic objectives, growth and sustainable development.

# BOARD DIVERSITY POLICY

The Company has adopted a Board Diversity Policy since 2019, reviewed annually, which seeks to ensure an appropriate balance and mix of skills, knowledge,

experience, age, gender, nationality, ethnicity and other aspects of diversity within the Board to avoid groupthink and bias, and instead foster constructive debate and achieve effective decision making in the best interests of the Group. Under the Board Diversity Policy, the NRC will discuss and agree annually on the relevant measurable targets for promoting and achieving diversity in the composition of the Board and Board Committees and make recommendations for consideration and approval by the Board.

In reviewing the Board composition and succession planning, the NRC considers various aspects of diversity, with all Board appointments and re-appointments based on merit, and due consideration being given to a candidate's suitability in strengthening the diversity of skills, experience, age, gender, knowledge and core competencies of the Board relevant to the Group. In relation to gender diversity, the Board ensures that female candidates are included for consideration when identifying suitable candidates for new appointments to the Board, and since 2022, the Board has adopted the guideline that at least one female Director sits on each Board Committee including the NRC. As at 31 December 2024, out of ten (10) directors on the Board, three (3) directors or 30 percent were females. In fact, there were at least two (2) female Directors on the ARC and the SC in FY2024. The Company has achieved the Board's target to have 30 percent female directors and has also exceeded the target of the Board Diversity Council to have at least 25 percent females on the Board by 2025.

The Directors are individuals with leadership experiences in business, government and the labour movement and have a broad diversity of expertise and experience including accounting, finance, legal, information technology, artificial intelligence, sustainability, and business management, both domestically and internationally. In addition, the Board also comprises Directors of different nationalities and ethnicities. They bring with them different perspectives of the business, locally and internationally, especially in Australia and the United Kingdom where the Group invests heavily in. Each Director provides a valuable network of industry contacts and a resource of his/her knowledge of different legal and regulatory regimes and corporate governance practice. Board discussions are always constructive and multi-dimensional with little room for any biasness or groupthink.

The NRC is satisfied that the current Board and Board Committees comprise Directors who, as a group, provide an appropriate balance and diversity of skills, knowledge, experience, age, gender, nationality, ethnicity and core competencies required for the Board and Board Committees to discharge their responsibilities effectively and ensure that the Group continues to be able to meet the challenges and demands of the markets in which it operates.

Mr Mark Christopher Greaves, Mr Choi Shing Kwok, Mr Russell Stephen Balding AO and Mr Lee Jee Cheng Philip are currently the longest-serving Independent Directors since being last re-elected. All Independent Directors on the Board of the Company have a tenure of less than nine (9) years, with an average tenure of about four (4) years two (2) months with Ms Tham as the longest serving director of seven (7) years nine (9)

months on the Board at the time of the coming AGM. The NRC and the Board review the size and composition of the Board annually to determine the optimal Board size and composition, with regards to the business and governance needs of the Group.

The Company sources for suitable candidates through the recommendations of the existing Directors, other contacts and a variety of independent sources which may include external consultants, to find the right match of potential candidates for the Company.

Nonetheless, the ultimate decision on selection of Directors will be based on merit against a set of objective criteria that complements and expands the talent, skills, knowledge, industry and business experience of the Board as a whole, and after giving due regard to the overall balance and effectiveness of a diverse Board to serve the needs of the Group.

The individual profiles of the Directors, their listed company directorships and principal commitments held currently and/or in the preceding five (5) years, are found in the "Board of Directors" and "Directors' Particulars" sections on pages 20 to 25 and 92 to 95 of this Annual Report.

# 2.5 NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' PARTICIPATION

In addition to the relevant monthly financial and business reports provided by the Management, the NEDs also have unrestricted access to the Management and the various business unit leaders to obtain up-to-date feedback and suggestions for improvement on any matter concerning business or governance. The NEDs participate actively at Board and Board Committee Meetings to constructively challenge Management and help develop proposals on business strategy and other business and governance issues.

The Board sets objectives and goals for the Management, monitors the results, and assesses and remunerates the Management in accordance with its performance. Executive Directors who are part of the Management may face a conflict of interest in these areas. To avoid any undue influence of the Management over the Board, the NEDs review the performance of the Management based on prescribed and agreed key performance indicators, goals and objectives, and ensure appropriate checks and balances are in place for the Board's independent assessment.

As of 31 December 2024, all the members of the ARC and NRC were Independent NEDs. There is no Executive Director appointed as a member of these Board Committees. However, the MD/GCEO is invited to attend the ARC and NRC meetings to provide feedback and emphasise the responsibilities placed on the Management.

The Independent Non-Executive Chairman, who is not a member of the ARC, meets with the Chairperson of the ARC and the External Auditors annually in the absence of the Management. The NEDs also meet regularly without the presence of the Management before or after Board Meetings. The Chairperson of such meetings provides feedback to the Board and/or the Chairman, as appropriate.

# PRINCIPLE 3: CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

# 3.1 CHAIRMAN AND MD/GCEO

The roles of the Chairman and the MD/GCEO are kept separate and distinct to ensure an appropriate balance of power, increased accountability, and greater capacity of the Board for independent decision making. This is a deliberate policy agreed by the Board and one that is strictly adhered to. This ensures Management accountability and Board independence.

# 3.2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF CHAIRMAN AND MD/GCEO

The responsibilities of the Chairman and the MD/GCEO are set out in writing. The Chairman is responsible for the effective functioning of the Board, and the MD/GCEO for the operations and management of the Group's businesses. The Chairman and the MD/GCEO are not related.

# ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CHAIRMAN

# The Chairman:

(i) Leads the Board, facilitates effective contribution of all Directors, sets the agenda and promotes comprehensive, rigorous and open discussions at Board meetings among the Directors, as well as between the Board and Management;  
(ii) Oversees the translation of the Board's decisions into executive actions;  
(iii) Ensures adequacy and timeliness of information flow between the Board and Management and effective communication with shareholders and other stakeholders;  
(iv) Encourages constructive conversations and cordial relations within the Board, between the Board and Management and the Board and the MD/GCEO; and  
(v) Promotes high standards of corporate governance and transparency.

# ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF MD/GCEO

# The MD/GCEO:

The MD/GCEO is the highest-ranking executive in the Group. His primary responsibilities include making major corporate decisions, managing the overall operations and resources of the Group, and acting as the main point of communication between the Board and corporate operations. He is responsible for implementing the corporate strategy and is accountable to the Board for the Group's performance and for ensuring efficient allocation of capital across the Group. The MD/GCEO is

also responsible for setting the example of leadership and creating a conducive environment towards a sustainable work culture that builds teams to succeed and attract talent. The MD/GCEO also serves as the public face of the Group, engaging with the media and public relations.

The MD/GCEO is given full executive responsibility for the management of the Group's businesses and the implementation of the Group's strategies and policies as decided by the Board, and reports to the Board on a regular basis.

# 3.3 LEAD INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR

The appointment of a Lead Independent Director is not required as the Chairman is an independent NED. Moreover, the majority of the Board, including the Chairman, are independent Directors and none of them are part of the Management team or have a relationship with the MD/GCEO and his/her immediate family members. Mr Choi Shing Kwok, an Independent NED, is the Deputy Chairman of the Board. The Deputy Chairman will step in as acting Chairman of the Board and preside over shareholder and Directors' meetings in the Chairman's absence, or where a motion of which the Chairman is personally interested or conflicted is being discussed. Further, the ARC Chairman is readily available to shareholders if they have concerns for which the normal channels of communication with the Chairman, Deputy Chairman or Management may be inappropriate or inadequate. Any matter that may give rise to a potential conflict of interests is dealt with in accordance with the procedure as mentioned under "Conflicts of Interests" on page 65.

# 3.4 INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS' COMMUNICATION

The Chairman and the MD/GCEO represent the Board at official functions and meetings with shareholders and other stakeholders such as employees, regulators and customers. A detailed description of our engagements with stakeholders can be found in our Sustainability Report.

# PRINCIPLE 4: BOARD MEMBERSHIP

There is a formal and transparent process for the appointment and re-appointment of Directors to the Board, taking into account the need for progressive renewal of the Board.

# 4.1 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE NOMINATING AND REMUNERATION COMMITTEE

The NRC is responsible for (i) regularly reviewing the composition of the Board, identifying and proposing suitable candidates for appointment to the Board and ensuring succession plans are in place; and (ii) setting the framework for Directors' Fees and the Group's remuneration policies and framework for Key

Management Personnel. Details of the NRC's role in relation to remuneration matters are found on pages 78 to 82 of this Annual Report.

The NRC ensures that the renewal of Board membership is an ongoing process to ensure good governance and maintain relevance in a changing business environment. All decisions by the NRC are made by a majority of votes of the NRC members who are present and voting. The key terms of reference of the NRC, in relation to nomination matters, include the following:

(i) Review the structure, size and composition of the Board;  
(ii) Review the succession plans for Directors, the talent management and succession plans for KMP, and make recommendations to the Board on the appointment, replacement and re-appointment of Directors and KMP, including the appointment and/or replacement of the Chairman and the MD/GCEO;  
(iii) Develop a process for performance evaluation of the Board, its Board Committees and individual Director's performance, including comparison with industry peers;  
(iv) Make recommendations to the Board on the review of training and professional development programmes for the Board and the Directors;  
(v) Assess the effectiveness of the Board and Board Committees and contributions by each individual Director; and  
(vi) Determine annually, and as and when circumstances require, if a Director is independent.

# 4.2 COMPOSITION OF THE NOMINATING AND REMUNERATION COMMITTEE

As at 31 December 2024, the NRC comprised six (6) independent NEDs. The composition of the NRC therefore complies with the requirement under the 2018 Code that specifies that the Nominating Committee comprises at least three (3) Directors, the majority of whom, including the Chairman, are independent.

# 4.3 PROCESS FOR SELECTION, APPOINTMENT AND RE-APPOINTMENT OF DIRECTORS

As part of the Board succession plan, potential candidates may be identified from time to time for appointment to the Board after the NRC evaluates and assesses their suitability in strengthening the diversity of skills, experience, age, gender, knowledge and relevant core competencies of the Board, whilst ensuring that there is a balanced tripartism experience from government, labour and business to avoid unproductive groupthink and bias.

The process for selection of new Directors is as follows:

(i) The NRC assesses the desired competencies and attributes of the Board taking into account the Group's businesses and its strategic objectives as well as the need for diversity on the Board.  
(ii) The NRC then assesses the competencies and attributes to include into the current representation to achieve the desired mix. This forms the basis for selection of new Directors.  
(iii) New Directors are sourced through various channels, including recommendations of Directors and Management and if required, external search consultants.  
(iv) Potential candidates are interviewed by the NRC to assess suitability and commitment.  
(v) The NRC makes recommendations to the Board for approval.

The Constitution of the Company provides that one-third of the Directors are subject to retirement and re-election by rotation at every AGM. All Directors are required to retire from office at least once every three (3) years. Re-election is, however, not automatic, and all Directors are assessed by the NRC on their competencies, commitment, past performance and contributions before being recommended to shareholders for re-election at the AGM. Newly appointed Directors are also subject to retirement and re-election at the AGM immediately following their appointments. At the forthcoming AGM, Mr Mark Christopher Greaves, Mr Choi Shing Kwok, Mr Russell Stephen Balding AO and Mr Lee Jee Cheng Philip are due for re-election pursuant to Regulation 93 of the Company's Constitution. There were no newly appointed Directors after the last Annual General Meeting, hence there will be no re-elections pursuant to Regulations 99 of the Constitution at the coming AGM.

# Alternate Director

Consistent with the 2018 Code, there are no alternate Directors on the Board.

# 4.4 REVIEW OF INDEPENDENCE

As of 31 December 2024, except for Mr Cheng Siak Kian who is the MD/GCEO of the Company and therefore, not an Independent Director, there was no Director who is deemed non-independent as set forth in Provision 2.1 of the 2018 Code and Rule 210(5)(d)(iv) of the SGX-ST Listing Manual.

The NRC has reviewed the independence of Professor Ooi Beng Chin and Ms Susan Kong Yim Pui and recommended to the Board that they continue to be deemed Independent Directors of the Company for the reasons set out below. The Board has concurred with the NRC's views.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

# 1. Professor Ooi Beng Chin ("Professor Ooi")

(a) In the case of Professor Ooi, the NRC noted that Professor Ooi is a Non-Independent Non-Executive Director of VICOM Ltd ("VICOM"), a principal subsidiary of the Company. He was appointed to VICOM's board in 2023 to help enhance its competencies in the area of new technologies, big data management and digitalisation. The value of transactions between the Group (excluding VICOM and its subsidiaries) on the one hand and VICOM and its subsidiaries ("VICOM Group") on the other was in excess of S$200,000 for FY2024. All transactions were on an arm's length basis.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board concurred with the view and recommendation by the NRC that Professor Ooi remains an Independent Director of the Company for the following reasons:

(i) The value of transactions in FY2024 between the Group and the VICOM Group was not substantial in relation to the total revenue of the Group or the VICOM Group. Further, all transactions were on an arm's length basis;

(ii) Professor Ooi would declare any conflict of interest and recuse himself from deliberating and voting on any matter that involves the VICOM Group;

(iii) Professor Ooi's independence is reviewed annually or as and when necessary; and

(iv) Professor Ooi is and has been acting in the best interests of the Company.

# 2. Ms Susan Kong Yim Pui ("Ms Kong")

(a) In the case of Ms Kong, the NRC noted that she is a Non-Independent Non-Executive Director of SBS Transit Ltd ("SBS Transit"), a principal subsidiary of the Company. The value of transactions between the Group (excluding SBS Transit and its subsidiaries) on the one hand and SBS Transit and its subsidiaries ("SBST Group") on the other was in excess of S$200,000 for FY2024. All transactions were on an arm's length basis.  
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board concurred with the view and recommendation by the NRC that Ms Kong remains an Independent Director of the Company for the following reasons:  
(i) The value of transactions in FY2024 between the Group and the SBST Group was not substantial in relation to the total revenue of the Group or the SBST Group. Further, the transactions were on an arm's length basis;  
(ii) Ms Kong would declare any conflict of interest and recuse herself from deliberating and voting on any matter that involves the SBST Group;

(iii) Ms Kong's independence is reviewed annually or as and when necessary; and  
(iv) Ms Kong is and has been acting in the best interest of the Company.

# 4.5 MULTIPLE DIRECTORSHIPS AND PRINCIPAL COMMITMENTS

The NRC subscribes to the view that it is important for Directors to devote sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the Group. Consistent with the guidelines in the 2018 Code, the NRC and the Board have adopted the following as a proactive step to ensure this:

(i) A Director who is in full-time employment should not serve as a Director on the board of more than two (2) listed companies; and  
(ii) A Director who is not in full-time employment should not serve as a Director on the board of more than five (5) listed companies.

Listed companies within a group should be considered as one (1) entity.

As the number of board representations should not be the only measure of a Director's commitment and ability to contribute effectively, the NRC takes the view that if a Director wishes to hold more board representations than the maximum stated in the guidelines, a request must be made to the Chairman of the Board for approval. As a policy, the Chairman himself should not hold more than five (5) directorships in listed companies if he is not in full-time employment and not more than two (2) directorships in listed companies if he is in full-time employment.

In assessing a Director's contribution, the NRC takes a holistic approach. Focusing solely on the Directors' attendance at the Board and Board Committee Meetings per se may not be an adequate evaluation of the contribution of the Directors. Instead, their ability to provide valuable insights and strategic networking to enhance the businesses of the Group, availability for guidance and advice outside the scope of formal Board and Board Committee Meetings and contributions in specialised areas are also relevant factors in assessing the contributions of the Directors.

As a policy, the MD/GCEO, being an Executive Director of the Company, besides adhering to the guidelines set on the maximum number of board representations on listed companies, will also have to seek the approval of the Chairman before accepting any directorships of companies not within the Group. In considering whether or not to grant the approval, the Chairman will consider the time commitment of the MD/GCEO and whether the new external directorships will provide strategic fit and networking for the businesses of the Group. The Chairman will also ensure that the MD/GCEO does not accept appointments to the boards of competitors.

As of 31 December 2024, all Directors complied with the guidelines on multiple board representation.

# 4.6 BOARD SUCESSION PLANNING

The NRC makes recommendations to the Board on the review of succession planning for Directors, in particular the Chairman and the MD/GCEO, as well as KMP, as follows:

(i) Long-term planning, to identify competencies needed for the Company's strategy and objectives;  
(ii) Medium-term planning, for the orderly replacement of Board members and KMP; and  
(iii) Contingency planning, for preparedness against sudden and unforeseen changes.

In relation to Directors, the NRC aims to maintain an optimal Board composition by considering the trends and factors affecting the long-term success of the Company, reviewing the skills needed, and identifying gaps, which includes considering whether there is an appropriate level of diversity of thought.

In relation to KMP succession, the NRC takes an active interest in the performance and management of key talent within the Group, including identifying strong candidates and developing them to take on senior positions in the future.

# 4.7 KEY INFORMATION ON DIRECTORS

The profiles and key information on the Directors are set out in this Annual Report from pages 20 to 25. The Notice of AGM presents the Directors proposed for re-election or re-appointment at the forthcoming AGM. Key information on Directors are also available on the Company's website.

# PRINCIPLE 5: BOARD PERFORMANCE

Each year, the Board undertakes a formal annual assessment of its effectiveness as a whole, and of each of its Board Committees and individual Directors.

# 5.1 BOARD PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

The NRC is delegated by the Board to undertake a process to assess the effectiveness of the Board in terms of overall performance and growth of the Group, achieving a reasonable return for shareholders, preventing conflicts of interest and balancing the competing demands of the Group. In evaluating the contributions and performance of each individual Director, factors taken into consideration include attendance at AGMs, Board and Board Committee Meetings and corporate activities, contributions in specialist areas and maintenance of independence.

The performance criteria are determined by the NRC and approved by the Board, and do not change from year to year.

# 5.2 ANNUAL BOARD PERFORMANCE EVALUATION PROCESS

As part of the Company's digitalisation efforts and to increase efficiency in the collation of the yearly Board and Board Committees performance evaluation results, the Company has used a digital platform to enable the Directors to complete all the relevant performance evaluation forms electronically.

The following performance evaluation exercises were completed for FY2024:

(i) Individual Director Self-Assessment ("IDSA");  
(ii) Board Committee Performance Evaluation for the ARC, NRC, SIC and SC; and  
(iii) Board Performance Evaluation ("Board PE").

The procedures to complete the electronic performance evaluation are as follows:

# (i) Individual Director Self-Assessment

Each Director will complete an electronic IDSA Form. The Company Secretary will generate the report from the system and send it to the Chairman of the NRC and Board to review.

# (ii) Board Committee Performance Evaluation for Audit and Risk Committee, Nominating and Remuneration Committee, Strategy & Investment Committee and Sustainability Committee

The respective Board Committee members will complete the relevant electronic Board Committee performance evaluation forms. The Company Secretary will generate a summary of the respective Board Committee performance evaluation results and responses from members for the relevant Chairperson to review, evaluation and address any area for improvement identified. The final performance evaluation results of all the Board Committees will then be submitted to the NRC for review and evaluation and subsequently to the Board for final review, evaluation, and decision on the follow-up actions to address areas for improvement.

# (iii) Board Performance Evaluation

The NRC members are responsible for completing the electronic Board PE Form. The Company Secretary will generate a summary of the Board performance evaluation results for the NRC Chairman to review and evaluate before submitting to the Board for final review, evaluation, and decision on the follow-up actions to address areas for improvement.

In evaluating the performance of the Board, the NRC and the Board will take into account the results of the performance evaluation of the Board Committees.

The performance evaluation includes key points such as the Board composition and size, Board accountability, conduct of Board and Board Committee meetings, standards of conduct and whether the Directors have discharged their duties effectively.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

# 2. REMUNERATION MATTERS

# PRINCIPLE 6: PROCEDURES FOR DEVELOPING REMUNERATION POLICIES

ComfortDelGro recognises the importance of having a skilled and dedicated workforce to manage and grow the businesses in an increasingly competitive and challenging environment. It therefore places great emphasis on motivating staff through engagement, recognition and an alignment of rewards to corporate and individual performance, as well as long-term interests of the Group and shareholders.

The Board has a formal and transparent process for developing policies on Director and executive remuneration, and for fixing the remuneration packages of individual Directors and Key Management Personnel. No Director is involved in deciding his/her own remuneration.

# 6.1 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE NOMINATING AND REMUNERATION COMMITTEE

The NRC plays an important role in setting the Group's remuneration framework and strategy for compensation of both Directors and Key Management Personnel. As per the terms of reference, the NRC makes recommendations to the Board on the specific remuneration package for each Director, appropriate to the level of contributions. In respect of the Key Management Personnel, it reviews their remuneration with the purpose of developing talent and building leadership bench strength to ensure the Group's continued success and the enhancement of shareholder value.

# 6.2 COMPOSITION OF THE NOMINATING AND REMUNERATION COMMITTEE

The 2018 Code stipulates that the Remuneration Committee comprises at least three (3) Directors, all of whom are non-executive and the majority of whom, including the Chairman of such Committee, are independent. As at 31 December 2024, the NRC comprised six (6) independent NEDs.

# 6.3 REMUNERATION MATTERS

The NRC considers all aspects of remuneration including the terms of termination, to ensure that they are fair.

Members of the NRC are NEDs, all of whom, including the Chairperson of the NRC, are independent of the Management and free from any business or other relationships, which may materially interfere with the exercise of independent judgement.

All decisions by the NRC are made by a majority of votes of the NRC members who are present and voting. Any member of the NRC with a conflict of interest in relation to the subject matter under consideration will abstain from voting, approving or making recommendations

that would affect the decisions of the NRC. The MD/ GCEO is not present and does not participate in any NRC discussions pertaining to his own compensation and the review of his performance. He is, however, in attendance when the compensation of other Key Management Personnel is discussed. No Director is involved in deciding his/her own remuneration.

The key terms of reference of the NRC, in relation to remuneration matters, include the following:

(i) Establish a formal and transparent procedure for developing the Group's remuneration policies and fix the remuneration packages for individual Directors and Key Management Personnel, and review the remuneration framework and strategy for executive compensation, with the purpose of developing talent and building leadership bench strength to ensure the Group's continued success;  
(ii) Review and recommend to the Board the remuneration framework and the specific remuneration package for each Director, and ensure that the level of remuneration offered is appropriate to the level of contribution;  
(iii) Review and approve the remuneration framework and the specific remuneration packages of Key Management Personnel to ensure that they are aligned with the long-term interests of the Group and are appropriate to attract, retain and motivate Key Management Personnel to provide good stewardship of the Group and to successfully manage the Group for the long term;  
(iv) Review the Group's obligations arising in the event of termination of Directors' and Key Management Personnel's services to ensure they are fair, reasonable and equitable, including the cessation of financial incentives that have been earned but not yet disbursed due to exceptional circumstances of misstatement or misconduct; and  
(v) Review and approve the grant of performance share awards under the ComfortDelGro Executive Share Award Scheme to Group employees and Executive Directors.

# 6.4 ACCESS TO COMFORTDELGRO GROUP CHIEF HUMAN RESOURCE OFFICER AND APPOINTMENT OF EXTERNAL REMUNERATION CONSULTANTS

The NRC has unrestricted access to the Group Chief Human Resource Officer, who attends all NRC meetings. acts as a co-secretary of the NRC, and provides the relevant market remuneration data and practices to the Committee. The NRC may also seek external expert advice on such matters where needed. When such advice is sought, the NRC will ensure that there

is no existing relationship between the Group and its appointed consultants that will affect the independence and objectivity of the consultants. In 2024, Willis Towers Watson was engaged to advise the Company on the executive-compensation packages.

The Company had engaged the services of an external independent consulting firm, Korn Ferry, in 2023 to assess the appropriateness of the NEDs' remuneration for FY2024. Korn Ferry benchmarked the Directors' Fees against other companies with similar revenue and market capitalisation levels and took into account the Directors' level of contributions, time and effort spent on discharging their responsibilities. It was determined that the Directors' Fees were generally competitive with companies within the peer group except for the fees for the Board Chairman, the ARC Chairman and Members, and the SC Chairman and Members which were below market rate. The Directors' Fees for the positions had been moderated to be more competitive but reasonable in reflecting their roles and efforts in discharging their responsibilities as Independent Non-Executive Directors.

It is the view of the NRC that there has been no existing relationship between both Korn Ferry and Willis Towers Watson and the Group, and there was therefore sufficient independence and objectivity in their assessment of the compensation packages.

# PRINCIPLE 7: LEVEL AND MIX OF REMUNERATION

The Group is transparent about its remuneration policies, level and mix of remuneration, the procedures for setting remuneration, and the relationship between remuneration, performance and value creation.

The level and structure of remuneration of the Board and Key Management Personnel are appropriate and proportionate to the sustained performance and value creation of the Group, taking into account the strategic objectives of the Group, and are suitable to attract, retain and motivate the Directors and Key Management Personnel to successfully manage the Group for the long term.

# 7.1 PERFORMANCE-RELATED REMUNERATION

The Group is committed to creating and enhancing shareholder value through growth that is sustainable and profitable. The remuneration packages of the MD/ GCEO and Key Management Personnel comprise fixed and variable components, and are appropriate and proportionate to the sustained performance and value creation of the Group. The variable component in the form of year-end performance bonuses represents a significant proportion of the remuneration packages, and is dependent on the profitability of the Group and individual performance. Subject to market conditions and the operating environment, the Group's guidelines

on fixed to variable component ratios in respect of compensation packages are 70:30 for Rank-and-File Employees, 60:40 for Middle Management staff and 50:50 for Senior Management staff. Notwithstanding the guidelines, the actual remuneration packages for employees are ultimately determined on a case-by-case basis with the aim of maximising employee engagement and retention. The Group believes that a higher proportion of performance-related components would ensure greater alignment of interests of the employees with those of shareholders and contribute to sustainable performance and value creation in the long term. In addition, the remuneration of the MD/GCEO is also tied to the return on shareholder funds vis-à-vis the weighted average cost of capital and the level of profitability achieved.

# SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM INCENTIVE SCHEMES - COMFORTDELGRO EXECUTIVE SHARE AWARD SCHEME ("CDG ESAS" OR THE "SCHEME") $^{(1)}$

The Company obtained shareholder approval at its AGM held on 26 April 2018 to implement the CDG ESAS for Executive Directors and key executives as part of the long-term incentive programme to attract talent, retain them and reward those who make significant contributions to the Group.

Share awards are granted conditional upon performance targets being met and have a vesting schedule whereby only a portion of the benefits will be vested each year. The grant of the shares may be withdrawn or clawed back in the event of exceptional circumstances of material misstatement of financial results or misconduct resulting in financial or other losses for the Group.

The aggregate number of shares which may be issued pursuant to the Scheme and any other share-based schemes (if applicable) shall not exceed in aggregate (for the entire duration of the Scheme) two percent (2%) of the total number of issued shares (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings) from time to time.

In FY2024, the Company granted the total share awards of 1,670,000 ordinary shares (FY2023: 920,000) pursuant to the Scheme to selected employees of the Group. This included an award of 200,000 ordinary shares to the MD/ GCEO, Mr Cheng Siak Kian. These are time-based awards for FY2024 that comprise two components as follows:

(i) Restricted Shares Component to be vested over a 3-year period; and  
(ii) Performance Shares Component to be vested after a 3-year period, subject to achievement of set targets.

No participants to the CDG ESAS are controlling shareholders of the Company or their associates.

The Board and the members of the NRC who administer the Scheme, believe that the Scheme will help ensure that the Group continues to have a strong leadership team, credible talent pipeline and reinforce the delivery of long-term shareholder value.

# 7.2 REMUNERATION OF NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS

The structure for the payment of fees to NEDs is based on a framework comprising basic fees, attendance fees and additional fees for serving on Board Committees and also, where applicable, for undertaking additional services for the Group. The fees are subject to the approval of shareholders at the AGM.

The MD/GCEO, being the Executive Director of the Company, does not receive any fees paid by the Company's subsidiaries for his directorships with the subsidiaries and such fees are instead paid directly by the subsidiaries to the Company. The MD/GCEO does not receive Director's fees for his directorship in the Company.

The Directors' fee structure for FY2024 is set out below:

<table><tr><td>BOARD</td><td>BASIC FEE (PER ANNUM)</td></tr><tr><td>CHAIRMAN</td><td>S$150,000</td></tr><tr><td>DEPUTY CHAIRMAN</td><td>S$79,000</td></tr><tr><td>MEMBER</td><td>S$59,000</td></tr></table>

# 7.3 REMUNERATION OF DIRECTORS AND KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL

The NRC and the Board have reviewed and are satisfied that the framework for remuneration and specific remuneration package for each Director as well as for the Key Management Personnel are appropriate to attract, retain and motivate the Directors to provide good stewardship of the Company and Key Management Personnel to successfully manage the Company for the long term.

# 3. ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT

The Board has overall accountability to the shareholders of the Company and ensures that the Group is managed well and guided by sustainable long-term strategic objectives. The Board is responsible for providing a balanced and understandable assessment of the Group's performance, position and prospects. Material price-sensitive and trade-sensitive information, Annual Reports, and other material corporate developments are disseminated in a timely and transparent manner and posted on the Company's website as well as SGXNET. The financial results are reported semi-annually via SGXNET with an accompanying Negative Assurance by the Board to confirm that nothing has come to its attention that may render the results false or misleading in any material aspect. The Company believes that prompt and full compliance with statutory reporting requirements is fundamental to maintaining shareholder confidence and trust.

# DEALINGS IN SECURITIES

The Group has a formal policy ("Policy on Securities – Restrictions Against Dealings") to provide Directors and executives of the Group with guidance in relation to dealings in the Company's securities. Directors and executives of the Group are prohibited from dealing in the securities of the Company and its listed subsidiaries, SBS Transit and VICOM, during the period commencing one month before the

announcement of the Company's and its listed subsidiaries' semi-annual results or full-year results (as the case may be) and ending on the date of the announcement of the relevant results. All Directors and executives are notified of the trading blackout periods before the start of the financial year and are given reminders prior to each trading blackout period.

All Directors and executives of the Group are also told that they must not deal in (i) the securities of the Company and its listed subsidiaries, SBS Transit and VICOM, on short-term considerations and/or while in possession of unpublished material price-sensitive and trade-sensitive information relating to the relevant securities; and (ii) the securities of other listed companies while in possession of unpublished material price-sensitive and trade-sensitive information relating to those securities. Executives are required to notify the Company of any acquisition or disposal of shares in the Company, including transactions arising from open market purchases or disposal, in compliance with the Company's disclosure requirements.

The Group has put in place a standard operating procedure ("SOP") on compilation of information on privy persons who have access to material information of transactions that have yet to be disclosed to the public. The SOP prescribes that the person-in-charge of such transactions must remind all privy persons to keep all material information strictly confidential.

# PRINCIPLE 9: RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL

The Board is responsible for the governance of risk and ensures that the Management maintains a sound system of risk management and internal control to safeguard the interests of the Company and its shareholders.

# 9.1 DETERMINATION OF THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF SIGNIFICANT RISKS

Risk management is an important and integral part of ComfortDelGro's strategic planning and decision-making process. The Board is responsible for the governance of risk, and with the assistance of the Audit and Risk Committee, oversees the Company's risk management framework and policies. Key and emerging risks are identified by Senior Management on a regular basis, and reported to the Board quarterly, through the Audit and Risk Committee. Ownership of the risk management process is clearly defined and cascaded to the executive and functional levels, with stewardship retained at Senior Management level. Action plans necessary to manage the risks are in place, and key risk indicators are monitored to ensure risks are managed within the Board's risk appetite. The adequacy and effectiveness of the risk governance, risk policy and internal controls are also assessed as part of the process, through the annual management control self-assessment. Based on these reviews, the Board is of the view, with the concurrence of the Audit and Risk Committee, that the risk management systems and internal controls (covering the principal risk categories

of financial, operational, compliance and information technology) for the Group are adequate and effective. A detailed description of the Group's approach to internal controls and risk management can be found from pages 96 to 111 of this Annual Report.

As part of the risk management process, all businesses are required to refresh their risk inventories, conduct risk prioritisation exercises, identify key and emerging risks, and develop the requisite risk control and risk treatment action plans. The identified risks, their indicators and action plans are continually reviewed and reported.

The Internal and External Auditors conduct reviews in accordance with their respective audit plans. Any material non-compliance and recommendations for improvements on the internal controls are reported to the ARC. The ARC also reviews the effectiveness of the actions taken by the Management on the recommendations made by the Internal and External Auditors. The recommendations are followed up as part of the Group's continuous review of the system of internal control. However, there is no system of internal controls and risk management that can provide absolute assurance against human errors, frauds and other irregularities.

# 9.2 ASSURANCE FROM THE MD/GCEO, GROUP DEPUTY CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER /GROUP CHIEF CORPORATE SERVICES OFFICER AND THE KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL

For FY2024, the Board has received assurance from the MD/GCEO and the Group Deputy Chief Executive Officer/Group Chief Corporate Services Officer ("GDCEO") that:

(ii) the Group's internal control systems (including financial, operational, compliance and information technology control) and risk management systems are adequate and effective.

evaluation of the GCIAO. The GCIAO's remuneration is reviewed by the ARC Chairman together with the MD/GCEO in accordance with the Company's financial authority limits before they submit their recommendation to the Chairman and/or the NRC for consideration, as the case may be.

The Group Internal Audit Division adopts a risk-based approach in its continuous audit work with focus on material internal control systems including financial, operational, information technology and compliance controls. It provides an independent and objective evaluation of the internal control systems and corporate governance processes of the Group. The annual audit plan is developed by the GCIAO in consultation with, but independent of, Management and is subject to the ARC's approval before the start of each financial year. Quarterly internal audit reports are also prepared and submitted to the ARC. Any material non-compliance or lapses in internal controls are reported to the ARC and the MD/GCEO for improvements to be made.

# 10.7 REVIEW OF INDEPENDENCE OF EXTERNAL AUDITORS

Prior to the re-appointment of the External Auditors, the ARC assesses their independence based on the guidelines set by the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority and the Accountants Act 2004 of Singapore. Having satisfied itself that the independence of the External Auditors, EY, is not impaired by their provision of non-audit services to the Group and that Rules 712, 715 and 716 of the SGX-ST Listing Manual have been complied with, the ARC has recommended to the Board to nominate EY for re-appointment as the Company's External Auditors at the next AGM.

As a further safeguard of EY's independence, the Company will require the firm to change their partner-in-charge once every five (5) years if it continues to engage them in subsequent years.

# 10.8 WHISTLEBLOWING POLICY

The Group's Whistleblowing Policy, which is published on the corporate website, provides a mechanism for

# PRINCIPLE 11: SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS AND CONDUCT OF GENERAL MEETINGS

# 11.1 DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO SHAREHOLDERS

The Company notifies shareholders in advance of the dates of release of its financial results through the Company's website as well as SGXNET. Communications with shareholders are conducted through announcements to the SGXNET, media and analyst briefings after the announcement of the financial results together with its presentation materials, as well as the posting of announcements and press releases on the Company's website. The Group has formulated a Policy on Securities - Drafting and Releasing SGX-ST Announcements to provide guidance on preparation of SGX-ST announcements.

Shareholders may send in their requests or queries through the feedback channel provided on the Company's website. The ComfortDelGro Group's IR team is accessible throughout the year to address shareholders' queries. The contact details of the ComfortDelGro Head of Group Investor Relations can be found on the Company's website.

Beyond complying with the requirements of the 2018 Code, the SGX-ST Listing Manual and the Companies Act, the Company has also taken various additional measures to enhance corporate governance and improve transparency, including ensuring:

(i) The Notice of AGM is released publicly at least twenty-eight (28) days before the AGM is held; and

# 11.2 RESOLUTIONS AND VOTING AT GENERAL MEETINGS

Each issue or matter requiring shareholder approval is tabled as a separate and distinct resolution. All resolutions at the shareholder meetings are single-item resolutions. The Company does not practise bundling of resolutions. The Company will consider implementing absentia voting methods such as voting via mail, e-mail or fax when security, integrity and other pertinent issues are satisfactorily resolved.

The Constitution of the Company provides for voting in person and by proxy at the AGM of the Company. Each shareholder is allowed to appoint up to two (2) proxies to vote on his/her behalf at shareholder meetings through proxy forms sent in advance. Relevant intermediaries such as the Central Provident Fund and custodian banks

are entitled to appoint more than two proxies to attend, speak and vote at shareholder meetings. Shareholders who hold shares through these relevant intermediaries will be allowed to attend, speak and vote at the AGM subject to being appointed a proxy by their respective relevant intermediaries.

The Company has adopted electronic poll voting for general meetings since 2011 to ensure greater transparency and efficiency in the voting process and results. Shareholders are invited to vote on each of the resolutions by poll, using an electronic voting system. The results of all votes cast for or against each resolution or abstentions, if any, and the respective percentages (voting results) and the names of the independent scrutiners for the AGM are presented during the AGM and are announced via the SGXNET after the AGM. Voting by poll is the most accurate means of tabulating shareholders' votes according to the number of shares owned. The Company believes that this will encourage greater shareholder participation at the Company's general meetings and demonstrates the Company's commitment to high standards of corporate governance and transparency.

# 11.3 CONDUCT OF SHAREHOLDER MEETINGS INCLUDING DIRECTORS' ATTENDANCE

The Company encourages and supports shareholder participation at general meetings, and views the AGM as a good opportunity for shareholders to meet the Board and Senior Management.

All registered shareholders are invited to attend and participate actively in the AGM and are given the opportunity to seek clarification and/or to question the Group's strategic direction, business, operations, performance and proposed resolutions.

All Directors including the Chairman, MD/GCEO and the Chairpersons of the various Board Committees together with Senior Management and the Company Secretaries are present to address any question or feedback raised by the shareholders at the AGM and thereafter, including those pertaining to the proposed resolutions before they are voted on. The External Auditors are also present to address shareholders' queries about the conduct of audit and the preparation and contents of the Auditor's Report.

and proxies attending the Physical Meeting and Virtual Meeting. Shareholders who are not able to attend the AGM in person or those who prefer to attend the live webcast may do so by audio or audio-visual means.

The Company declares dividends semi-annually and informs its shareholders of the dividend payments via announcements to SGXNET. Special dividends may also be declared when the Company has achieved extraordinary gains or is celebrating a significant milestone.

# 13.1 IDENTIFICATION OF AND ENGAGEMENT WITH MATERIAL STAKEHOLDERS

The Company has arrangements in place to enable it to engage stakeholders so as to better understand and take action to address their needs and interests. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has been taking every opportunity to make use of digital means to communicate with shareholders. The Company was one of the first companies in Singapore to hold hybrid meetings for its shareholders, with real-time communication and real-time live voting.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

# 13.2 MANAGEMENT OF STAKEHOLDER RELATIONSHIPS

The basis for and methods of engagement with stakeholders, along with the key areas of focus for each stakeholder group, can be found in our Sustainability Report. Our Sustainability Report highlights the economic, environmental and social aspects of our developments and operations in accordance with the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards 2021 and complies with the relevant requirements under the SGX-ST Listing Manual including Rules 711A and 711B. As part of the Company's sustainability efforts and to ensure more efficient engagement, the Company encourages all shareholders to give their express consent to receive communications to shareholders, including statutory notices for general meetings and other circulars, via email and digital platforms.

# 13.3 CORPORATE WEBSITE

The Company's website is regularly updated to communicate and engage with stakeholders.

# 6. ADDITIONAL MEASURES TO ENHANCE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

The Company has also undertaken various additional measures to enhance corporate governance as follows:

# CORPORATE GIFTS/ENTERTAINMENT POLICY

Whilst business gifts and entertainment are courtesies that build goodwill and sound working relationships among business partners, the Group does not tolerate the improper use of gifts or entertainment to gain any special advantage in a business relationship.

The Group discourages the receipt of gifts or acceptance of entertainment, loans or other favours as these may compromise an employee's ability to make objective, independent and fair business decisions. Offering excessive gifts, in whatever form, or entertainment to others can also be open to misinterpretation.

Employees are therefore not permitted to offer or accept any gifts or entertainment without first seeking their supervisor's authorisation. Employees who receive gifts directly or indirectly in relation to their employment with the Group are expected to notify their supervisors and declare such gifts to the Group Human Resource Department. All gifts declared are processed through structured corporate procedures to ensure proper accountability.

Business gifts presented and entertainment on the Group's behalf are consistent with generally accepted corporate governance business practices and ethical standards and do not violate any applicable laws, regulations or policies of any country that the Group operates in or any company with which the Group has dealings.

# ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICY

The Group complies with all applicable laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates and conducts business in an open and transparent manner. It prohibits employees from directly or indirectly offering, promising to pay, or authorising the payment of money or anything of value for the purpose of gaining perceived advantage for the Group. All employees are responsible for following the Group's procedures, including audit controls, and for carrying out and reporting business transactions.

# BLOCK LEAVE POLICY

As a further risk mitigation measure and to enhance governance, the Group has a Block Leave Policy in place which applies to employees holding key functions. This arrangement allows covering officers to fully step into the duties of the employees on leave as an additional check and balance against any breaches.

# HEALTH AND SAFETY POLICY

Given the nature of the Group's businesses, the health and safety of the employees and customers are of paramount importance. Safety is, therefore, a perpetual top priority for the Group's operations. The Group complies with applicable statutory requirements and regulations in respect of health and safety, and has put in place procedures to guide proper safe work practices for the well-being of all employees and customers.

In 2022, following the issuance of the COP, the Group reviewed its work procedures and processes to ensure that its safety policies, standards and practices comply with the Workplace Safety and Health Act 2006 and the COP.

The Group's current safety policies, standards and practices adhere to the core principles and measures set out in the COP.

Employees are sent for training to equip them with greater awareness and knowledge of good WSH practices. Employees are required to observe safety rules and carry out safe work practices that apply to their jobs to ensure a safe work environment for everyone. They are also strongly encouraged to surface safety issues to improve safety standards at the workplace.

# INFORMATION PROTECTION POLICY

The Group has also implemented an Information Protection Policy to ensure that all documents and data information of the Group are properly safeguarded.

Information is classified into strictly confidential, confidential-sensitive, confidential, restricted and unrestricted use based on its nature, content and implications. Processes and systems used to store, process or communicate information provide protection from unauthorised disclosure and use.

# DATA PROTECTION POLICY

All Business Units are required to comply with applicable laws pertaining to data protection. In particular, the business units in Singapore have implemented data protection policies and practices to ensure compliance with the obligations under the Personal Data Protection Act 2012, including the Do Not Call provisions that came into force in 2014.

# CYBERSECURITYPOLICY

The Group has adopted the international Information Security Standard ISO 27000 in assessing and formulating the Group's cybersecurity framework. The Group regularly reviews its cybersecurity measures to ensure effective protection of its information technology systems and databases. The Group has implemented multi-layered defences, including firewalls, intrusion prevention system, network access control, server hardening, data encryption and employee security training. The Group keeps abreast of the evolving threats and the latest techniques, and actively collaborates with cybersecurity authorities and regulators to develop appropriate countermeasures.

The Group will continue to strengthen its capabilities in light of the way cybersecurity risks will evolve with the digital age. As and when necessary, the Group will take appropriate risk management decisions and implement security controls to secure its information infrastructure systems and

databases. The Group has established protocols to deal with cybersecurity incidents in the event that a threat is detected.

# SUPPLIER ETHICS POLICY

The Group procures a wide range of goods and services from various businesses, companies, persons and entities and requires its suppliers to be in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and practises fair competition in accordance with local anti-trust and competition regulations. Suppliers must conduct their businesses with integrity, transparency and honesty and the Group does not condone any corrupt or fraudulent practices.

Suppliers must have in place health and safety policies for their employees and be committed to good environmental, social and governance practices. Suppliers must not trade in the securities of the Group while in possession of confidential non-public information.

# CREDITORS' PAYMENT POLICY

The Group values its suppliers and is committed to safeguarding creditors' rights and acknowledges the importance of paying invoices, especially those of small businesses, in a timely manner. It is the Group's practice to agree terms with suppliers when entering into contracts. The Group negotiates with suppliers on an individual basis and meets its obligations accordingly.

# RISK MANAGEMENT

# STATEMENT OF RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL

The ComfortDelGro Group's risk management framework provides a systematic process for the Group and its Business Units to identify, review, mitigate and prioritise risks associated with its business operations. Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework is guided by internationally recognised standards, including the ISO 31000 Risk Management Standard and the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) Enterprise Risk Management Framework. This foundation enables a structured approach to identify, assess, monitor and mitigate dynamic risks that could impact our ability to achieve business objectives. The Audit and Risk Committee (ARC) and the Board, through their oversight role, review and approve the ERM Framework designed and implemented by Management and ensures that such framework is consistent with the Group's strategic goals and risk appetite, and is effectively implemented.

The Group is committed to enhancing shareholder value through sustainable and profitable growth, while ensuring a comprehensive approach to risk identification and mitigation. This commitment is underpinned by key principles that define our approach to enterprise risk management:

- Dynamic and Agile Risk Management: We adopt a continuous and iterative process tailored to the diverse nature of our businesses and operating environments. Regular identification, assessment, mitigation, and reporting of our risks ensure that we stay ahead of emerging challenges. Further details on our risk management approach can be found in the following sections.  
- Inculcate a Risk-Aware Culture: We promote risk awareness at all levels by integrating risk management into daily operations and setting the appropriate tone from the top. This alignment ensures employees understand and prioritise risk management as a core aspect of their roles.  
Continuous Education and Communication: Regular workshops, training sessions, and clear communications through various forums and newsletters foster a proactive, risk-informed culture throughout the Group.  
- Clear Ownership and Accountability: Ownership of risk management is established at all levels, empowering managers and employees to leverage their expertise while Senior Management provides strategic oversight.

These principles ensure that risk management is seamlessly integrated into decision-making processes, supporting the

Group's strategic objectives and fostering resilience in a dynamic business environment. Our Group's Internal Audit function plays a critical role in evaluating the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal controls. Findings from audits drive and lead to continuous improvement initiatives within our risk management practices.

# Risk Oversight & Governance Structure

ComfortDelGro's Board assumes ultimate responsibility for risk governance, providing oversight for the Group's approach to risk management. The Audit and Risk Committee (ARC) supports the Board by overseeing the Group's risk management framework and internal controls. External and Internal Auditors provide independent reviews of the risk management and internal control measures implemented by Management.

The Management Risk Committee (MRC), chaired by the Managing Director/Group Chief Executive Officer (MD/GCEO), is responsible for establishing and enforcing the Group's risk management and internal control systems. The MRC ensures robust systems and processes are in place to identify, manage, mitigate and monitor risks across the enterprise. Its members include the Heads of major business units and Corporate Group Chief Division Officers.

Key risks identified by the Group are presented to the ARC and the Board on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary. Supporting the MRC in implementing the Group's Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework is the Group Risk Office (GRO), headed by the Group Chief Risk Officer (GCRO). External and internal auditors provide independent reviews of both risk management and internal controls, complementing the efforts of management.

# BUSINESS ASSURANCE

- Responsible for setting up policy management, identifying, assessing, managing, mitigating and monitoring risks. They are also responsible for building a robust internal control environment and maintaining strong financial and operational governance within their daily operations  
- Comprises BU Heads, Department Heads, Managers and employees, who are responsible for incorporating risk-mitigating controls when designing their operational process and procedures

In 2024, ComfortDelGro enhanced its risk management framework by adopting Singapore's Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA)'s guidance on the "Three Lines of Defence Model." This framework ensures the integrity and effectiveness of our risk management processes while streamlining roles and responsibilities across the Group.

The Three Lines of Defence framework empowers employees at all levels to take ownership of their roles in risk management, fostering a cohesive and proactive risk-aware culture. By aligning responsibilities and enhancing collaboration, this model integrates risk management into daily operations, enabling the Group to address risks more effectively and adapt to a dynamic operating environment.

The First Line of Defence comprises business unit (BU) functions, which are accountable for managing business operations, policies, risks, and internal controls within their respective entities. Their key responsibilities include establishing and maintaining structures and processes to manage operations, risks, and ensure compliance with legal, regulatory, and ethical standards; developing policies and procedures to effectively monitor and manage risks; and detecting and addressing changes in the entity's risk profile in a timely manner.

BU Risk Leads support the First Line of Defence by providing oversight over risk management within the respective business units. Their key responsibilities include implementing and communicating the ERM strategies, frameworks, and risk management policies set by the Group Risk Office; ensuring that BU risks are adequately identified, assessed, managed, mitigated and monitored; and acting as internal "ambassadors" and knowledgeable resources for ERM, fostering a risk-aware culture within the BU.

The Second Line of Defence comprises group-level control functions, led by the Group Risk Office and other specialised functions such as Information Technology, Cybersecurity, Finance, Human Resource, and Legal. These functions provide expertise and oversight to support effective risk management activities across the Group. Key responsibilities include monitoring risk activities, ensuring alignment with Group-wide policies, providing specialised guidance on areas such as cybersecurity and regulatory compliance, and conducting analyses to assess the effectiveness of risk management and internal control frameworks.

BU Risk Lead, along with other management assurance roles, plays a crucial role in enforcing accountability and fostering collaboration between group-level functions and individual entities.

The Third Line of Defence is represented by the Group Internal Audit, which provides independent assurance on the adequacy and effectiveness of the Risk Management Framework and internal control systems. This line ensures that risk management processes and controls are robust, transparent, and aligned with the Group's strategic objectives.

The Board assumes ultimate responsibility for risk governance, providing oversight for the Group's approach to risk management. The Audit and Risk Committee (ARC) supports the Board by overseeing the Group's risk management framework and internal controls.

# Risk Culture

The Group is committed to fostering a robust risk management culture by promoting awareness, positive attitudes, and proactive behaviours toward risk. By continuously aligning with best practices and learning from experiences, we aim to enhance decision-making, operational resilience, and alignment with the organisation's strategic objectives.

The Group Risk Office plays a central role in cultivating a strong risk culture by fostering open communication with BU Risk Leads. These internal ambassadors actively update the Group Risk Office about risk activities within their respective business units (BUs) while also serve as key resources for employees on Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). This two-way engagement facilitates efficient information exchange among stakeholders, ensures alignment across the Group's risk management practices and fosters a risk-aware community with clear ownership and accountability at all levels.

The Management Risk Committee (MRC), which meets every quarter, reinforces the Group's risk culture by enabling senior management to communicate risk strategies and commitments clearly. This ensures a consistent 'tone from the top,' with senior management providing guidance that cascades throughout the organisation.

# RISK MANAGEMENT

To empower employees in their roles, the Group Risk Office and BU Risk Leads focus on building risk management capabilities through regular briefings, training sessions, and newsletters to promote awareness and skill development and risk orientation briefings for new employees to familiarise them with the Group's risk management processes, underscoring our commitment to compliance and integrity.

By fostering collaboration, accountability, and continuous learning, the Group strengthens its overall risk culture, ensuring it remains adaptable to evolving challenges while supporting its strategic objectives.

# TRAINING AND AWARENESS

We appraise our learning environment to achieve continuous improvement. We give training to all our employees on risk awareness and provide a platform for employees to raise their concerns

# OWNERSHIP & ACCOUNTABILITY

We advocate accountability and ownership of risks. We encourage our BUs and staff to be transparent and committed to managing the risks in their entities

# IMPLEMENTATION, COORDINATION & SUPPORT

The Management Risk Committee and the Group Risk Management regularly review, refresh, identify and manage its portfolio of risks, with support of the ARC and the Board

![](images/17da2b98b55db4e8e638080a877738c523846931d441e819dbbd09e41c0b1564.jpg)

# METHODOLOGY & FRAMEWORK

The Group has put in-place a risk management framework to manage risks at the Group and BU levels. Risks are regularly updated to reflect changes in the business environment and risk terrain

# MANAGEMENT & LEADERSHIP

We build a strong management team to identify current and potential risks. Our leadership sets the tone and ensures that a consistent message on risk management is cascaded across the Group

# Risk Management

Our ERM framework, aligned with ISO 31000:2018 Risk Management and the COSO Enterprise Risk Management Framework, provides a comprehensive structure for the Group's risk management practices, processes, and procedures. It defines clear roles and responsibilities while outlining key elements such as risk appetite, strategies, and other critical resources.

Our Risk Appetite Statements articulate and guide Management's risk strategies in pursuit of strategic objectives and business plans, enabling risk-based decision-making and the effective allocation of resources to manage the Group's key risks. Risks are identified by assessing their likelihood and impact, in line with the risk parameters set at the Group or Business Unit level. The identified risks are analysed for their possible risk drivers and potential consequences should the risk materialise. Risks are rated as Very High, High, Medium, or Low based on a 5x5 risk rating matrix at both residual and target levels. The overall risk rating is determined by the position of the risk on this matrix, which reflects the likelihood of occurrence and the severity of its potential consequences.

Tailored risk treatments and mitigation strategies are implemented, taking into account existing controls and action plans to effectively manage exposures. As part of this process, appropriate risk controls—comprising preventive, detective, and responsive measures—are identified and deployed to mitigate risks effectively. Management, in collaboration with risk owners, continuously monitors and reports on key risks through defined risk indicators, ensuring proactive risk management. Quarterly updates are provided to the Audit & Risk Committee to uphold oversight, transparency, and accountability in the Group's risk governance framework.

The Group Risk Office also actively monitors industry and organisational developments to ensure the Group's Risk Universe and Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework remain current. These are updated at least annually, or more frequently as needed, to incorporate the latest information relevant to our operations. The Risk Universe serves as a comprehensive guide to material risks, categorised into strategic, financial, operational, compliance, and technology domains. This resource is made accessible to all employees via the intranet and regularly promoted through briefings and employee programmes, and disseminated through Risk Leads to their respective BUs for easy reference

and adaptation to their specific operational needs.

Our risk management process integrates a top-down and bottom-up approach to ensure robust identification, prioritisation, and management of risks:

# Bottom-Up Approach

- Enhanced Employee Engagement: Regular risk awareness training and briefings empower employees to actively participate in risk identification. This fosters two-way communication, enabling employees to provide valuable feedback and insights to their BU Risk Leads.  
- Effective Communication: BU Risk Leads maintain regular communication with the Group Risk Office, providing timely updates on risk activities within their respective BUs. This regular communication ensures that the Group Risk Office has a clear understanding of emerging risks within the business units.  
- Risk Identification and Mitigation: BU-level Tier 1 risks are identified through annual risk workshops facilitated by BU Risk Leads. Group Risk Office consolidates these risks to create a comprehensive overview of the Group's risk landscape. These workshops also facilitate discussions on potential mitigation strategies and control measures.  
- Risk Prioritisation and Oversight: Consolidated risks are presented to the Management Risk Committee (MRC) to prioritise the Group's Tier 1 risks for active management and monitoring by senior management. These prioritised risks are then regularly updated and reported to the Audit and Risk Committee (ARC) by senior management.

# Top-Down Approach

Strategic Alignment: Prioritised Group Tier 1 risks are aligned with the Group's strategic objectives and presented to the Audit and Risk Committee (ARC) for review and endorsement by the Board.  
- Regular Reporting and Oversight: The Group regularly reports risk movements and key risk indicators to the ARC on a quarterly basis to ensure effective oversight.  
- Risk Appetite and Tolerance: The ARC monitors the management of Group Tier 1 risks, ensuring they remain within the Board's defined risk appetite and tolerance levels.

# RISK MANAGEMENT

# Risk Appetite

The Board, with support from the ARC, endorses the Group's risk appetite statements and risk tolerance limits for the Group's key risks. These guide management in ensuring that appropriate levels of control are in place to manage the risks, while allowing business operations to continue to run.

Operating within the risk appetite framework reflects ComfortDelGro's dedication to providing value to shareholders through sustainable growth across strategic, operational, technological, and financial domains, while upholding legal and regulatory compliance. The Group is dedicated to conducting its affairs with integrity and adhering to its values, actively managing measured risks, and concurrently pursuing opportunities for business expansion.

# Group Key Risks

# Business Strategy

At ComfortDelGro, we are firmly committed to executing our strategic objectives, which are key to achieving sustainable and profitable growth that delivers long-term value to our shareholders. We aim to maintain our market leadership while pursuing impactful development across various areas. We continue to expand our footprints in existing markets, venture into adjacent business sectors, grow our global rail operations, and enhance our future mobility capabilities, all while aligning with global megatrends. Our strategy is focused not only on growth but also on strengthening ComfortDelGro's resilience in the face of evolving market dynamics, ensuring we are well-positioned for the future.

Our key mitigation actions include:

- Board Commitment and Oversight: The Board, supported by the Strategy and Investment Committee (SIC), plays a vital role in overseeing key investments, mergers, acquisitions and the execution of the Group's corporate strategy. The SIC is instrumental in ensuring that our strategic initiatives align with the Group's long-term objectives and within the risk appetite set by the Board. It also ensures that these initiatives meet stakeholder expectations and that risk tolerance levels are embedded within the Group's decision-making framework. We leverage a range of key risk indicators to monitor risks associated with our business strategy. These enable the early identification of potential risks, allowing for timely interventions and recalibrations where necessary.

- Proactive Risk Mitigation for Strategic Alignment:

The Group Strategy under our Corporate Development Division takes a proactive approach in evaluating risks related to all strategic business decisions and major investments. Prior to approval from the Board Strategy and Investment Committee, we ensure that adequate assessments are conducted for strategic alignment and ensure that we work within the Group's risk appetite.

- Enhanced Investment Evaluation Process: All investment proposals undergo an approval process that includes due diligence carried out by internal and/or external experts. This ensures that each investment is carefully evaluated, aligned with our strategic goals, and supports informed decision-making while mitigating risks associated with new ventures.

# Competition

The Group recognises the heightened risk of increased competition risk within the rapidly-evolving mobility sector. To maintain our competitive edge, ComfortDelGro is committed to adapting and evolving our operations and embracing clean energy solutions as part of our strategy to drive sustainability and innovation. We proactively address this challenge by continuously improving our quality of operations, embracing technological advancements, expanding service offerings, and optimising operational efficiency to ensure sustained growth and profitability.

Our key mitigation actions include:

# Strategic Partnerships and Collaborations:

ComfortDelGro actively pursues partnerships and collaborations to diversify our product and service offerings and embrace innovation. By collaborating with key players, we enhance our technological capabilities, optimise operational efficiency, and reduce development costs. These strategic partnerships enable us to strengthen our competitive position by developing combined offers drawing on the complementary skills of ComfortDelGro and the selected partner in the context of the tender opportunity that we are targeting, including in new geographies.

# Understanding the Impacts of Climate-Related Risks

Based on our climate risk screening, a scenario analysis was conducted based on relevant financial and environmental data and business-related information, to assess the most pertinent physical (chronic and acute) and transition climate risks applicable to our operations. The results from the screening exercise and the climate scenario analysis provided us with a targeted analysis of the material risks and opportunities presented by climate change, enabling us to consider the potential impacts on ComfortDelGro's businesses, strategy and financial planning.

The risks and opportunities are prioritised on their financial impact to our asset portfolios across the Group. In the assessment of the nature, likelihood, and magnitude resulting from those risks and opportunities, we considered both quantitative and qualitative factors. This led to the identification of key physical risks such as higher mean temperatures, floods and storms may lead to increased operational costs, heat stress, reduced staff productivity, business interruptions and revenue impacts. While transition risks and opportunities may result in higher operational costs, they may also present greater financial opportunities arising from the transition towards low-carbon transport.

Our key mitigation actions include:

Identifying and assessing our physical and transition risks and opportunities presented by climate change allows ComfortDelGro to identify areas for mitigation while capitalising on the opportunities arising from the changing environment. This reduces uncertainty in our business operations and mitigates potential adverse impacts.

Mitigation through Operations  
We are actively transitioning our fleet to more efficient and cleaner vehicles, targeting a significant reduction in our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This directly supports our carbon reduction targets, validated by the Science Based Targets Initiative ("SBTi"). We also mitigate environmental risks through operational efficiencies such as energy audits, the adoption of renewable energy, and responsible resource management (energy, fuel, and water), while acknowledging our potential impact on nature and biodiversity.  
- We proactively manage physical climate risks through review of our business continuity plans ("BCP"). Recognising the unique climate risks at each location, every business unit, depot and office has a tailored BCP to mitigate potential disruptions and catastrophic losses to our operations, personnel, information databases and other assets. These plans incorporate measures such as increased vehicle maintenance frequency and early warning systems to enhance the resilience of our operations.  
- Mitigation through Supply Chain Collaborations

We are committed to driving sustainability throughout our supply chain, working closely with our partners, suppliers, and contractors to promote responsible practices and continuously refine our supply chain policies and evaluation processes. These efforts ensure alignment with stakeholder expectations and global developments, focusing on responsible resource consumption, avoiding deforestation and biodiversity loss, and supporting the transition to cleaner energy.

# Mitigation through Investment in Sustainable Solutions

We proactively manage our risks relating to climate and the evolving transportation landscape through targeted investments and partnership as we recognise that these investments are also a significant climate opportunity and a key pillar of our decarbonisation strategy. ComfortDelGro supports innovation in green transportation and emerging mobilities technologies, spanning battery recycling and automotive vehicles, to electrification infrastructure development. Through these investments, we continue to contribute to developing a sustainable transport future, prioritising cleaner and more efficient mobility. Data-driven insights from technology and digital solutions also enable us to monitor and manage our environmental impact, identifying and mitigating operational and reputational risks across our business.

We are dedicated to continuously improving how we manage and report climate - related risks and opportunities for our organisation, employees and customers. As the global economy shifts towards sustainable solutions, we will leverage opportunities arising from advancements in greener mobility technology. Our climate scenario analysis will continue to be refined and expanded, incorporating available data to quantify climate-related risks and opportunities.

More details on our climate-related risk and opportunities can be found in the ComfortDelGro Sustainability Report 2024.

# Workplace Safety and Health

We are committed to providing a safe, healthy and secure environment for all our stakeholders across regions. The safety and well-being of our people remain our top priority. We strive to foster and uphold a positive work culture while maintaining a safe workplace. Our Board of Directors and CEOs, as well as Business Unit Heads and managers, led by example in prioritising safety, health, and welfare in the workplace, and are equipped with the necessary resources to achieve safe outcomes.

Our Lost Time Injury Rate (LTIR) has shown continuous improvement year-on-year. In 2024, we reduced our LTIR by 38 percent to 2.49 incidents per 1,000,000 hours worked, compared to 4.03 in 2023. Our workforce is the cornerstone of our operations, and prioritising their health and safety is our top focus.

Our key mitigating actions include:

# - Mitigation through Policy Implementation

In 2024, we reviewed our existing workplace safety and health-related policies across our businesses and published our Group-wide Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Policy, aligned with ISO 45001:2018 and other international standards. The policy, covering all employees, vendors, contractors, and operators, sets a global standard across all our operations, and outlines management's commitment to workplace safety and health. As part of our ongoing efforts, we regularly conduct risk assessments to identify potential workplace hazards and implement targeted control measures to mitigate these risks effectively. More of our Business Units are also achieving ISO 45001 certification or being certified as a BizSAFE Partner, further reinforcing our commitment to a systematic and risk-based approach to workplace safety.

In Australia, the team released an updated Drug and Alcohol Policy in June 2024, endorsed by the Group. This update is part of a wider initiative to improve workplace safety, ensure compliance with safety standards, and foster a safer work environment.

# - Mitigation through Continuous Training and Workshops

In 2024, ComfortDelGro implemented a wide range of safety initiatives across our global operations to prioritise the health and safety of our workforce. These efforts include safety workshops, risk assessments, and safety committees, alongside targeted programmes to address specific hazards like vehicle safety and EV-related risks. Efforts are also focused on enhancing training and awareness on emergency procedures, hazard mitigation, and workplace safety best practices. Our teams conduct regular safety drills, providing safety gear and ensuring compliance with local safety standards. Through these initiatives, we strive to foster a proactive safety culture, improve response times during emergencies, and continuously work towards reducing workplace incidents and enhancing employee well-being.

To enhance and build a stronger safety culture, WSH leads from all the business units meet regularly as part of the WSH Community of Practice to share high-profile and serious incidents/accidents and mitigation efforts. A monthly WSH incident sharing report is circulated to

# RISK MANAGEMENT

all the WSH leads, in addition to monthly monitoring of Loss Time Injury Rates (LTIR), serious incidents/accidents and fatalities. These metrics are also reported monthly to group management and quarterly to the Board.

# Mitigation through Technologies

To enhance safety and reduce operational risks, various technological innovations and initiatives have been implemented across our operations globally. These mitigation actions integrate advanced technologies and safety systems to improve awareness and prevent incidents, providing a safe environment for our stakeholders.

In Singapore, safety initiatives focus on leveraging technology and proactive safety management. For our public buses, these include the implementation of 360-degree collision warning systems with AI analytics for real-time alerts, high-definition digital mirrors to reduce glare and blind spots, and mixed reality stimulators for training and response improvement. Regular safety briefings, safety campaigns, and incident analysis further enhance safety awareness and risk mitigation across the workforce.

Australia's safety efforts focus on the reduction of overexertion and slips, trips, and falls through ergonomic materials and tools. Bus driver-focused initiatives include the development of training videos, ergonomic exercise guides, and pocket-sized manuals. Additionally, the introduction of "Powerload" stretchers in National Patient Transport reduces manual handling risks, supporting safer and more efficient operations.

# Mitigation through Strategic Partnerships

ComfortDelGro is committed to enhancing safety and well-being through strategic partnerships that drive innovative solutions. By collaborating with organisations such as the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), Singapore Road Safety Council (SRSC) and Transport for London (TfL), we have introduced initiatives across our global operations, including AED-equipped buses, fatigue detection systems, and advanced monitoring technologies. These partnerships help us strengthen community safety, improve driver health, reduce accidents, and create a safer environment for both passengers and employees. Through these collaborative efforts, we continue to integrate cutting-edge safety measures, ensuring effective risk mitigation across our operations.

Internally, our group WSH Community of Practice leads ("WSH CoP Leads") from all local and overseas BUs meets every quarter. In our quarterly get-together session, we share changes to any policy, year-to-date WSH Statistics, good safety practices and initiatives among BUs, internal or external key safety audit findings, sharing of any fatality and high-consequence incident cases and other safety-related matters. Our WSH CoP Leads meet regularly to communicate and share safety knowledge, safety cases and exchange of ideas, learning from each other.

The Group is committed to continuously enhancing our approach to managing workplace safety and health risks for our employees and stakeholders. Our ongoing efforts, reflected in the improvement of our Lost Time Injury Rate and implementation of advanced safety measures, contribute to ensuring a safer and healthier environment for our employees, contractors, and the communities we serve.

# INTERNAL CONTROL

As part of regular updates, the Group Risk Office has revised our risk-based Minimum Acceptable Controls (MAC) to maintain their relevance and effectiveness in strengthening our internal control framework. The MAC sets baseline standards across business units, promoting consistency in the Group's control environment. Covering key areas such as Finance, Human Resources, and Workplace Health and Safety, the framework requires business units to conduct annual reviews and assessments of their compliance, reinforcing a strong and resilient internal control structure. The Group Risk Office will review and assess all submissions to maintain oversight of the MAC compliance status.

In addition to the MAC assessment, all Business Unit Heads will submit an annual written management assurance to the Managing Director/ Group Chief Executive Officer through the Group Risk Office. This assurance covers key areas such as Financial Reporting & External Audit Process, Material Disclosure Process, Regulatory & Compliance Process, Risk Management Process, and Internal Control Process.

The Group Risk Office collaborates closely with the Group Internal Audit team to ensure that any control gaps identified during audits are promptly addressed and rectified across business units. This proactive oversight, coupled with ongoing assessments by Internal Audit, ensures that the control environment remains aligned with the Group's standards.

# AUDIT PROCESS

The Internal and External Auditors conduct reviews based on their audit plans to evaluate the adequacy of internal controls in place. A risk-based approach is used for the annual internal audit plan, covering the entire auditable universe of the Group. Throughout their audits, both the Internal and External Auditors will report any material deficiencies, non-compliance, weaknesses, or significant risk events to Management and the ARC. They will also recommend mitigating measures and treatment plans. Audit recommendations are closely followed up as part of the Group's ongoing review of its internal controls, with the implementation status reported to the ARC.

The Group Internal Audit function is independent of the activities it audits and has unrestricted access to the ARC, the Board, and Management. In line with best practices, Group Internal Audit operates a Quality Assurance and Improvement Programme (QAIP) that aligns with international auditing standards. The QAIP is conducted every five years to ensure that the Internal Audit function meets or exceeds the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) Standards in all key areas. The last QAIP was conducted by Protiviti in 2023.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF COMFORTDELGRO CORPORATION LIMITED

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of ComfortDelGro Corporation Limited (the "Company") and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Group"), which comprise the Statements of financial position of the Group and the Company as at 31 December 2024, the statements of changes in equity of the Group and the Company and the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income and consolidated cash flow statement of the Group for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including material accounting policy information.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Group, and the Statements of financial position and the statement of changes in equity of the Company are properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1967 (the "Act") and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) ("SFRS(I)s") so as to give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group and the financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2024 and of the consolidated financial performance, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group and changes in equity of the Company for the year ended on that date.

# Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing ("SSAs"). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority ("ACRA") Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities ("ACRA Code") together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Singapore, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ACRA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

# Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.

We have fulfilled our responsibilities described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying financial statements.

# Valuation of assets, liabilities and goodwill from business combinations

During the year, the Group entered into various acquisitions as disclosed in Note 41. The Group has determined these acquisitions to be business combinations for which the purchase price is to be allocated among acquired assets and liabilities, including intangible assets and contingent liabilities arising from the acquisitions at their respective fair values and the resultant goodwill. Independent professional valuers were engaged by the Group to assist in performing purchase price allocation exercise that includes but not limited to, determining fair valuation of acquired assets and liabilities, identification and valuation of intangible assets. The identification of such assets and liabilities, including intangible assets and contingent liabilities and their respective measurement at fair value are inherently judgemental, thus we considered this to be a key audit matter.

We have obtained the valuation reports prepared by independent valuers and the Group for the assets and liabilities acquired through business combinations. We, together with our valuation specialists, assessed the competence and capabilities of the valuers and objectivity of the valuers, and assessed the reasonableness of their conclusions having regard to the key assumptions including forecast cash flows focusing on revenues and earnings before interest and tax ('EBIT'), appropriateness of discount and growth rates and cross-checking valuation assumptions against comparable companies, whilst considering the risk of management bias and also the reasonableness of the residual goodwill and the consideration given.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF COMFORTDELGRO CORPORATION LIMITED

Key Audit Matters (cont'd)

# Impairment assessment of vehicles, premises and equipment, intangible assets, goodwill and investment in subsidiaries

The Group and Company have a large number of vehicles, premises and equipment, intangible assets with either indefinite or definite useful lives, goodwill and investment in subsidiaries whose carrying amounts are material and are disclosed in Notes 13, 14, 15 and 9 to the financial statements, respectively. The carrying values of these non-financial assets are either tested individually or allocated to the respective cash generating units ("CGUs") for impairment assessment. Management is required to perform impairment assessments on CGUs with allocated goodwill and or intangible assets with indefinite useful lives (i.e., taxi licences) annually or when an indicator of impairment is identified. For other non-financial assets, the impairment assessment is performed when an indicator of impairment is identified at the reporting date. The impairment assessments require determination of the recoverable amount of the assets based on the higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal that are determined by applying valuation techniques such as the discounted cash flow method. The disclosures on the impairment assessments are made in Note 3 to the financial statements.

The estimates of the assets' recoverable amount involve the use of Management's assumptions, forecasts of future cash flows, future economic and market conditions relevant to the assets, and determination of appropriate discount rates. These and the identification of impairment indicators involve significant Management judgement and estimation uncertainty, including but not limited to economic outlook and the effects of changes in the environment. Consequently, we have considered this to be a key audit matter.

As part of our audit, we reviewed Management's identification of impairment indicators for the non-financial assets and their process and basis of determining recoverable amount of the relevant assets. We obtained the discounted cash flow computations based on financial and operating budgets prepared and approved by Management and evaluated the reasonableness of key assumptions and inputs used, including but not limited to profit margins, growth and discount rates by comparing to historical information, external market data and observed trends. We evaluated the robustness of management's budgeting process by comparing the actual results to previously forecasted results and performed sensitivity analyses on key assumptions for alternative reasonably possible scenarios. We also assessed the appropriateness of discount rates that are based on weighted average cost of capital with the assistance of our internal valuation specialist who relied on external data relevant to the geographical location of each asset. We also reviewed the adequacy of the disclosures in relation to the Group and Company's vehicles, premises and equipment, intangible assets, goodwill and investment in subsidiaries provided in aforementioned notes to the financial statements.

# Accounting for Bus contracts with public transport regulators

The Group's Public Transport Services segment has entered into contracts with public transport regulators (the "Grantors") in various markets where the Group operates bus assets and provide public bus services (the "Bus contracts"). As part of determining the appropriate accounting treatments for these Bus contracts, Management is required to determine whether these public-to-private arrangements are within the scope of SFRS(I) Interpretation ("INT") 12 Service Concession Arrangements and how the bus assets owned or leased by the Group are recognised in the financial statements. The applicability of SFRS(I) INT 12 is based on an assessment of whether the Grantors have both the control over the services to be provided using the bus assets and the residual interests at the end of the contract (the "Control test"). The Control test determines the Group's accounting treatment of the bus assets and the related revenue, income and expenses. The evaluation of the Management's assessment on accounting treatments for the Group's Bus contracts involved significant judgement. Accordingly, we have identified the accounting for Bus contracts with public transport regulators as a key audit matter.

As part of our audit, we reviewed and discussed with Management the key contractual terms, facts and circumstances of a representative sample of the Group's existing Bus contracts to evaluate the appropriateness of the accounting treatments applied, including but not limited to the applicability of SFRS(I) INT 12 and the treatment of bus assets owned or leased by the Group.

In addition to the aforementioned audit procedures, we obtained an understanding of Management's process of reviewing and identifying the key contractual terms, facts and circumstances of the Group's Bus contracts. We obtained and reviewed Management's assessment of the accounting treatments of the Group's Bus contracts based on the requirements of the relevant SFRS(I) standards and interpretations, the economic characteristics of the key contractual rights and obligations of the Grantors and the Group under the Bus contracts. We held discussions to understand and challenge Management's assumptions and judgements involved in evaluating each Bus contract and reviewed relevant supporting documents of the Bus contracts.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF COMFORTDELGRO CORPORATION LIMITED

Key Audit Matters (cont'd)

# Recognition and measurement of provision for accident claims

The Group recognises provision for accident claims arising from its transportation business when it has a present obligation (legal or constructive) that would result in an expected settlement that can be reliably estimated. The carrying amount of the provision for accident claims are disclosed in Note 22 to the financial statements.

Management exercises significant judgements in determining the estimated amounts required to settle the obligations, which is inherently uncertain in both timing and amounts. Management considers the probability and amount of the expected settlement claims based on current available information such as claims history and payment trends. The key assumptions and estimates used by Management are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. Given the significant Management judgement and estimation uncertainty involved, we have considered this to be a key audit matter.

As part of our audit, we reviewed Management's process of identifying accident claims that meet the recognition criteria and obtained Management's computation, assumptions and estimates used for the measurement of the provision. We evaluated the reasonableness of key assumptions and estimates used by Management to measure the provision, including reviewing the number of claims lodged, recent settlements, third party settlement data and accident claims statistics. We reviewed the adequacy and overall reasonableness of the provision by understanding reasons for any significant variances and corroborating them with publicly available information. We also reviewed the disclosures in relation to the Group's provision for accident claims provided in aforementioned notes to the financial statements.

# Other Information

Management is responsible for other information. Other information consists of the information included in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

We obtained the Directors' Statement prior to the date of our auditor's report, and we expect to obtain the remaining other information included in the annual report after the date of our auditor's report.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. If, based on the work we have performed on the other information obtained prior to the date of the auditor's report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of Management and Directors for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the provisions of the Act and SFRS(I), and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The directors' responsibilities include overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

# TO THE MEMBERS OF COMFORTDELGRO CORPORATION LIMITED

# Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.  
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.  
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.  
Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.  
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.  
Plan and perform the group audit to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business units within the group as a basis for forming an opinion on the group financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and review of the audit work performed for purposes of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024

# 1. CORPORATE INFORMATION

The Company (Registration No. 200300002K) is incorporated in the Republic of Singapore with its registered office and principal place of business at 205 Braddell Road, Singapore 579701. The Company is listed on the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited.

The principal activities of the Company are those of investment holding and the provision of management and shared services. The principal activities of the subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are described in Note 40.

The Financial Statements are expressed in Singapore dollars and all values are expressed in million (\(mil) except when otherwise indicated.

The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group for the financial year ended 31 December 2024 and the Statement of Financial Position and Statement of Changes in Equity of the Company as at 31 December 2024 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 27 February 2025.

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION

# Basis of accounting

The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost basis, except as disclosed in the accounting policies below and are drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Singapore Companies Act 1967 and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) ("SFRS(I)").

Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability which market participants would take into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these Consolidated Financial Statements is determined on such a basis, except for share-based payment transactions that are within the scope of SFRS(I) 2, leasing transactions that are within the scope of SFRS(I) 16, and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as net realisable value in SFRS(I) 1-2 Inventories or value in use in SFRS(I) 1-36.

# Adoption of New and Revised Financial Standards

On 1 January 2024, the Group and the Company adopted all the new and revised SFRS(I) pronouncements that are relevant to its operations. The adoption of these new/revised SFRS(I) pronouncements does not result in changes to the Group's and the Company's accounting policies and has no material effect on the amounts reported for the current or prior years.

# New/Revised standards and improvements to the standards not yet adopted

The Group has not applied the following accounting standards that are relevant to the Group and have been issued as at the end of the reporting period but not yet effective:

Amendments to SFRS(I) 9 and SFRS(I) 7 Amendments to the Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments (1)  
Annual Improvements to SFRS(I)s - Volume 11 (1)  
- SFRS(I) 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements (2)  
- SFRS(I) 19 Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures (2)  
Amendments to SFRS(I) 10 and SFRS(I) 1-28 Sales or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture (3)

(1) Applies to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2026.  
(2) Applies to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027  
(3) Adoption date to be determined

Management anticipates that the adoption of the above SFRS(I) pronouncements in future periods is not expected to have a material impact on the Financial Statements in the period of their initial adoption.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (cont'd)

# Basis of consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements incorporate the Financial Statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company and its subsidiaries. Control is achieved when the Company:

Has power over the investee;  
Is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and  
- Has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.

The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above.

Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Company loses control of the subsidiary. Specifically, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Group Income Statement and Group Comprehensive Income Statement from the date the Company gains control until the date when the Company ceases to control the subsidiary.

Profit or Loss and each component of Other Comprehensive Income are attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-controlling interests. Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.

When necessary, adjustments are made to the Financial Statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies in line with those consistently used by the Group.

Changes in the Group's ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in the Group losing control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the Group's interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to owners of the Company

All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.

Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group's equity therein. Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination (see below) and the non-controlling interests' share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. Losses are attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.

In the Statement of Financial Position of the Company, investments in subsidiaries and associates are carried at cost less any impairment in net recoverable value that has been recognised in Profit or Loss.

# Business combinations

The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of acquisition, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group to the former owners of the acquiree in exchange for control of the acquiree. The acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under SFRS(I) 3 Business Combinations are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date except for deferred tax assets or liabilities which are recognised and measured in accordance with SFRS(I) 1-12 Income Taxes. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in Profit or Loss as incurred.

The interest of the non-controlling shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the non-controlling interest's proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.

If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period (see below), or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.

# FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (cont'd)

Business combinations (cont'd)

The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and is subject to a maximum of one year from acquisition date.

# Financial instruments

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group's Statement of Financial Position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through Profit or Loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in Profit or Loss.

# Financial assets

All financial assets are recognised and de-recognised on a trade date basis where the purchase or sale of financial assets is under a contract whose terms require delivery of assets within the time frame established by the market concerned.

All recognised financial assets are subsequently measured in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value, depending on the classification of the financial assets.

Classification of financial assets

Debt instruments that meet the following conditions are subsequently measured at amortised cost less impairment loss:

- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and  
the contractual terms of the instrument give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

Investments in debt instruments that meet both the following conditions are subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income ("FVTOCI"):

- the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and  
- the contractual terms of the instrument give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

All other financial assets are subsequently measured at value through Profit or Loss ("FVTPL").

Amortised cost and effective interest method

The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a debt instrument and of allocating interest income over the relevant period.

The amortised cost of a financial asset is the amount at which the financial asset is measured at initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount, adjusted for any loss allowance.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (cont'd)

Financial assets (cont'd)

Debt instruments classified as at FVTOCI

Investments in debt instruments at FVTOCI are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs. Subsequently, any gains or losses on such a financial asset are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income ("OCI"), except for impairment gains or losses and foreign exchange gains and losses until the financial asset is derecognised. When the financial asset is derecognised the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to Profit or Loss for the period.

Interest income is recognised in Profit or Loss and is included in the "Investments income" line item in Profit or Loss.

Equity instruments designated at FVTOCI

On initial recognition, the Group can make an irrevocable election (on an instrument-by-instrument basis) to designate investments in equity instruments as FVTOCI. Designation at FVTOCI is not permitted if the equity instrument is held for trading.

Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Subsequently, they are measured at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value including any foreign exchange difference are recognised in OCI. Such equity investments are not subject to impairment requirements. The amounts recognised in OCI are not subsequently reclassified to Profit or Loss on disposal of the equity instruments.

Dividends on these investments in equity instruments are recognised in Profit or Loss when the Group's right to receive the dividends is established, unless the dividends clearly represent a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Dividends are included in the "Investments income" line item in Profit or Loss.

Impairment of financial assets

The Group recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses ("ECL") on investments in debt instruments that are measured at amortised cost or at FVTOCI. No impairment loss is recognised for investments in equity instruments. The amount of ECL is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the respective financial instrument.

The Group applies the simplified approach permitted by SFRS(I) 9 for trade receivables. The ECL on these financial assets are estimated based on the Group's historical credit loss experience, adjusted for factors that are specific to the debtors as well as current and forecast general economic conditions at the reporting date.

To assess whether there is a significant increase in credit risk, the Group compares the risk of a default occurring on the asset as at the reporting date with the rate of default as at the date of initial recognition. It considers available reasonable and supportive forward-looking information, where relevant.

A default on a financial asset is when the counterparty fails to make contractual payments within a specific period after the credit period granted.

A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of that financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired include taking into consideration observable data about the significant financial difficulty of the issuer or the borrower; a breach of contract, such as a default or past due event; it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation.

Where receivables have been written off, the Group continues to recover the receivables due. Where recoveries are made, these are recognised in Profit or Loss.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (cont'd)

Financial assets (cont'd)

Derecognition of financial assets

The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another party.

On derecognition of a financial asset measured at amortised cost, the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable is recognised in Profit or Loss. In addition, on derecognition of an investment in a debt instrument classified as at FVTOCI, the cumulative gain or loss previously accumulated in the Investment Revaluation Reserve is reclassified to Profit or Loss. In contrast, on derecognition of an investment in equity instrument which the group has elected on initial recognition to measure at FVTOCI, the cumulative gain or loss previously accumulated in the Investment Revaluation Reserve is not reclassified to Profit or Loss, but is transferred to Retained Earnings.

# Financial liabilities and equity instruments

Classification as debt or equity

Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.

Equity instruments

An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

Borrowings

Interest-bearing loans are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised in Profit or Loss over the term of the borrowings.

Trade and other payables

Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.

Derecognition of financial liabilities

The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group's obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised and the consideration paid and payable, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in Profit or Loss.

# Hedging instruments and hedge accounting

The Group uses hedging instruments to manage its exposure to fuel price fluctuation, interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks. The use of hedging instruments is governed by the Group's policies which provide written principles on the use of financial instruments consistent with the Group's risk management strategy (see Note 36).

Hedging instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the contract date, and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting year. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in Profit or Loss immediately unless the hedging instrument is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in Profit or Loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. The Group designates its hedging instruments as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (cont'd)

Hedging instruments and hedge accounting (cont'd)

Hedging instruments are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. The fair value of hedging instrument is classified as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the maturity of the hedge relationship exceeds 12 months and as a current asset or current liability if the maturity of the hedge relationship is within 12 months.

At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item, along with its risk management objective and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, which is when the hedging relationships meet all of the following hedge effectiveness requirements:

there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument;  
the effect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from that economic relationship; and  
- the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the group actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the entity actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item.

The Group designates any interest rate swap for hedging of interest rate risk arising from borrowings as cash flow hedges. Hedges of both foreign currency risk and fuel price risk for future purchases of goods are designated as cash flow hedges.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.

Note 36(c) contains details of the fair values of the hedging instruments.

# Fair value hedge

Changes in the fair value of hedging instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in Profit or Loss immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged item that are attributable to the hedged risk.

# Cash flow hedge

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of hedging instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in OCI. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in Profit or Loss. Amounts recognised in OCI are taken to Profit or Loss when the hedged item is realised.

# Leases

# The Group as lessor

The Group enters into lease agreements as a lessor with respect to its properties and motor vehicles.

Leases for which the Group is a lessor are classified as finance or operating leases. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for the head lease and the sublease as two separate contracts. The sublease is classified as a finance or operating lease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease.

Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (cont'd)

Leases (cont'd)

The Group as lessor (cont'd)

Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recognised as receivables at the amount of the Group's net investment in the leases. Finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the Group's net investment outstanding in respect of the leases.

When a contract includes lease and non-lease components, the Group applies SFRS(I) 15 Revenue to allocate the consideration under the contract to each component.

The Group as lessee

The Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease, at inception of the contract. The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease arrangements in which it is the lessee, except for short-term leases (defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low value assets. For these leases, the Group recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased assets are consumed.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted by using the rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lessee.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise:

fixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives;  
variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the commencement date;  
the amount expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;  
the exercise price of purchase options, if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the options; and  
payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the exercise of an option to terminate the lease.

The lease liability is subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability (using the effective interest method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made.

The lease liability is presented as a separate line in the Statements of Financial Position.

The Group remeasures the lease liability (and makes a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset) whenever:

- the lease term has changed or there is a significant event or change in circumstances resulting in a change in the assessment of exercise of a purchase option, in which case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate; or  
the lease payments change due to changes in an index or rate or a change in expected payment under a guaranteed residual value, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using the initial discount rate (unless the lease payments change is due to a change in a floating interest rate, in which case a revised discount rate is used); or  
- a lease contract is modified and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate at the effective date of the modification.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (cont'd)

Leases (cont'd)

The Group as lessee (cont'd)

The right-of-use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments made at or before the commencement day, less any lease incentives received and any initial direct costs. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

Whenever the Group incurs an obligation for costs to dismantle and remove a leased asset, restore the site on which it is located or restore the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease, a provision is recognised and measured under SFRS(I) 1-37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets. The costs are included in the related right-of-use asset, unless those costs are incurred to produce inventories.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter period of lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. If a lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group expects to exercise a purchase option, the related right-of-use asset is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset. The depreciation starts at the commencement date of the lease.

The right-of-use assets are presented within vehicles, premises and equipment in the Statements of Financial Position.

The Group applies SFRS(I) 1-36 to determine whether a right-of-use asset is impaired and accounts for any identified impairment loss.

Variable rents that do not depend on an index or rate are not included in the measurement of the lease liability and the right-of-use asset. The related payments are recognised as an expense in the period in which the event or condition that triggers those payments occurs and are included in the line 'Other operating costs' in the Group Income Statement.

As a practical expedient, SFRS(I) 16 permits a lessee not to separate non-lease components, and instead account for any lease and associated non-lease components as a single arrangement. The Group has not used this practical expedient. For contracts that contain a lease component and one or more additional lease or non-lease components, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of the relative stand-alone price of the lease component and the aggregate stand-alone price of the non-lease components.

# Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises cost of purchase and those costs that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is calculated using the weighted average and first-in first-out method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.

# Vehicles, premises and equipment

Vehicles, premises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.

Capital projects in progress comprising development and construction costs incurred during the period of construction are carried at cost, less any recognised provision for impairment. Depreciation on these assets, on the same basis as other vehicles, premises and equipment, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (cont'd)

**Vehicles, premises and equipment (cont'd)**

Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of the assets, other than freehold land and capital projects in progress, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Number of years</td></tr><tr><td>Buses</td><td>12 to 20</td></tr><tr><td>Leasehold land and buildings</td><td>Over the remaining lease period</td></tr><tr><td>Freehold buildings</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td>Taxis, motor vehicles for rental and ambulances</td><td>5 to 15</td></tr><tr><td>Computers and automated equipment</td><td>3 to 5</td></tr><tr><td>Workshop machinery, tools and equipment:</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>- General workshop machinery, tools and equipment</td><td>3 to 10</td></tr><tr><td>- Specialised inspection and testing equipment</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Motor vehicles:</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>- Motorcycles</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>- Other motor vehicles</td><td>5 to 10</td></tr><tr><td>Furniture, fittings and equipment</td><td>5 to 7</td></tr></table>

The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at each year end, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.

On disposal of an item of vehicles, premises and equipment, the difference between the sales proceeds and its carrying amount is recognised in Profit or Loss.

Fully depreciated vehicles, premises and equipment still in use are retained in the Financial Statements.

# Assets held for sale

Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification. When the Group is committed to a sale plan involving loss of control of a subsidiary, all of the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary are classified as held for sale when the criteria described above are met, regardless of whether the Group will retain a non-controlling interest in its former subsidiary after the sale. Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.

# Joint-arrangements

A joint arrangement is a contractual arrangement whereby two or more parties have joint control. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. To the extent the joint arrangement provides the Group with rights to the net assets of the arrangement, the arrangement is a joint venture.

# Joint-ventures

The Group recognises its interest in a joint venture as an investment and accounts for the investment using the equity method.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (cont'd)

# Associates

An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.

The Group accounts for its investments in associates and joint ventures using the equity method from the date on which it becomes an associate or joint venture.

The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these Consolidated Financial Statements using the equity method of accounting, except when the investment, or a portion thereof, is classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for in accordance with SFRS(I) 5. Under the equity method, an investment in an associate is initially recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group's share of the Profit or Loss and OCI of the associate. When the Group's share of losses of an associate exceeds the Group's interest in that associate (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group's net investment in the associate), the Group discontinues recognising its share of further losses. Additional losses are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.

Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the associate recognised at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment and is assessed for impairment as part of the investment. Any excess of the Group's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost of acquisition, after reassessment, is recognised immediately in Profit or Loss.

Where a Group entity transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the relevant associate.

# Intangible assets

Intangible assets acquired separately

Taxi licences and rights under contract acquired separately are recorded at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Taxi licences and rights under contract with finite useful lives are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each annual reporting year, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis. Taxi licences with indefinite useful lives are not amortised. Each period, the useful lives of such assets are reviewed to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life assessment for the asset. Such assets are tested for impairment in accordance with the policy below.

Intangible assets acquired in a business combination

Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are identified and recognised separately from goodwill where they satisfy the definition of an intangible asset and their fair values can be measured reliably. The cost of such intangible assets is their fair value at the acquisition date.

Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets acquired separately.

Software development costs

Research costs are recognised as an expense when incurred. Costs directly attributable to the development of software are capitalised as intangible assets only when technical feasibility of the project is demonstrated, the Group has an intention and ability to complete and use the software and the costs can be measured reliably. Such costs include purchases of materials and services and payroll-related costs of employees directly involved in the project.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (cont'd)

# Goodwill

Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group's interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the subsidiary recognised at the date of acquisition. If, after reassessment, the Group's interest in the net fair value of the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the acquisition, the excess is recognised immediately in Profit or Loss.

Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any provision for impairment.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group's cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the provision for impairment is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. A provision for impairment recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.

On divestment of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the Profit or Loss on divestment.

# Impairment of non-financial assets excluding goodwill

At the end of each reporting year, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the provision for impairment (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. A provision for impairment is recognised immediately in Profit or Loss.

Where provision for impairment subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no provision for impairment been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of provision for impairment is recognised immediately in Profit or Loss.

# Service concession contracts

Certain assets of the Group are used in connection with concession contracts granted by public sector customers ("concession grantors"). The characteristics of these contracts vary by contract, nevertheless, they generally provide, directly or indirectly, for the concession grantor's involvement on one hand in determining the service and compensation, and on the other, the return of certain assets necessary to perform the service at the end of the contract.

SFRS(I) INT 12 Service Concession Arrangements, is applicable to concession arrangements comprising a public service obligation and meeting the following criteria: the concession grantor controls or regulates the services to be provided by the operator using the asset, the beneficiaries of the service and prices applied; and the concession grantor controls the residual economic value of the assets at the end of the arrangement. For the Group's contracts where SFRS(I) INT 12 applies, the related assets are not recognised as tangible assets, but as financial assets ("financial asset model") of the Group.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (cont'd)

Service concession contracts (cont'd)

Financial asset model

The financial asset model applies if the operator has an unconditional right to receive cash or another financial asset from the concession grantor, in compensation for the concession services and assets provided by the operator. This occurs if the concession grantor contractually guarantees payment of amounts specified or determined in the contract, or of any shortfall, i.e the difference between amounts received from users of the public service and amounts specified or determined in the contract.

Financial assets resulting from the application of SFRS(I) INT 12 are recorded in the Statement of Financial Position under Trade and other receivables as Service concession receivable. They are recognised at amortised cost where the effective interest rate that indicated in the relevant contract forms the basis of recognition as the Group's revenue. The portion that matures in less than one year is presented in "current trade and other receivables" and the portion that matures in more than one year is presented in "non-current trade and other receivables".

In accordance with SFRS(I) 9 Financial Instruments, these assets are impaired using a model based on expected credit losses.

Cash flows generated by the Group in providing concession services and assets under the concession contracts are applied as receipts for the Service concession receivable, and consideration for revenue earned by the Group when it satisfies performance obligations under the contract. These cash flows are included in the Group cash flow statement as part of cash flows from operating activities.

# Fuel price equalisation account

At the direction of the Singapore Public Transport Council ("PTC"), a fuel price equalisation account ("FPEA") has been set up to account for diesel price and electricity tariff adjustment charge for the purpose of mitigating the effects of any increase in fuel price and electricity tariff.

Annual contributions to the FPEA may be required as determined by the PTC, based on the reference electricity tariff and diesel price for the year.

Applications can be made to the PTC to seek approval for a draw down as may be catered for by the purpose of the FPEA mechanism, provided that the amount drawn does not exceed half of the available FPEA balance.

# Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.

The amount recognised as a provision is the present value of the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting year, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.

Provision for accident claims

Claims for accident, public liability and others are provided in the Financial Statements based on the claims outstanding and the estimated amounts payable.

# Deferred income

Deferred income comprises of advance receipts from customers that are recognised to Profit or Loss when the services are rendered.

# Service benefits

These comprise the following:

(i) Retirement benefits

Under the Collective Agreement entered into by certain subsidiaries in Singapore with their relevant unions, a retirement benefit subject to a maximum of \(3,000 is payable to an employee retiring on or after attaining the retirement age and on completion of at least five years of service.

Provision is made in the Financial Statements based on the number of years of service rendered by qualifying employees and discounted to present value using the market yield of Singapore Government Bonds at end of the reporting period and after taking into account an estimated attrition rate. The estimated attrition rate used is based on the Management's best estimate using historical trend.

(ii) Long service awards

Staff of certain subsidiaries in Singapore serving more than 5 years and up to 35 years are entitled to long service awards. Provision is made in the Financial Statements based on the number of years of service rendered by qualifying employees.

(iii) Defined benefit retirement plans

The Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes ("Pension Schemes") for employees of one of its foreign subsidiaries, the assets of which are held in trustee administered funds.

The Pension Schemes were closed to future accruals in 2007 and employees were transferred to a defined contribution pension scheme.

The cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting year. Actuarial gains and losses arising over the financial year are recognised immediately in Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated in equity under retirement benefit reserve and are reflected in the Statement of Financial Position as a pension asset or liability as appropriate. The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Statement of Financial Position represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation net of fair value of plan assets.

Apart from the Pension Schemes above, the Group makes contribution to pension schemes as defined by the laws of the countries in which it has operations. In particular, Singapore Companies make contributions to the Central Provident Fund in Singapore, a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions to pension schemes are recognised as an expense in the period in which the related service is performed.

(iv) Employee leave entitlement

Employee entitlements to annual leave are recognised when they accrue to employees. A provision is made for the estimated liability for annual leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to the end of the reporting year.

(v) Share-based payments

The Company issued share options and share awards to certain employees and Directors within the Group. Share options and share awards are measured at fair value of the equity instruments (excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the share options and share awards are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with a corresponding adjustment against share option and share awards reserve, based on the Company's estimate of the number of equity instruments that will eventually vest.

Fair value for the share option is measured using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on Management's best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. The share options have been fully vested in prior years.

# Government grants

Government grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching to them and the grant will be received.

Government grants whose primary condition is that the Group should purchase, construct or otherwise acquire non-current assets are recognised as deferred grant in the Statement of Financial Position and transferred to Profit or Loss on a systematic and rational basis over the useful lives of the related assets.

Government grants in relation to expenses incurred are recognised in Profit or Loss in the period which they become receivable.

# Revenue recognition

The Group recognises revenue from the following major sources:

Public transport services  
Taxi  
Automotive engineering services  
Inspection and testing services  
Others

Revenue is measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Group recognises revenue when it transfers control of a product to a customer or when services are rendered.

# Public transport services

Revenue from public transport services comes from the provision of bus and rail services to commuters travelling on public transport systems, contracted revenue for operations of scheduled services, provision of coach rental services and provision of non-emergency transport services to patients. Revenue from transport regulators for scheduled bus services is recognised as and when services are rendered, including an estimation of the expected consideration on achieving certain performance targets. Revenue from service concession arrangements are disclosed above under Service Concession Contracts. Revenue from commuters for rail services is recognised as and when services are rendered and revenue from transport regulator for rail services relates to performance incentives for achieving certain performance and service quality targets.

Revenue from other third parties for scheduled services, coach rental services, rail services and non-emergency transport services is recognised as and when services are rendered.

Revenue from other commercial services comprises advertising and rental income. Advertising production revenue is recognised when production is completed and advertising media revenue is recognised on a time proportionate basis over the term relevant contract. Rental income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.

# Taxi

The Group provides taxi rental, network subscriptions and other related services such as cashless payment to third parties. Revenue is recognised as and when services are rendered.

Revenue from payment processing is recognised at the point in time when the payment is processed.

Revenue recognition (cont'd)

Automotive engineering services

The Group provides repair and maintenance services to taxi, buses and third parties. Revenue is recognised as and when services are rendered.

For sales of goods such as spare parts, diesel and petrol to third parties, revenue is recognised when control of the goods has been transferred to the customer, at the point where goods are delivered to the customer.

Inspection and testing services

The Group provides vehicle inspection services and other testing services. Revenue from vehicle inspection services is recognised upon completion of the inspection services.

Revenue from testing services for aerospace, marine and offshore, biotechnology, oil and petrochemical, building construction and electronics manufacturing industries is recognised upon completion of the final test report.

Others

Others include car rental and leasing, driver training and bus station operation.

Car rental and leasing and driver training revenue are recognised at point in time upon completion of the services.

Bus station operation revenue is recognised as and when services are rendered.

# Borrowing costs

Borrowing costs incurred to finance the purchase of assets are capitalised during the period of time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use. Other borrowing costs are recognised in Profit or Loss in the period in which they are incurred.

# Income tax

Current income tax liabilities (and assets) for current and prior periods are recognised at the amounts expected to be paid to (or recovered from) the tax authorities, using the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting year.

Deferred income tax assets/liabilities are recognised for deductible/taxable temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts. The principal temporary differences arise from depreciation, provision for fuel equalisation and future tax benefits from certain provisions not allowed for tax purposes until a later period. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised on taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting year and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

Current and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or income in Profit or Loss, except when they relate to items credited or debited outside Profit or Loss (either in OCI or directly in equity), in which case the tax is also recognised outside Profit or Loss (either in OCI or directly in equity), or where they arise from the initial accounting for a business combination. In the case of a business combination, the tax effect is taken into account in calculating goodwill or determining the excess of the acquirer's interest in the net fair value of the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over cost.

# Foreign currency transactions and translation

The individual Financial Statements of each Group entity are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (its functional currency). The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group and the Statement of Financial Position and Statement of Changes in Equity of the Company are presented in Singapore dollars, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In preparing the Financial Statements of the individual entities, transactions in currencies other than the entity's functional currency are recorded at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction. At the end of each reporting year, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at rates prevailing at the end of each reporting year. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing on the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.

Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on retranslation of monetary items are included in Profit or Loss for the period. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in Profit or Loss for the period except for differences arising on the translation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised in OCI. For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised in OCI.

In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts and options (please see above for details of the Group's accounting policies in respect of such hedging instruments).

For the purpose of presenting Consolidated Financial Statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group's foreign operations (including comparatives) are expressed in Singapore dollars using exchange rates prevailing at the end of the reporting year. Income and expense items (including comparatives) are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuated significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in OCI and accumulate in the Group's currency translation reserve. Such translation differences are recognised in Profit or Loss in the period in which the foreign operation is disposed of.

The Group has applied the option to reset the cumulative foreign currency translation differences for all foreign operations to zero at the date of transition to SFRS(I) on 1 January 2017. As a result, the cumulative foreign currency translation loss was reclassified from foreign currency translation reserve to accumulated profits as at 1 January 2017. After the date of transaction, any gain or loss on disposal of any foreign operation will exclude translation differences that arose before the date of transition.

On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities (including monetary items that, in substance, form part of the net investment in foreign entities), and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are recognised in OCI and accumulated in the currency translation reserve.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of a foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.

# Cash and cash equivalents in the group cash flow statement

Cash and cash equivalents in the Group Cash Flow Statement comprise cash on hand and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

# 3. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY

In the application of the Group's accounting policies, which are described in Note 2, Management is required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

# 3.1 Critical judgements in applying the Group's accounting policies

The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimates (see below), that Management has made in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies and that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Financial Statements:

Provision for rail contract

In projecting the future financial performance of the Downtown Line ("DTL"), North East Line ("NEL") and Sengkang Punggol Light Rail Transport ("SPLRT") under the Consolidated Rail Licence as disclosed in Note 38, applying appropriate key assumptions relating to ridership growth, fare adjustments, availability of grants from the Authorities and operating costs projections. The Group also considers external information regarding forecasted economic indicators and geopolitical risk factors that could affect key operating costs drivers such as labour and energy costs. Based on SBS Transit Ltd ("SBST")s Management's assessment, no provision for rail contract is required. Accordingly, the Group has not made provision on that basis.

Accounting for contracts with public transport regulator

The Group's Public Transport Services segment has entered into contracts with the public transport regulator (the "Grantor") whereby the Group operates bus and/or train assets and related infrastructure that are either owned by the Group or leased from the Grantor (the "Public Transport Assets") to provide public transportation services.

As part of determining the appropriate accounting treatments for these contracts, the Group applies judgement to determine whether these public-to-private arrangements are within the scope of SFRS(I) INT 12 Service Concession Arrangements that would affect the manner that the Public Transport Assets, the related expenditures incurred by the Group, the service and fare income earned by the Group, and payments made to the Grantor under these contracts are recognised in the Group's Statement of financial position and Income Statement. The applicability of SFRS(I) INT 12 is based on an assessment of whether the Grantor has both the control over the services to be provided using the Assets, and the residual interests at the end of the contract.

Key sources of estimation uncertainty

The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting year, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.

# 3.2 Provisions

Accident claims

Claims for property damage and personal injury are provided in the Financial Statements based on the claims outstanding as of the end of the financial year and estimated amounts payable. The past claims history and payment trends are used as a basis to estimate the amounts in which the Group will have to pay to third parties for such claims. The provision for accident claims included in Note 22 is $45.0 million (2023: $43.2 million).

# 3. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY (cont'd)

# 3.3 Impairment review of taxi vehicles, taxi licences, goodwill and investment in subsidiaries

The Group tests goodwill and taxi licences with infinite useful lives for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are indications that they might be impaired. Impairment assessment is also performed for taxi vehicles with finite useful lives when there is an impairment indication. The Company assess any indicator for impairment for investments in subsidiaries annually, or more frequently if there are indications that they might be impaired.

Determining whether taxi vehicles, taxi licences with infinite useful lives, goodwill and investment in subsidiaries are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units ("CGUs") to which subsidiaries, taxi vehicles, taxi licences and goodwill have been allocated (Notes 9, 13, 14 and 15). The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. A provision for impairment loss on taxi vehicles, taxi licences, goodwill and investment in subsidiaries is recognised in Profit or Loss and can be reversed in the subsequent period except for goodwill when the amount of impairment loss decreases.

The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to profit margins during the period.

The Group and the Company prepare cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by Management for the next year and extrapolates cash flows based on estimated growth rate. The estimated terminal growth rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets and countries in which the CGU operates.

The discount rates applied to the forecast for the Group and the Company are based on current market assessment of the time value of money and risks specific to the business segment.

For the public transport services businesses in Australia and the United Kingdom, discount rates of  $6.5\%$  (2023:  $6.5\%$ ) and  $7.7\%$  (2023:  $7.8\%$ ), and terminal growth rates of  $3.4\%$  (2023:  $3.4\%$ ) and  $1.0\%$  (2023:  $0.6\%$ ) are applied to the forecasts respectively.

For the taxi businesses in China and Singapore, discount rates of  $7.5\%$  (2023:  $8.0\%$ ) and  $6.8\%$  (2023:  $8.5\%$ ), and growth rates of  $2.5\%$  (2023:  $2.5\%$ ) and  $2.0\%$  (2023:  $2.5\%$ ) are applied to the forecasts respectively.

The expected changes to profit margins are based on past performance and Management's expectation of market development.

# 3.4 Allowance for inventory obsolescence

The Group's inventories comprised mainly parts, accessories and consumable stock required for the operation and maintenance of vehicles and equipment.

The terms of the rail licence contract and useful life of buses are considered in the determination of the useful life of the inventories. In addition to identification of obsolete inventories based on considerations such as phasing out of vehicle models and inventories purchased for specific projects which have ended, Management identifies inventories that are slow moving and evaluates the carrying value of inventories. An allowance for inventory obsolescence is recognised for these inventories based on its useful life and inventory turnover. Allowance for inventory obsolescence is disclosed in Note 7.

# 3.5 Useful lives of vehicles, premises and equipment

As described in Notes 2 and 13, the Group reviews the estimated useful lives of vehicles, premises and equipment at the end of each annual reporting year. During the financial year, Management determined that the estimated useful lives of vehicles, premises and equipment are appropriate and no material revision is required.

# 3.6 Goodwill arising from acquisition of businesses

Goodwill arising from acquisition of subsidiaries during the year was determined using a purchase price allocation exercise to determine the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities as disclosed in Note 15. Management exercised significant judgement in determining the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities including any intangibles.

The credit period on sale of goods and rendering of services ranges from 7 days to 60 days (2023: 7 days to 60 days) except for insurance claims against third parties which have no credit period due to their nature.

The Group adopts the policy of dealing only with customers of appropriate credit history. The expected risks of default on trade and other receivables at the reporting date are insignificant as majority of receivables are from the transport regulators, Government related agencies and insurance companies. Management has assessed the credit risk to be low. The receivables that are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided for are insignificant. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.

Included within the carrying amount of \(354.2 million (2023: \)205.7 million) is \)173.4 million (2023: $173.1 million) of taxi licences in China and \)6.9 million (2023: $6.8 million) of brands in the United Kingdom with indefinite lives. These taxi licences and brands are not amortised because there is no foreseeable limit to the cash flows generated. The carrying amount of intangible assets with indefinite life is allocated to the respective CGUs in China and United Kingdom.

The Group has conducted an analysis of the sensitivity of the impairment test to changes in the key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for each CGU to which taxi licences is allocated as discussed in Note 3.

The remaining balance of \(173.9 million (2023: \)25.8 million) mainly relates to \(2.0 million (2023: \)3.1 million) of rights under contract and $14.8 million (2023: Nil) of software in Australia, \)60.3 million (2023: \(6.1 million) of brands, \)33.4 million (2023: \)0.8 million) of customer relationship and $30.0 million (2023: Nil) software development costs in the United Kingdom, \)29.4 million (2023: \(12.1 million) of software development costs and \)2.6 million (2023: \)3.0 million) of customer relationship in Singapore with finite useful lives over which the assets are amortised. The useful lives of intangible assets are ranging from 2 to 20 years (2023: 2 to 20 years).

The assessment of the potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes is based on the most recent tax filings, country-by-country reporting and financial statements for the constituent entities in the Group. Based on the assessment, the Pillar Two effective tax rates in most of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates are above  $15\%$  except for Ireland where the transitional safe harbour relief does not apply. Notwithstanding, considering the scale of the business operations in Ireland and the Pillar Two effective tax rate is close to  $15\%$ , the Group does not expect a material exposure to Pillar Two income taxes.

# (b) Financial risk management policies and objectives

The main areas of financial risk faced by the Group are foreign exchange rate risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and fuel price risk. The Group recognises that management of financial risk is an important aspect in its drive towards creating shareholders' value. It is the Group's policy not to participate in speculative financial instruments. Management oversees financial risk management and regularly reviews its policy governing risk management practices.

There has been no change to the Group's exposure to these financial risks or the manner in which it manages and measures these risks.

# (i) Foreign exchange risk management

The Group manages its foreign exchange exposure by matching revenue and costs in the relevant currencies to create a natural hedge and also through active currency management using hedging instruments such as forwards and options where necessary. The Group's revenue is mainly denominated in Singapore Dollar ("SGD") with the remaining in Great British Pound ("GBP"), Renminbi ("RMB"), Australian Dollar ("AUD"), Euro ("EUR") and Malaysian Ringgit ("MYR"). On the cost side, its foreign currency exposures include United States Dollar ("USD"), GBP, RMB, AUD, EUR and MYR. The Group has investments in the United Kingdom, China, Australia, Ireland and Malaysia. Net translation risks are regularly monitored and the Group currently does not seek to hedge this exposure as it does not impact cash flows.

# Foreign currency sensitivity

The bulk of the Group's foreign currency exposures are in the functional currencies of its respective operations. Exposures to foreign currencies that are non-functional are actively managed as part of the overall foreign exchange risk management. Based on sensitivity analysis performed, Management has assessed that exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates arising from assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies of entities in the Group is minimal.

(b) Financial risk management policies and objectives (cont'd)

(ii) Interest rate risk management

The Group's primary interest rate risk relates to its borrowings, investments in fixed income securities and deposits. The Group uses hedging instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps, where necessary, to achieve the desired interest rate profile in its effort to manage interest rate risk. The Group may borrow at variable rates and uses interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of future interest payments, which have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating rates to fixed rates.

Interest rate sensitivity

The Group has interest-bearing assets such as fixed income securities and deposits as well as interest-bearing liabilities. Any change in interest rate affecting the interest-bearing assets shall have an offsetting impact from the interest-bearing liabilities. Based on sensitivity analysis performed at the end of the reporting year, Management has assessed that the exposure to changes in interest rates is minimal and hence the resulting impact on the profit or other comprehensive income of the Group is insignificant.

(iii) Credit risk management

The Group has minimal credit risk arising from its commuter transport operations as the majority of revenue is collected in cash upfront or from the transport regulator in the case of Singapore, United Kingdom and Australia. For the other operations, credit risk is also minimised via upfront deposits, strict credit terms and regular monitoring of debtors' financial standing. The Group enters into treasury transactions only with creditworthy institutions. Its investments in fixed income instruments are above investment grade as assigned by international credit-rating agencies. In its management of credit risk, the Group practises stringent credit review and sets counterparty credit limits. There is no significant concentration of credit risk.

Cash and deposits are kept with reputable financial institutions. There is no significant concentration of credit risk.

The carrying amount of financial assets represents the Group's maximum exposure to credit risk as disclosed in the notes to the Financial Statements.

The Group develops and maintains its credit risk gradings to categorise exposures according to their degree of risk of default. The Group uses its own trading records to rate its major customers and other debtors.

(iv) Liquidity risk management

The Group funds its operations through a mix of internal funds and bank borrowings. It regularly reviews its liquidity position comprising free cash flows from its operations and credit lines from banks to ensure its ability to access funding at any time at the best possible rates.

(v) Fuel price risk management

Fuel, comprising diesel and electricity, is part of the operating costs of the Group. The Group is also exposed to fluctuations in fuel price in its bus and rail operations and diesel and petrol sales business. The Group seeks to hedge the price risk associated with its fuel needs after considering fuel indexation in its contracts with various local authorities and uses hedging instruments, where necessary, to achieve the desired hedge outcome.

Based on sensitivity analysis performed and taking into account the fuel hedges in place, as at the end of the reporting year, every one percentage point change in the rates of diesel, petrol and electricity using the closing rates as at the end of the reporting year as a basis will impact the Group's annual fuel and electricity costs by  $0.4 million (2023:$ 0.5 million). The sensitivity analysis assumes that consumption is held constant at the same level as in 2024.

(b) Financial risk management policies and objectives (cont'd)

(vi) Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other current receivables and payables, provisions and other liabilities approximate their respective fair values due to the relatively short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The fair values of other classes of financial assets and liabilities are disclosed in the respective notes to the Financial Statements.

The Group classifies fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:

(a) quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1);  
(b) inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly (Level 2); and  
(c) inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (Level 3).

The majority of the fair value of the Group's investments are classified into Level 1. The Group's hedging instruments, if any, are classified into Level 2. Fair value of the financial instruments classified in Level 3 is insignificant. There are also no transfers between Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy during the financial year.

(c) Hedging instruments

The Group utilises hedging instruments to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows.

The Group's hedging instruments are measured at fair value whereby future cash flows are estimated based on contracted rates and observable forward rates at the end of the reporting year, discounted at a rate that reflects the credit risk of the various counterparties.

At the end of the reporting year, the Group has outstanding fuel hedge with notional amounts totalling $5.2 million (2023: $11.9 million).

At the end of the reporting year, the Group has outstanding foreign exchange hedge with notional amounts totalling $1.5 million (2023: $3.2 million).

The fair value of the Group's hedging instruments, based on market prices for equivalent instruments at the end of the reporting year, comprised  $0.3 million of liabilities (2023:$ 1.1 million of liabilities) was matched by an equivalent fair value adjustment on cash flow hedges in Other Comprehensive Income.

The Group uses forward contracts and options to manage its exposure to foreign exchange risks. These arrangements are designed to address foreign exchange risk on future purchases of goods and are accounted for as cash flow hedges.

The Group uses fuel hedging contracts to manage its exposure to fuel price risks. These arrangements are designed to address fuel price exposure on future purchases of fuel and are accounted for as cash flow hedges.

# (d) Capital risks management policies and objectives

The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.

Management monitors the gross and net gearing of the Group and its implication on weighted average cost of capital in deciding the optimal capital structure. These objectives determine the Group's decisions on the amount of dividends to be paid to shareholders and the sources of capital to be raised, be it equity or debt. The Group's debt capital refers to borrowings comprising loans under Notes 17(a) and 17(b) and lease liabilities from financial institutions under Note 18 while equity refers to total equity.

No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 2024 and 2023.

(b) Subsequent to the end of the financial year, the Directors of the Company recommended that a tax-exempt one-tier final dividend of 4.25 cents per ordinary share (2023: 3.76 cents per ordinary share) totalling $92.1 million. The dividends are subject to approval by shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and hence the proposed dividends have not been accrued as a liability for the current financial year.

Together with the tax-exempt one-tier interim dividend of 3.52 cents per ordinary share (2023: 2.90 cents per ordinary share), total distributions paid and proposed in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2024 will be 7.77 cents per ordinary share (2023: 6.66 cents per ordinary share).

# 38. LICENCE FOR RAIL SERVICES

# Consolidated Rail Licence as part of NRFF (Version 2)

On 11 November 2022, a subsidiary of the Group, SBST entered into a framework agreement with Land Transport Authority ("LTA") and SBS Transit DTL Pte. Ltd. (now known as SBS Transit Rail Pte. Ltd.) to transit the DTL to NRFF (Version 2). Under this framework agreement, LTA will issue a Consolidated Rail Licence to SBS Transit Rail Pte. Ltd., to operate the DTL, NEL and SPLRT. The NRFF (Version 2) is designed to reduce commercial volatility for rail operators in delivering a reliable and financially sustainable public rail service.

The Consolidated Rail Licence took effect from 1 January 2022 to operate the NEL, SPLRT and the DTL for a period of 11 years. This Consolidated Rail Licence supersedes the licence granted to NEL, SPLRT dated 1 April 2018 and the licence granted to DTL dated 19 December 2013.

Under NRFF Version 2, LTA owns and pay for the operating assets, including additions, renewals and replacements. In exchange for the right to operate, maintain and derive revenue from the Licensed Systems, SBST will pay an annual licence charge to the LTA over the licence period. The licence charge structure under the NRFF provides for some sharing between SBST and LTA of the revenue risks under the Fare Revenue Shortfall Sharing as well as profit sharing via an Earnings Before Interest and Tax Cap/Collar. These are explained below:

(i) Fare Revenue Shortfall Sharing ("FRSS")

The licence charge structure has a FRSS mechanism which offers some level of protection against revenue risks arising from uncertainties in ridership and fares. Under this mechanism, if the actual revenue falls short of the target revenue by  $2\%$  to  $6\%$ , LTA will share  $50\%$  of the shortfall. If the shortfall between the actual revenue and the target revenue exceeds  $6\%$ , LTA will bear  $75\%$  of the incremental revenue shortfall beyond  $6\%$ .

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2024

# 38. LICENCE FOR RAIL SERVICES (cont'd)

(ii) Earnings Before Interest and Tax ("EBIT") Cap/Collar

The licence charge structure provides for profit sharing via an EBIT (as computed in accordance with the licence agreement) cap and collar mechanism whereby LTA shares in the upside of the EBIT above the cap as well as the downside risks below the collar. If the EBIT margin is lower than  $3.50\%$ , LTA will share  $50\%$  of the shortfall. LTA's sharing of the shortfall is limited by the amount of licence charge payable by the SBS Transit Rail Pte.Ltd. for the year. If the EBIT margin exceeds the cap of  $5\%$ , the excess will be shared via a tiered structure, whereby  $85\%$  to  $95\%$  of the incremental EBIT above the  $5\%$  cap will be shared with LTA.

LTA's sharing under the FRSS and/or the EBIT Cap/Collar is limited by the amount of licence charge payable by the SBS Transit Rail Pte.Ltd. for the year.

In addition, the LTA may reimburse or be reimbursed by SBS Transit Rail Pte.Ltd. when new regulatory changes initiated by LTA after the transition lead to changes in operating costs or revenue. Regulatory changes that may impact operating costs or revenue include modifications to operating performance standards for the rail lines, maintenance performance standards for the operating assets, key performance indicators or codes of practice and changes in rentable and advertising spaces available for generating non-fare revenue.

# 39. CONTRACTS UNDER THE BUS CONTRACTING MODEL ("BCM")

A subsidiary of the Group, SBST entered into public bus services contracts (collectively known as the "Negotiated Contract") with LTA for the operation of public bus services under the BCM. The Negotiated Contract was effective from 1 September 2016 following the expiry of the Bus Service Operating Licence on 31 August 2016.

Under the BCM, LTA retains all fare revenue collected from the provision of the bus services. Revenue for SBST is derived from the provision of bus services which comprises service fee and leasing fee. The service fee is indexed to changes in wage levels, inflation and fuel costs. In addition, SBST retains revenue from other commercial services comprising advertising and rental.

As part of the Negotiated Contract, SBST makes available its fleet of close to 2,400 buses to LTA as of 31 December 2024. In consideration of SBST using its fleet for the provision of the bus services, LTA pays an availability fee based on the depreciation of the buses over the statutory lifespan. LTA also pays an availability fee for the use of the other existing assets of SBST (bus depot and related equipment) based on the depreciation of such assets.

SBST performance will be assessed annually under an incentive-disincentive framework including key performance indicators such as bus service availability, bus punctuality and maintenances of buses, bus interchanges, bus depots and bus ticketing system.

In addition to operating and managing bus services to specified performance standards, SBST's responsibilities include the following:

(a) Operate, manage and maintain the buses and their on-board equipment;  
(b) Operate, and maintain the bus interchanges, bus depots including the equipment and systems therein;  
(c) Operate the buses, bus depots and related equipment that are provided by LTA for the provision of the Bus Services;  
(d) Charge and collect fares as approved by the PTC, on behalf of LTA, for travel on the bus services;  
(e) Provide bus service information at all bus stops and bus interchanges served by the bus services; and  
(f) Provide customer management services, such as lost and found service, and a hotline for commuter feedback and enquiries.

# 41. ACQUISITION OF SUBSIDIARIES

During the financial year, the Group entered into the following business combinations:

In February 2024, the Group completed the acquisition of CMAC Group Limited ("CMAC"), an unlisted company based in the United Kingdom that is mainly engaged in managing ground transportation and accommodation. The acquisition is aligned with the Group's growth plan as a global mobility leader and expands its footprint to 12 countries worldwide in the business of taxis and private hire vehicles, public buses and inter-city coach services.  
ii) In April 2024, the Group completed the acquisition of A2B Australia Limited ("A2B"), a listed company based in Australia that principally engaged in provision or facilitate taxi bookings, trips, and payments. The acquisition presented a unique opportunity for the Group to acquire a portfolio of businesses in line with the Group's strategy to scale its point-to-point mobility business in Australia.  
iii) In November 2024, the Group completed the acquisition of Atlas Topco Limited ("AL"), a private limited company incorporated in the United Kingdom that is principally engaged in the provision of ground transportation activities, including private hire and managed vehicles, executive cars and chauffeurings services, and courier services.

In prior year, the Group acquired a  $70\%$  stake in An Security Pte Ltd from Michael Ee Hock Meng and Koh Eng Haur and the entire issued share capital of KingKabs Limited (formerly known as Vedamain) from Nigel Hugh David Thomas and Caroline Jane Thomas.

* As part of the purchase agreement, a variable consideration has been agreed where additional cash payments to the previous owners will be made if certain conditions are met.

From the date of acquisition, the subsidiaries acquired contributed  $412.4 million of revenue and$ 33.7 million of operating profit to the Group. If the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the year, revenue and operating profit for the Group would have increased by a further $350.0 million and $45.0 million respectively.

Goodwill arose in the acquisition because the consideration paid for the combination included amounts in relation to the benefit of expected synergies, revenue growth, future market development and the assembled workforce. These benefits are not recognised separately from goodwill because they do not meet the recognition criteria for identifiable intangible assets.

The finalisation of the goodwill amount is dependent on the completion of the valuation of net assets acquired.

None of the goodwill arising from these acquisitions is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

# EXPLANATORY NOTES:

# ORDINARY BUSINESS:

(a) Resolution 3 is to approve the payment of Directors' fees for the Non-Executive Directors of the Company during the financial year ending 31 December 2025 ("FY2025"). The actual Directors' fees incurred for FY2024 was S$1,516,196. The projected Directors' fees for FY2025 is higher than the Directors' fees approved for FY2024 to cater to an additional Board Committee as well as Directors' attendance at some of the newly acquired business units overseas to familiarise themselves with their respective operations. If the Resolution is passed, the Non-Executive Directors can be paid during the financial year in which the fees are incurred. In the event that the amount proposed is insufficient, approval will be sought at the next Annual General Meeting before any payments are made to the Non-Executive Directors for the shortfall.  
(b) Mr Mark Christopher Greaves $^{(1)}$  will, upon re-election as a Director of the Company, continue to serve as Chairman of the Board, the Nominating and Remuneration Committee and the Strategy & Investment Committee, and as a member of the Sustainability Committee.

(c) Mr Choi Shing Kwok<sup>(1)</sup> will, upon re-election as a Director of the Company, continue to serve as Deputy Chairman of the Board, and as a member of the Nominating and Remuneration Committee, the Strategy & Investment Committee and the Sustainability Committee. Mr Choi will be considered an Independent Non-Executive Director of the Company.  
(d) Mr Russell Stephen Balding AO $^{(1)}$  will, upon re-election as a Director of the Company, continue to serve as a member of the Audit and Risk Committee, the Nominating and Remuneration Committee and the Strategy & Investment Committee. Mr Balding will be considered an Independent Non-Executive Director of the Company, pursuant to Rule 704(8) of the Listing Manual of the SGX-ST.  
(e) Mr Lee Jee Cheng Philip<sup>(1)</sup> will, upon re-election as a Director of the Company, continue to serve as Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee and as a member of the Nominating and Remuneration Committee.

# NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING

# SPECIAL BUSINESS:

(f) Ordinary Resolution 9, if passed, will empower the Directors to offer and grant Awards under the Scheme in accordance with the provisions of the Scheme and to issue from time to time such number of fully paid Shares as may be required to be issued pursuant to the vesting of the Awards subject to the maximum number of Shares prescribed under the terms and conditions of the Scheme. The aggregate number of Shares which may be issued pursuant to the Scheme and any other share-based schemes (if applicable) shall not exceed in aggregate (for the entire duration of the Scheme) two per centum (2%) of the total number of issued Shares (excluding treasury shares and subsidiary holdings) from time to time. The Scheme was approved at the AGM of the Company held on 26 April 2018.  
(g) Ordinary Resolution 10, if passed, will renew the Share Buyback Mandate, and empower the Directors to exercise all powers of the Company to purchase or otherwise acquire (whether by way of Market Purchases or Off-Market Purchases) Shares on the terms of the Share Buyback Mandate as set out in the Circular to Shareholders dated 26 March 2025 (the "Circular"), which is available at www.comfortdelgro.com.

The Company may use internal and external sources of funds to finance its purchases or acquisitions of Shares. The Directors do not propose to exercise the Share Buyback Mandate to such extent that it would result in any material adverse effect on the listing status of the Shares on the SGX-ST, liquidity and/or the orderly trading of the Shares and/or the financial position of the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Group"). The amount of financing required for the Company to purchase its Shares pursuant to the Share Buyback Mandate and the impact on the Company's financial position cannot be realistically ascertained as at the date of this Notice as this will depend on factors such as the aggregate number of Shares purchased, whether the Shares are purchased or acquired out of capital or profits, the purchase prices paid at the relevant times, and whether the Shares purchased or acquired are held in treasury or cancelled.

The rationale for the Share Buyback Mandate, the source of funds to be used for the Share Buyback Mandate, the impact of the Share Buyback Mandate on the Company's financial position, the implications arising as a result of the Share Buyback Mandate under The Singapore Code on Take-overs and Mergers and on the listing of the Company's Shares on the SGX-ST are set out in the Circular, which is enclosed together with this Notice.

An illustration of the total number of Shares which may be purchased or acquired by the Company up to the Maximum Limit, pursuant to the Share Buyback Mandate, is contained in paragraph 3.2.1 of the Circular.

An illustration of the maximum amount of financing or funds required for the purchase or acquisition of Shares up to the Maximum Limit at the relevant Maximum Price in the case of Market Purchases and an illustration of the maximum amount of financing or funds required for the purchase or acquisition of Shares up to the Maximum Limit at the relevant Maximum Price in the case of Off-Market Purchases, pursuant to the Share Buyback Mandate, are contained in paragraph 3.5.2(b) of the Circular.

An illustration of the financial impact of the purchase or acquisitions of Shares by the Company pursuant to the Share Buyback Mandate on the audited financial statements of the Group for the financial year ended 31 December 2024 is set out in the Circular.

A share buyback mandate (the "2024 Mandate") on the same terms was renewed at the AGM of the Company held on 26 April 2024. Details of the Company's acquisition of Shares pursuant to the 2024 Mandate are contained in paragraph 3.9 of the Circular.

# NOTES:

1. A proxy need not be a member of the Company. The Chairman of the Meeting, as proxy, need not be a member of the Company.  
2. Where a member appoints two (2) proxies, he/she should specify the proportion of his/her shareholding to be represented by each proxy, failing which the nomination shall be deemed to be alternative.  
3. A member, who is a relevant intermediary entitled to attend the meeting and vote, is entitled to appoint more than two (2) proxies to attend and vote instead of the member, but each proxy must be appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by each member. Where such member appoints more than two (2) proxies, the appointments shall be invalid unless the member specifies the number of shares in relation to which each proxy has been appointed.

"Relevant intermediary" means:

(a) a banking corporation licensed under the Banking Act 1970 of Singapore, or a wholly-owned subsidiary of such a banking corporation, whose business includes the provision of nominee services and who holds shares in that capacity;  
(b) a person holding a capital markets services licence to provide custodial services for securities under the Securities and Futures Act 2001 of Singapore, and who holds shares in that capacity; or  
(c) the Central Provident Fund Board ("CPF Board") established by the Central Provident Fund Act 1953 of Singapore, in respect of shares purchased under the subsidiary legislation made under that Act providing for the making of investments from the contributions and interest standing to the credit of members of the Central Provident Fund, if the CPF Board holds those shares in the capacity of an intermediary pursuant to or in accordance with that subsidiary legislation.

4. A member should insert the total number of shares held. If the member has shares entered against his/her name in the Depository Register (maintained by The Central Depository (Pte) Limited), he/she should insert that number of shares. If the member has shares registered in his/her name in the Register of Members of the Company, he/she should insert that number of shares. If the member has shares entered against his/her name in the Depository Register and shares registered in his/her name in the Register of Members, he/she should insert the aggregate number of shares. If no number is inserted, this form of proxy will be deemed to relate to all the shares held by the member.  
5. The instrument appointing a proxy, together with the power of attorney or other authority under which it is signed (if applicable) or a duly certified copy thereof, must be submitted in the following manner:

(a) If submitted by post, be deposited at the Company's registered office at 205 Braddell Road, Singapore 579701; or  
(b) If submitted by electronic mail, be sent to agm2025@comfortdelgro.com; or  
(c) If submitted electronically, be lodged at the Company's AGM pre-registration website, www.conveneagm.sg/CDG_AGM2025

in each case, by 10.00 a.m. on Tuesday, 22 April 2025, being not less than seventy-two (72) hours before the time appointed for the holding of the AGM.

6. The instrument appointing a proxy must be signed by the appointor or his/her attorney duly authorised in writing. Where the instrument appointing a proxy is executed by a corporation, it shall be executed either under its common seal or under the hand of any officer or attorney duly authorised. The power of attorney or other authority, if any, under which the instrument of proxy is signed on behalf of the member or duly certified copy of that power of attorney or other authority (failing previous registration with the Company) shall be attached to the instrument of proxy, failing which the instrument may be treated as invalid.  
7. CPF or SRS Investors who wish to vote at the AGM should approach their respective agent banks to submit their votes at least seven (7) working days before the date of the AGM (i.e., by 10.00 a.m. on Monday, 14 April 2025) CPF/SRS Investors should contact their respective agent banks for any queries they may have with regard to the appointment of proxy for the AGM.  
8. The Company shall be entitled to reject an instrument appointing a proxy if it is incomplete, improperly completed, illegible or where the true intentions of the appointor are not ascertainable from the instructions of the appointor specified on the instrument. In addition, in the case of shares entered in the Depository Register, the Company may reject any instrument appointing a proxy which has been lodged if the member, being the appointor, is not shown to have shares entered against his/her name in the Depository Register as at seventy-two (72) hours before the time appointed for holding the AGM, as certified by The Central Depository (Pte) Limited to the Company.
