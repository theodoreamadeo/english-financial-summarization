DEAR VALUED SHAREHOLDERS, ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF EKOVEST BERHAD, IWOULD LIKE TO PRESENT TO YOU OUR ANNUAL REPORT AND THE GROUP'S REPORTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024.

# INDUSTRY TRENDS

Despite escalating uncertainties in the global landscape, Malaysia's economy remains resilient. The GDP is forecast to expand by approximately between  $4\%$  and  $5\%$  in 2024. Ekonomi MADANI framework, which aimed at building a better Malaysia together, underscores the collective commitment and dedication from all stakeholders to ensure the successful realisation of the economic development goals and national aspirations. The Budget 2024 marks the start of Malaysia's journey to rebuild a sustainable, inclusive, and buoyant economy as envisioned in the Ekonomi MADANI framework. The construction sector is forecasted to increase by  $6.8\%$  in 2024, this growth momentum in the construction industry in Malaysia is expected to continue to grow steadily in 2024.

# INDUSTRY TRENDS (Cont'd)

The growth in the construction sector is driven by the better performance across all subsectors. In the civil engineering subsector, growth is expected to recover in line with the government's focus on completing large infrastructure projects and increased investment on industrial and energy projects. The construction sector continued to expand in the first quarter of 2024, rising by  $14.2\%$  to record RM36.8 billion value of work done according to the Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM), this is supported by further improving economic conditions.

# INDUSTRY TRENDS (CONT'D)

The civil engineering subsector is anticipated to regain its positive growth, following the continuation and acceleration of major infrastructure projects, such as Light Rail Transit Line 3 (LRT3), Mass Rail Transit Line 3 (MRT3), Johor-Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) as well as the Pan Borneo highways in Sabah and Sarawak. The potential revival of the MRT 3 project, alongside revivals in other government infrastructure and continuity in foreign direct investment from date centres, semiconductor factories and industrial warehouse are pointing towards a better year for the construction sector.

Similarly, the residential buildings subsector is projected to improve further in line with the Government's effort to increase more affordable houses as outlined under the Mid Term Review of the Twelfth Plan, the MADANI Neighbourhood scheme, as well as new launching by the private sector. In addition, the non-residential buildings subsector is anticipated to improve, backed by ongoing commercial projects, namely Kwasa Damansara, Tun Razak Exchange and KLIA Aeropolis.

Malaysia's property sector poised for sustainable growth in 2024. The property sector has demonstrated commendable 1st half year 2024 performance, signalling a promising trajectory for the property industry fuelled by strategic developments and growing investor interest. The key catalysts supporting the growth are the strong economic growth momentum, significant investments and adaptive market trends. Demand remains strong despite cautious consumer sentiments, and the current climate of rich incentives introduced by the government presents attractive property opportunities for those on good financial footing. The property market is expected to regain its momentum in 2024 though the environment remained challenging. Particularly, in Johor, growth in transaction volumes and values were recorded in both the condominium, apartment and service apartment categories, reflecting a vibrant market driven by strategic developments such as the upcoming Johor Baru – Singapore Rapid Transit System Link.

The Growth in the agriculture sector is expected to expand, primarily due to a recovery in oil palm production. Slightly higher-than-average rainfall in the beginning of the year due to the La Nina phenomenon is expected to improve oil palm yields particularly towards the later part of the year. In the Twelfth Malaysian Plan, the agriculture sector will be transformed and modernised into a high-income and sustainable sector. Efforts will be focused on ensuring food security, improving productivity, increasing skills of farmers, fishermen and smallholders, enhancing support and delivery services, strengthening the supply chain and ensuring compliance to international market requirements.

# FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

Throughout the past year, we remain committed to implementing our strategy to transform Ekovest into a larger listed conglomerate with a portfolio of diversified businesses to reduce dependency on our existing businesses in construction, property development and toll operations in the ever-changing and uncertain landscape. We are now intensely focused on cultivating growth drivers for our businesses and rejuvenating key management teams to drive us forward. Notwithstanding the challenges faces in financial year ended 30 June 2024 ("FYE2024"), Ekovest Berhad ("Ekovest") and its subsidiaries (the "Group") have managed to adapt and will continue with our efforts to drive operational and cost efficiency throughout all business segment within the Group.

In FYE2024, Ekovest registered revenue of RM1.147 billion, an increase of approximately  $2.7\%$  as compared to revenue of RM1.117 billion achieved in the previous financial year ended 30 June 2023 ("FYE2023"). Our construction division continues to be the main revenue driver, contributing RM640.7 million or  $55.9\%$  of total revenue, while our toll operations remained the second largest revenue contributor with RM310.8 million or  $27.1\%$ . Our plantation division had contributed RM114.9 million or  $10.0\%$  and our property development and property investment divisions contributed RM64.3 million or  $5.6\%$  to the total revenue achieved in FYE2024.

The increase in revenue was mainly attributable to the increase in construction activities mainly attributed to the progress of our Rapid Transit System Link ("RTS Link") project during this FYE2024. Our toll operations division reported a growth in revenue with improved traffic volume throughout FYE2024 further contributed by the increase in toll revenue after the opening of the new Setiawangsa-Pantai Expressway ("SPE") on 3 November 2023. The revenue from the sales of the completed residential units in EkoCheras has gradually decreased due to lower units available for sale as compared to the FYE2023 wherein the Company has just obtained the Bumi Release for EkoCheras. The Loss Before Tax ("LBT") for FYE2024 stood at RM50.4 million as compared to the LBT reported in FYE2023 of RM9.9 million. Despite the Group's lower deferred tax expenses amounting to RM35.6 million, mainly from our toll operation division as compared to FYE2023 of RM81.3 million, the Group reported a Loss After Tax ("LAT") of RM118.2 million in FYE2024 as compared to a LAT of RM109.3 million in FYE2023.

# STRATEGIC REVIEW

The plans that we have implemented is part of our strategy to transform Ekovest into a larger listed conglomerate with a larger portfolio of diversified businesses and is in line with the long-term strategy of expanding and diversifying into other businesses to reduce dependency and reliance on our existing businesses in construction, property development and toll operations. Our strategic focus is to put us in a strong position to benefit from longer-term growth. Our hybrid business model creates long-term shareholders' value by harnessing the benefits of our complementary businesses – construction, property development, plantation and highway concession. This model limits the impact of economic cycles and allows us to prioritise high-quality businesses, in order to improve margins and deliver disciplined revenue growth.

The Group has remained focused on delivering sustainable growth and long-term shareholders' value. We will continue to take appropriate and deliberate actions to drive performance while maintaining financial prudence. We will continue to navigate our way through the challenges to promote and grow the Group's various businesses. We are committed to improving the construction industry and we understand the wider impact that our businesses can achieve to support the development of the nation through the delivery of sustainable quality in our buildings, roads, public spaces, infrastructure and other construction areas.

The contracts that we have secured, specifically the RTS Link project connecting Johor Bahru and Singapore, will augur well for our construction division and we will continue to focus and engage with the Government on new projects which we have submitted, including the DUKE Phase 2A. Upon the upliftment of the MCO, the Group has experienced steady increase in toll revenue for Duke Phase 1 and Phase 2 and the new opening of the SPE will further increase the tolling revenue for our toll operations segment.

We have also taken steps to grow further and have taken to bold step to invest in a property development project in Singapore. We will use this investment and experience gained to be the yardstick to measure our technical capabilities and to ascertain if we have what it takes to compete at international level.

# STRATEGIC REVIEW (CONT'D)

Our subsidiary, PLS Plantations Berhad ("PLS") transformation journey from the cyclical oil palm plantation company to a more diversified range of upstream and downstream plantation activities will require a longer gestation period. In particular, the gestation period for the durian trees is about 4 to 5 years and thus, the existing revenues from durian fruits are now mainly from trading activities. In the near term, PLS will continue its current rehabilitation and sanitation works with emphasis on recommended plantation practices to improve the production yield of its oil palm estates, maturing durian plantation and contract farming. In addition, PLS will continue to work closely with its current and prospective business associates to improve the retail offtake rate and margin of downstream durian products by offshore wholesalers and end consumers. Concurrently, upstream investment in durian plantation will continue to be a mainstay of PLS to complement its existing downstream business while waiting for PLS's durian farm to mature and bearing fruits in 3 to 4 years time.

# Group Executive Chairman's Statement

# STRATEGIC REVIEW (CONT'D)

PLS has also entered into various cash crops joint ventures for the purpose of intercropping with cash crops, durian and other plantations. We have set our sight in the durian business as this is an industry waiting to be harnessed as it is in the midst of transformation from being a small stakeholder business to a commercialised industry. There are proper plans and foundations being laid to enhance this area of business and provide fruitful returns to the Group in the medium to long term horizon. This is in line with the long-term Group Strategy to expand and diversified into other businesses to reduce dependency and reliance on our existing businesses in construction and property development.

To strengthen the achievement of the company strategy as mentioned above, on 27 September 2023, in my personal capacity as a major shareholder of Ekovest, I have served a letter of proposal to convey my intention to undertake a reorganisation, rationalisation and merger proposal to transform the enlarged Ekovest Group into a listed public-private-partnership conglomerate in Malaysia, with interests in construction, property development, infrastructure and plantations. My proposals are intended to streamline the businesses and to consolidate the assets, resources, capabilities and core strengths of the respective companies in order to strengthen the performance, competitiveness and sustainability of the enlarged conglomerate, which I believe will create value for the all shareholders.

Furthermore, the proposals are aimed at mitigating any potential conflict of interest and it is my goal to share the economic propositions and benefits that I have for my business assets with all, including minority shareholders. In issuing this letter, I am seeking to be completely transparent with the Board of Directors relating to my intention and vision for Ekovest and for the Board to consider the proposal, and if thought fit, to implement them. The enlarged conglomerate through Ekovest post completion of the various proposed corporate exercises will have a stronger financial position, assets portfolio, vast strategic landbank as well as the skill and expertise required to compete both locally and internationally.

The Company on 27 October 2023 has signed the two (2) Binding Term Sheets, Heads of Merger Agreement and Head of Agreement on the above proposals, the parties had requested for an extension of time to assess, evaluate and deliberate the respective proposals in detail and to discuss and negotiate on the terms of the Definitive Agreement. The details of the respective proposals are table on page 210.

# MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION

# Construction

# Delivering Infrastructure Milestone

Despite all the challenges faced in FYE2024, especially challenges in the construction supply chain resulting in unpredictable fluctuation material prices and tight labour market post COVID-19, the remaining sections of the SPE was completed with the issuance of the certificate of practical completion and subsequently the Sijil Kesempurnaan Pembinaan Lebuhraya (SKPL). The SPE was fully opened to public on 3 November 2023 with tolling commencing on 3 December 2024.

Construction have always been the forte of our company and we expect this to remain the same in the years to come. We had delivered more than RM8.5 billion worth of construction projects to clients all across Malaysia and pride ourselves for being one of the most respected construction players in Malaysia.

Looking forward, the RM1.45 billion engineering, procurement and construction contract for the RTS Link project has enabled the Group to replenish its construction order book and this is expected to contribute positively to the financial performance of the Group up to three (3) financial years. Upon the completion of these high-impact infrastructure projects, it will mark another milestone of the projects that we have been trusted with and delivered for the nation.

We still believe that the current infrastructure development model adopted by the Government of Malaysia via Private Public Partnership (PPP) is still relevant and will help accelerate future infrastructure needs in Malaysia. In addition, we are pursuing and actively looking for new opportunities, including the DUKE Phase 2A, and to secure more infrastructure projects to replenish our construction orderbook.

# Property Development and Property Investment

# (Mall / Hotel)

Our property development division will continue the sales of the remainder completed residential units at EkoCheras after obtaining approval for the release of unsold "Bumiputera" allocated units. In addition, we have finalised the financial requirement and the authorities' submission for the launch of the upcoming new property development, the EkoTitiwangsa project by December 2024. EkoTitiwangsa consists of one office tower and two blocks of service apartments and has an estimated GDV of RM500 million to cater for lifestyle and spending habits post pandemic. We will continue to explore the right opportunities to monetise our other landbanks which will contribute to both the property development and construction segment simultaneously.

Our EkoCheras Mall have continued its road to recovery past pandemic where we were faced with tough decision and

had to discontinue or terminate some tenants. In prior years, rebate assistance were given to the tenants. In the current situation, we had always been very accommodative and supportive towards our tenants to ensure their business is able to recover into normalcy after a long period of uncertainty during the pandemic, we have never failed to support our tenants in various other forms too. The management remains very optimistic on the long-term performance of the mall.

Our EkoCheras integrated development comprises a mall, a hotel, an office tower and three blocks of serviced apartments have been fully completed with the final opening of the hotel operations. We have appointed Spain's largest hotel chain, Meliá Hotels International, as the operator of the 238-room hotel at EkoCheras. The Innside by Meliá has opened its doors to the public since March 2023.

Overall, we believe that the entire EkoCheras development is able to offer an affordable yet comfortable experience and will be the nucleus of Cheras. We hope that EkoCheras will be able to open up more growth opportunities and rejuvenate Cheras as a whole.

# Infrastructure Concession

# Long Term Asset In Greater Kuala Lumpur

Our infrastructure concession and toll operation division (i.e. the operation and management of the DUKE 1 & 2 toll concession) has recovered well and traffic volumes have exceeded the pre-pandemic levels and trend is expected to continue. The full opening of the SPE on 3 November 2023 have also increase the toll revenue for the Group. However, the lasting impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, especially on the cashflow and overall financial commitment we have to our sukukholders. The best opportunity for toll collection during the pandemic have created a huge financial gap when projected and actual toll collection. Nonetheless, we remain positive to be able to all principal and profit payment, as and when due, but require the support and patience

of all stakeholders to recover and realign our financial obligations. We are also in the midst of

discussion with our SPE sukukholders and the Government to ensure that the financial obligations of the SPE is resolved to ensure the long-term financial stability of the project. Our industry peers have also continued with the engagement with the Government to highlight the severity of the reduced traffic volume resulting from the MCO implemented to the overall business model as well as to the liquidity and cashflow position of all concessionaires in Malaysia. Any adverse impact to the toll industry will have a ripple-effect to the capital markets whereby there are more than RM60.0 billion of outstanding debt and/or sukuk raised by the industry.

We have always focused to ensure the comfort of road users remain at a high level to entice them to utilise our alternative highway network. We are also ensuring that the long-term maintenance of the expressway is kept within the standards set by the Malaysian Highway Authority (MHA).

The full opening of the SPE on 3 November 2023 and also the opening of the Sungai Besi – Ulu Kelang Elevated Expressway (SUKE) together with the Damansara – Shah Alam Elevated Expressway (DASH) have further enhanced the entire road network in Greater Kuala Lumpur. This is especially important for us as the seamless integration between our DUKE and these expressways will provide the impetus required for increased traffic volumes utilising our DUKE.

Nevertheless, the long-term prospect and value of the DUKE and the SPE is still present as the seamless connectivity it provides will see it become an important road link and network for Greater Kuala Lumpur. The long concession period which we have for this urban highway also provide flexibility for potential future monetisation and value enhancements.

# Strengthening Presence in Agriculture & Agrofood

PLS, a leading player in the agro-food industry, their implementation of the business strategy and transformation plan is in a transition phase. In addition to diversifying

the business into different cash crops, PLS is also building distribution channels and diversifying into downstream products, specifically into durian consumer products. The rolling out of their Agropreneur Programme, an Integrated Agrotech Park and collaboration with both the Federal and

State Government and ecosystem partners will be the backbone to strengthening their role in the local agro-food ecology and network. PLS has also sets its sights on refining its approach to the Chinese market as their previous strategy of direct selling to China, primarily through exports, encountered challenges. PLS is recalibrating to form collaborations with renowned players in China's wholesale and retail sectors instead of the earlier direct selling strategy. PLS is currently engaged in discussions with multiple stakeholders to enhance its access to the Chinese market. The aim of this collaboration is to align interests and foster sustainable growth for PLS, allowing PLS to maintain its core expertise in planting, sourcing and downstream processing. Barring unforeseen circumstances and the favourable commodity prices, we expect this division to contribute positively in the coming years.

The total revenue reported for FYE2024 is RM1.147 billion, which is an increase of approximately  $2.7\%$  as compared to previous year. Tabulation on the revenue for the Ekovest Group in FYE2024 and FYE2023 is as below:-

The increase in the current financial year revenue as compared to FYE2023 was mainly contributed by the increase in construction work done during the year due to more construction activities undertaken during this financial year. The higher construction revenue is mainly attributable to RTS Link project in this current financial year 2024 and also the finalisation of workdone from SPE project.

Notwithstanding the overall increase in revenue, we had reported increase in revenue in other divisions, mainly by the increase in traffic volume and toll revenue from the DUKE as well as higher revenue from the property investment division as well. The increase in the property investment segment is primarily attributed to lower rental rebates granted to tenants at EkoCheras Shopping Mall. In addition, the newly opened Innside by Melia Hotel in EkoCheras which has commenced the hotel operations in the last quarter of FYE2023 and had contributed positively to the financial performance of this division.

Our infrastructure concession division registered a revenue of RM310.8 million in FYE2024 as compared to RM287.7 million in FYE2023 supported by the increase in traffic volume utilising the DUKE highway. The revenue recorded in FYE2023 includes the toll compensation for calendar year 2020 and 2021 amounting to RM74.5 million, as compared to FYE2024 which recorded the toll compensation for calendar year 2022 of RM57.6 million. By excluding the toll compensation, the actual FYE2024 vs FYE2023 toll collection receipts, there is an increase of approximately  $18.8\%$  in the toll revenue, largely due to the increase in toll collections from the opening of the new SPE Highway on 3 November 2023.

The plantation division registered a lower revenue of RM114.9 million and a segment loss of RM11.5 million in FYE2024 as compared with the revenue of RM118.3 million and a segment loss of RM32.2 million in FYE2023. The decline in revenue and earnings can be attributed to moderated crude palm oil prices, inflationary pressures on operational costs, and the lingering effects of adverse weather on durian production where the volume and quality of durian plantation and contract farming activities were adversely affected by inclement weather condition. Furthermore, the challenges in the past year were compounded by an increase in maintenance activities as the labour supply began its recovery, coupled with a slower offtake of our downstream durian products by export customers.

# Management Discussion and Analysis

# Overview

# For Financial Year Ended 30 June 2024 (Cont'd)

The Group's total gross profit for FYE2024 has increased as compared to FYE2023 which is in tandem with the increase in total revenue. However, a higher loss before tax ("LBT") for FYE2024 was recorded at RM50.4 million as compared with the LBT reported in FYE2023 of RM9.9 million.

The higher loss before tax for YTD 2024 as compared to YTD 2023 is attributable to several factors. Firstly, upon the completion of the SPE in November 2023, the financing costs associated to the project can no longer be capitalised in the financial statements. Consequently, the Group's financing costs reflected in the Income Statement have risen from RM246.6 million in FYE2023 to RM380.8 million in FYE2024. Secondly, the Group has yet to receive the disbursement of toll compensation for year 2023 toll rate hike deferral estimated at RM64.0 million for Duke 1 & 2. Furthermore, the Group has not been able to recognise the scheduled toll rate for Duke 1 & 2, which was due on 1 January 2024. As for SPE highway, the Group is expecting some compensation from the government arising from the delays in project completion following changes in alignment and due to interfacing issues with other Government projects on site. All the above factors have significantly impacted the Group's financial results for FYE2024.

The Group reported a net loss after tax of RM118.2 million in FYE2024, this is mainly due to the recognition of deferred

tax liabilities for

the toll operations'

segment. The deferred tax

expense amounting to RM35.6 million mainly arising from our toll operations division had impacted the net loss after tax of the Group. This is mainly due to unrecognition of the deferred tax assets accumulated unabsorbed business losses pursuant to Section 44(5F) of the Income Tax Act (which the new law has imposed a 10-year limitation and can no longer carried forward indefinitely), as it not probable that the existing toll operation business would generate sufficient taxable profit within the next 10-year against which the deferred tax asset can be utilised.

From the balance sheet perspective, we have seen an increase in our Concession Assets from RM7.7 billion in FYE2023 to RM8.0 billion in the current year which is due to construction progress of the DUKE Phase 3. Correspondingly, there is a decrease in our Investment Funds, Short Term Deposits and Cash and Bank Balances from RM675.3 million in FYE2023 to RM482.6 million in FYE2024, which was due to funds utilised for the construction and financing requirements of DUKE Phase 3. Overall, our capital expenditure and working capital requirements were financed from internal generated cash as well as borrowings from financial institutions. Moving forward, we expect this strategy to remain largely intact and will continue to look for project financing structure to ensure the borrowings risk is "ring-fenced" and kept at project level.

We do acknowledge that some of the projects that we participate in, requires the support and financial capability of the Ekovest Group to be commercially viable. The gearing ratio of the Group remains low at 0.35 times for the FYE2024 vis-à-vis the gearing ratio of 0.37 times in FYE2023. For the calculation of the gearing ratio, we have excluded the Islamic Medium

Term Notes and Reimbursable Interest Assistance, which was issued to finance the construction of the DUKE highway. The slight decrease in the gearing ratio is due to repayment of our borrowings. The net assets per share attributable to equity holders as at FYE2024 had decrease to RM0.77 from RM0.86 in FYE2023, which is mainly due to the net loss recorded in FYE2024.

# ABOUT

# THIS STATEMENT

# Overview

This Statement outlines Ekovest Berhad and its subsidiaries' ("Ekovest" or "the Group") Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG") performance and initiatives for the financial period 1st July 2023 to 30th June 2024 ("FYE2024"). Due to the challenging financial conditions, we need to refocus on our core business to safeguard employee well-being while ensuring the interests of investors and shareholders are aligned and protected. Despite that, we strive to continue prioritising a balance between economic growth, environmental stewardship, and social responsibility, ensuring that our business contributes positively to the communities we serve while minimising our environmental impacts. While we understand the importance of setting targets, we believe more data are needed to establish realistic, measurable, and achievable ESG goals and targets aligned with industry benchmarks and our business strategy.

During this reporting year, we initiated our first direct engagement with stakeholders, focusing on key ESG issues. The insights gained from this process are detailed in the subsequent sections.

# Scope and Basis of Scope

As we pursue our goal of expanding the Group into a larger and more diverse conglomerate, our responsibilities for sustainability have continued to grow. Building on last year's efforts, our Sustainability Statement continues to cover the ESG performances of the Construction and Highway segments.

For the first time in our Sustainability Statements, our performance data of the Mall, Hotel and Property Development segments will be reported for FYE2024, unless otherwise specified.

Our ESG performance of the Plantation segment will be reported separately in PLS Plantations Berhad's Annual Report.

# Material ESG Matters

The Group strives to create long-term value for our stakeholders. We understand the importance of material ESG matters on financial growth, reduction of environmental impacts, and societal well-being. In order to align with the stakeholders' ESG expectations, we initiated a materiality assessment in FYE2024 by engaging the stakeholders via an E-survey to assess the ESG implications of our business activities.

As we have diverse business activities, our materiality assessment was carried out in stages by individual business segments with the respective stakeholders. In FYE2024, we have completed the materiality assessment for the Hotel and Highway business segments.

Our material ESG matters were identified and prioritised using a three-phase process aligned with Bursa's Sustainability Reporting Guide, as shown in the table below.

Environmental matters are becoming increasingly important to businesses worldwide as they become a focal point for investor expectations and regulatory compliance. As a diverse conglomerate with multiple lines of business, our management strategy primarily focuses on resource conservation and efficiency, which can be effectively streamlined across all our operations.

# Our Approach

With greenhouse gas emissions being the main driver of current environmental issues, we have taken measures to reduce energy consumption and machinery and equipment emissions, which are the main contributors to our emissions.

For our Construction segment, we ensure that all vehicles, plants, and equipment are maintained in good working condition to reduce wear and tear, which can increase air and noise pollution. In the Hotel segment, we have implemented various energy-saving initiatives, including installing motion-sensor lighting in public areas, decreasing the number of corridors lighting points, replacing car park and staircases lighting with radar sensor tube lights, and automated systems to reduce chilled water usage.

# Our Performance

In FYE2024, our total energy consumption, in the form of electricity, is 27,076.23 Megawatt, with a  $0.7\%$  increase from FYE2023. This increase is attributed to the additional input from the Hotel segment in FYE2024. We excluded the energy consumption of the Property Development segment as its energy consumption was limited to the sales gallery and was insignificant compared to the other business segments.

From FYE2023 to FYE2024, the Mall segment was the major contributor to the Group's energy consumption due to its high electricity usage within the mall compound.

We will continue to develop our energy efficiency initiatives in our operations. While we focus on our core business to protect employees and align investor interests, we believe that our initiatives' impact may yet to be evident in the short term.

KEY BUSINESS SEGMENT(S)

# Our Approach

As part of our efforts to streamline our management strategy across all business segments, our approach to emissions management primarily focuses on the efficient use of electricity, given its widespread application in most businesses. Additionally, data collection for Scope 2 emissions is more manageable due to the generally more accessible information. We are working towards collecting data for Scope 1 and Scope 3 emissions in the future.

# Our Performance

Our Scope 2 emissions are contributed by electricity usage, which have increased following the additional reporting of the Hotel segment in FYE2024. The Mall segment was the major contributor to the Group's Scope 2 emissions, as explained in the Energy Management section.

![](images/23b95d281389353478255b93568c83a7bfb53498097bb8fe8760169b062ba158.jpg)

# Our Approach

Water is an essential resource for all life on Earth, and its availability and quality significantly affect both ecosystems and human health. We believe that effect water management not only conserves valuable resources but also reduces costs and supports sustainable development. At Ekovest, we have prioritised our water management initiatives in two of our business segments that directly engage with customers, which are the Hotel and Mall segments.

For our Hotel segment, we have installed 238 water conservation devices in the shower and hand basin areas and collected approximately 100 to  $200\mathrm{m}^3$  of rainwater every quarter for use in garden landscaping and car park washing.

For our Mall segment, several measures have been implemented to improve water efficiency, such as replacing basin taps with push taps or automatic self-closing taps and reducing the speed of the domestic booster pump. Another step was tracking water loss, which allows for identifying and monitoring leaks or inefficiencies in the system. Besides that, we have also emphasised prompt repair of plumbing systems to prevent water wastage. To improve the durability and efficiency of the water distribution system, upgrading work is underway, including the replacement of PVC pipes with more durable PPR pipes. Finally, by optimising cooling towers through regular servicing, cleaning, and water treatment, these systems can operate efficiently, minimising unnecessary water usage while maintaining performance.

# Our Performance

Water consumption recorded has increased from FYE2023 to FYE2024 due to the addition of the data from the Hotel segment. The Mall segment was the largest consumer of water, as water supply to the tenants and customers is essential for the business operation. We expect some time before the results from our recently initiated water conservation initiatives become apparent.

We have decided to exclude the water usage of the Property Development segment as the water consumption was limited to the sales gallery and was insignificant.

ENVIRONMENTAL (CONT'D)

# Our Approach

Waste management is a key component of our sustainability efforts, as waste disposal has a direct impact on the environment. While we are still in the process of gathering data on waste management, we are committed to developing initiatives to improve our waste management practices.

In our Construction segment, we continue reducing, reusing and recycling waste at the construction sites and reusing on-site building materials such as reusable prefabricated formwork for columns, walls and slabs. We have implemented ISO 14001:2015 on Environmental Management System, the Environmental Monitoring and Measurement Control Plan and Environmental Impact Assessment to identify and mitigate environmental impacts for the projects undertaken.

In our Hotel segment, we have introduced recycling and food waste awareness programmes, in which the hotel staff has taken part in activities to promote awareness of food waste such as food leftovers like eggshells and fruit skin, which could be used for fertiliser composition.

By cultivating a diverse workforce and fostering an inclusive environment, we aim to empower our employees and create a workplace that reflects the rich diversity of the communities we serve. At Ekovest, we recognise our responsibility to the communities we operate in, and our strategic approach to social matters involves giving back to the society in meaningful ways.

# Our Approach

We remain committed to providing a healthy and safe working environment for our people and ensuring that our employees, suppliers, and contractors are well-equipped with knowledge of safety and health standard operating procedures.

In our Construction segment, The Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment, and Risk Control ("HIRARC") process is mandatory for all sites. The Site Safety and Health Committee regularly holds meetings to review the process and ensure timely communication and effective implementation. Additionally, the Committee is responsible for investigating major incidents reported and implementing appropriate remedial measures to address the root causes. We have enhanced the parapet wall design from precast to cast in situ and the use of the safety platform for casting the deck slab to overcome the risk of precast panel collapse. Besides, we applied the Construction Design and Management approach, which is a practice that embeds health and safety considerations during the project execution at the design stage.

Our commitment to health and safety goes beyond our employees and extends to our customers, whose well-being is our priority. In our Hotel segment, we have initiative assessments across all the product and service categories to identify and improve any potential health and safety impacts. Additionally, we strive to ensure full compliance with all relevant regulations and voluntary codes.

# Our Performance

We have maintained a record of no fatalities and lost time incidents in FYE2024. Additionally, we have conducted health and safety trainings for 156 employees in FYE2024 as follows.

# Our Approach

We highly value our employees' career growth and well-being; hence, we ensure that they are given fair treatment and opportunities to perform and showcase their talent. We prohibit and condemn inhumane practices such as forced labour, human trafficking, and modern slavery. Top management holds fortnightly engagement sessions with business heads and encourages similar engagement within their teams.

At Ekovest, employees' career progression is discussed with transparency based on their performance, allowing them to assume more responsibility and higher positions. Employee remuneration is assessed annually according to industry standards. Additionally, performance-based discretionary incentives are awarded to eligible employees based on their contributions to the Group.

Employees have the opportunity to enhance their skills and knowledge through formal and on-the-job training programmes, which are tailored to address their skill gaps, roles, and responsibilities.

# Our Approach

Diversity and inclusivity are pivotal to an organisation, where a diverse workforce can bring a variety of perspectives, ideas, and experiences, which leads to more creative and innovative solutions. Furthermore, prioritising diversity and inclusion attracts potential employees and enhances the organisation's reputation. We ensure that there is no discrimination against our employees based on race, age, gender, religion, marital status, ethnicity, physical impairments, political viewpoints, or nationality.

At Ekovest, diversity practices vary between business segments. The Construction and Highway segments generally feature a male-dominated workforce due to their job nature.

Melia Diversity Week, a programme conducted by our Hotel segment, was undertaken to raise awareness and promote a culture of diversity in the workplace by focusing on generational, cultural, gender, and sexual diversity. It seeks to bridge gaps between different age groups, such as Gen X, Millennials, and Gen Z, to enhance communication and understanding. The event also celebrates cultural differences within the organisation, fostering mutual respect and inclusion. Additionally, it emphasises empowering women and promoting gender equality to create a balanced and inclusive environment where everyone feels valued.

# Our Performance

In FYE2024, the employees gender composition of the Group was  $64\%$  male and  $36\%$  female, reflecting an increase in the male from  $61\%$  in FYE2023 and a corresponding decrease in female from  $39\%$ .

# Our Approach

As a Group, we strive to create a positive impact on the communities where we operate by organising various corporate social responsibility ("CSR") activities. Through these efforts, we have organised a range of CSR initiatives, majority from the Highway segment, aimed at promoting community spirit, enhancing health and safety, and fostering a sense of togetherness.

Our efforts to give back to society extend beyond environmental initiatives and include donations to a variety of organisations. We place a strong emphasis on providing financial support for school activities, as we believe that enhancing school programmes and creating more opportunities for students to thrive can contribute to the growth and development of the local community.

# Our Approach

Across the globe, demand for cybersecurity is increasing as data leaks and cyberattacks are of growing concern to organisations worldwide. These have the potential to cause economic and reputational losses for the organisations involved. This is particularly important for our Property Development segment, where critical customer data is collected as part of business operations.

At Ekovest, we strive to ensure strict policies, encryption, and employee training are conducted to protect our customers' data and to ensure there are zero breaches and compliance with data protection regulations such as the Personal Data Protection Act 2010.

# Our Performance

In FYE2024, we maintained our record of zero substantiated complaints regarding breaches of customer privacy or data loss.

This Corporate Governance ("CG") Overview Statement is presented in accordance with the requirements under Paragraph 15.25(1) and the provisions in the Practice Note 9 of the Main Market Listing Requirement ("MMLR"). The Statement highlights the applications of the key corporate governance practices of the Group during the financial year ended 30 June 2024.

In addition to this CG Overview Statement, the Board has provided detailed disclosures on the application of the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance practices in the Corporate Governance Report ("CG Report").

# PRINCIPLE A: BOARD LEADERSHIP AND EFFECTIVENESS

# (I) BOARD RESPONSIBILITIES

The Board acknowledges its principal responsibilities in overseeing management performance and corporate strategies, promoting sound governance and risk management, and ensuring effective succession planning, investor relations, and corporate reporting of the Group.

On March 6, 2024, the Managing Director transitioned to a Non-Executive Director role. This change allows the Executive Chairman to lead the board and management, supported by two dedicated Executive Directors, during this trying time for the Group. Nonetheless, to ensure a balanced approach to leadership, the Board continues to be composed of a majority of Independent Directors and includes various oversight committees, all chaired by Independent Directors. This structure enhances checks and balances in the decision-making process.

Furthermore, the Board appointed Mr. Lee Wai Kuen as the Senior Independent Director ("SID"), succeeding the former Chair of ARMC. Under this role, the SID will continue to serve as:

A supportive sounding board for the Chairman;  
A facilitator for communication among directors when necessary; and  
A valuable point of contact for shareholders and other stakeholders.

The Board is supported by two qualified and competent Company Secretaries, Mr. Lim Thiam Wah and Ms. Tee Lee Leng, both members of the Malaysian Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators. They provide guidance to the Board on regulatory compliance, relevant legislation, and best practices in corporate governance. The appointment and removal of the Company Secretaries are at the discretion of the Board.

The Board has formalised a Code of Conduct and Ethics ("the Code"), which outlines provisions on conflicts of interest, abuse of power, corruption, insider trading and money laundering. It also defines the expected actions and responsibilities of the Board, Management and staff in adhering to the Code.

The Board has established the Anti-Corruption and Bribery Policy, Whistleblowing Policy and reporting channel. The Whistleblowing and Anti-Corruption and Bribery Policies are available on the Company's website. To ensure confidentiality and protect the identity of the whistleblower, the Board has assigned the administration of the whistleblowing reporting channel to the Internal Auditor. During the financial period, the Board did not receive any complaints through the whistleblowing reporting channels.

The Board has established Board Committees, namely the Audit and Risk Management Committee, Nomination Committee and Remuneration Committee. The roles, duties and responsibilities of the Board Committees are defined in their terms of reference respectively. These Committees provide greater objectivity and independence in the deliberations of specific agendas and assist the Board in effectively discharging its duties and responsibilities.

# (III) SUSTAINABILITY

The Company's core sustainability values, initiatives and performance are communicated to all stakeholders through the Sustainability Statements in the Annual Report. The sustainability targets will be evaluated before they are set for the initiatives.

(Refer to further details Sustainability Statement in the Annual Report)

Going forward, the Group will set the sustainability target and timeline, and the Board and management's actions and responsibilities for achieving these targets. Upon completing this, the sustainability performance evaluation criteria will be defined for the Board and senior management appraisal.

# (IV) REMUNERATION

The remuneration policy defined in the Board Charter provides that all Executive Directors and Senior Management shall be remunerated based on the Group's and individual's performances, responsibilities and market conditions, whilst the Independent Director shall be remunerated based on their experience, level of responsibilities assumed in the Board Committees, the skills and expertise they bring to the Board.

# PRINCIPLE B: EFFECTIVE AUDIT AND RISK MANAGEMENT (CONT'D)

# (II) RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL

The Board is responsible for overall oversight of risk management in the Group, while the Executive Directors and senior management team are primarily responsible for managing risks in the Group.

Despite the Group has experienced steady growth in toll revenue from Duke 1 and 2, with the SPE's full opening in November 2023, the Group recorded a higher loss before tax in FYE 2024 compared to FYE 2023 and with a net current liability position similar to the previous year. The key reasons contributed to the loss are as follows:

i. Discontinuation of financing costs capitalisation for SPE Highway upon its commencement of operation in November 2023;  
ii. The compensation for the deferred toll rate hike for year 2023 had yet to be received for Duke 1 & 2; and  
iii. The Group has been unable to recognise the scheduled toll rate for Duke 1 & 2, which was due on 1 January 2024.

To address the above challenges and improve cash flow, the Group has:

- Taken steps such as private placements asset disposals, and managing financing costs by unlocking and securing new credit facilities;  
Identified strategic opportunities for property development and construction segments. A key project, the EkoTitiwangsa development, is expected to launch by December 2024 and enhance revenues in these segments;  
- The ongoing rationalisation of the RTS Link project and the construction of EkoTitiwangsa are expected to boost construction revenue further; and  
- PLS Plantations Berhad, a subsidiary, is transitioning from a cyclical oil palm business to a diversified model.

As part of its long-term risk management strategy, the Group plans to explore, expand and diversify into new business areas. The ultimate objective is to manage the cyclical nature and reduce reliance on its construction and property development sectors and the potential impact of unexpected events learning from the last pandemic.

The Board is satisfied that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing significant risks faced by the Group and that the existing internal control and risk management systems are adequate and effective to enable the Group to achieve its business objectives. The details of the Group's systems of risk management and internal control are reported in the Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control in this Annual Report.

The Internal Audit Function is outsourced to IA Essential Sdn Bhd, an internal audit consulting firm. The Internal Auditors have conducted their work with reference to the broad principles of the International Professional Practice Framework of the Institute of Internal Auditors. Besides reviewing the internal control systems, the Internal Auditor also assesses the governance, risk management and anti-corruption practices of the Group. The details of the internal audit function are disclosed in the ARMC Report in this Annual Report.

# Internal Control

The Board of Directors ("Board") of Ekovest Berhad is pleased to present its Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control for the financial year ended 30 June 2024. The disclosure in this Statement is presented pursuant to Paragraph 15.26(b) of the Main Market Listing Requirements ("MMLR") of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad ("Bursa Securities") and is guided by the Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control: Guidelines for Directors of Listed Issuers.

# BOARD'S RESPONSIBILITIES

The Board recognises its overall responsibility for risk management and understands the principal risks associated with the Group's six business segments, i.e. construction, property development, toll operation, plantation, food and beverages ("F&B") and property investment. The Board accepts that all business ventures require balancing risk, control costs, and shareholder returns.

The Board has established the Audit and Risk Management Committee ("ARMC") to support its oversight of the Group's risk management and internal control systems. The ARMC carries out its duties through the following procedures:

i. Reviewing the integrity of the interim financial results, annual report and audited financial statements in consultation with Management;  
ii. Evaluating the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal control systems based on the audit findings and timeliness of action taken by Management, reported by the Internal Auditors;  
iii. Seeking management clarification on business and operational issues as well as the measures taken by Management to mitigate and manage the business and operational challenges;  
iv. Studying the External Audit Memorandum on the annual audit findings and risk and control issues noted by them during their statutory audit; and  
v. Obtaining assurance from Management that the Group's risk management and internal control systems are adequate and effective in all material aspects.

# RISK MANAGEMENT

The Group's risk management continues to be driven by the Executive Directors and assisted by the Heads of Departments. They are responsible for identifying, assessing, monitoring and managing significant risks promptly and appropriately. They also assure the Board that the Group's risk management and internal control systems are adequate and effective.

Despite the Group has experienced steady growth in toll revenue from Duke 1 and 2, with the SPE's full opening in November 2023, the Group recorded a higher loss before tax in FYE 2024 compared to FYE 2023 and with a net current liability position similar to the previous year.

# INTERNAL CONTROLS

In addition to the risk management processes, the Group continues to maintain the following internal control systems and "check and balance" mechanisms:

- Clear delegation and separation of responsibilities between the Board and Management, the establishment of various Board Committees, and the inclusion of independent directors to oversee financial, compliance and operational performance;  
- A well-defined organisational structure that outlines lines of responsibility and hierarchy, covering key functions such as procurement, tenders, project management, legal administration, human resources, information systems and finance;  
- The Financial Assessment Committee ("FAC") and Technical Assessment Committee ("TAC") with a defined limit of approval for the evaluation and selection of tenders. These committees comprise Executive Board Members, Project Director, Head of Contract Department or Quantity Surveyor, Project Manager and a representative from the Finance Department;  
- Contract budgeting and the review and monitoring of these budgets, project performance and variances reports for the contract jobs by the Executive Directors;  
Insurance coverage to mitigate financial risk exposure from construction activities, fire, perils, consequential loss, burglary and public liability;  
- Implementation of ISO 9001:2015 on Quality Management System, ISO 14001: 2015 for Environmental Management System and ISO 45001:2018 for Occupational Health and Safety Management System; and  
- Establishment and enforcement of the anti-corruption framework, corporate code of conduct and ethics, and whistleblowing policy.

During the financial year, an Anti-Corruption and Whistleblowing Notification was sent to all active business partners in the construction, property development, toll operation and F&B segments through ekovest@whistleblower.com.my. This communication aimed to inform external stakeholders of the Group's Anti-Corruption & Bribery Policy and Whistleblowing Policy.

# Statement On Risk Management &Internal Control

# MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES AND ASSURANCE

In accordance with the Bursa Securities' Guidelines, Management is responsible for identifying risks; implementing and maintaining sound systems of risk management and internal control; and monitoring and reporting to the Board significant control deficiencies and changes in risks that could significantly affect the Group achievement of its objectives and performance.

In producing this Statement, the Board has received assurance from the Executive Directors and Chief Finance Officer that, to the best of their knowledge, the Group's risk management and internal control systems are operating adequately and effectively in all material aspects.

# BOARD ASSURANCE AND LIMITATION

This Statement is prepared under paragraph 15.26(b) of the Main Market Listing Requirements and guided by the "Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control - Guidelines for Directors of Listed Issuers" ("the Guidelines"), which was endorsed by the Bursa Securities.

The Board is satisfied that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing significant risks faced by the Group and that the existing internal control and risk management systems are adequate and effective in enabling the Group to achieve its business objectives. No material loss resulted from significant control weaknesses for the financial year under review.

The Board wishes to reiterate that risk management and internal control systems would be continuously improved in line with the evolving business environment. However, it should be noted that risk management and internal control systems are only designed to manage rather than eliminate risks of failure to achieve business objectives. Therefore, these systems can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatements, fraud and losses.

# REVIEW OF STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL BY EXTERNAL AUDITORS

# INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION

Para 15.27 of MMLR provides that a listed issuer must establish an internal audit function independent of the activities it audits and ensure it reports directly to the ARMC.

The Company has outsourced its internal audit function to an internal audit consulting firm. The audit team members are independent of the activities audited by them. The primary responsibility of this internal audit function is to assist the Board and the ARMC in reviewing and assessing the management systems of internal control and to provide recommendations to strengthen these internal control procedures.

The internal audit function is headed by a director and supported by a manager and audit executives. The Director in charge is Mr. Chong Kian Soon. Kian Soon is a member of Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, the Malaysian Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Institute of Internal Auditors Malaysia, while the team members are accounting graduates.

The Internal Auditors have carried out their work according to the principles of the International Professional Practice Framework of the Institute of Internal Auditors. These principles cover audit planning, execution, documentation, communication of findings, and consultation with key stakeholders.

The audit scope of work in the Internal Audit Plan is determined in consideration of the Group's structure, risks, ongoing and upcoming construction and property development projects, the segmental financial performance of the businesses in the Group, recurrent related party transactions and main market listing requirements and amendments. A new internal audit plan will be proposed and presented to the ARMC when appropriate for deliberation and approval before internal audit reviews are carried out.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and of the Company as at 30 June 2024, and of their financial performance and their cash flows for the financial year then ended in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards as issued by Malaysian Accounting Standards Board, IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.

# Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

# Independence and Other Ethical Responsibilities

We are independent of the Group and of the Company in accordance with the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, Conduct and Practice) of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants ("By-Laws") and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) ("IESBA Code"), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the By-Laws and the IESBA Code.

# Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

# (a) Amortisation and Impairment Assessment of Expressway Concession Assets

As at 30 June 2024, the Group's expressway concession assets amounted to RM8 billion, which represents approximately  $70\%$  of the Group's total assets. As disclosed in note 3.6 to the financial statements, the Group used projected traffic volume estimated by independent traffic consultant as a denominator to amortise the carrying amount of expressway concession assets over the concession period. The basis to arrive at the traffic volume projection take into consideration of the growth rate, and market and economic conditions. Management, together with the independent traffic consultant, exercise judgement when estimating the traffic volume in determining the amortisation of expressway concession assets.

Further, impairment assessment of expressway concession assets requires significant judgements and estimates on discount rate applied for the calculation of recoverable value and the assumptions used in the cash flow projections, including the projected traffic volume and forecast growth rates over the projection period.

There is a risk that the estimated traffic volume, growth rate, discount rate and cash flow projections may be significantly different from actual outcome, resulting in material variance in the calculated amortisation and recoverable amount of the expressway concession assets.

In view of the significance of the expressway concession assets, the level of judgement exercised by management and the estimation uncertainty, we identified amortisation and impairment assessment of expressway concession assets as key audit matters.

# Key Audit Matters (Cont'd)

# (a) Amortisation and Impairment Assessment of Expressway Concession Assets (Cont'd)

# Our response:

Our audit procedures included, among others, the following:

(i) We considered and assessed the independent traffic consultant's competency, capability and objectivity;  
(ii) We obtained an understanding of the methodology adopted by the independent traffic consultant in estimating the traffic volume;  
(iii) We assessed the reasonableness of the assumptions applied in determining the projected traffic volume;  
(iv) We assessed and challenged the reasonableness of key assumptions, including traffic volume projection, discount rate and growth rates used in cash flow projections for impairment assessment;  
(v) We tested the mathematical accuracy of amortisation amount and recoverable amount calculation; and  
(vi) We performed sensitivity analysis on the projected traffic volume and key assumptions used and assessed the impact to the carrying amount of expressway concession assets.

# (b) Valuation of Investment Properties

The Group's investment properties as at 30 June 2024 amounted to RM861 million.

The Group adopts fair value model for its investment properties. The fair value of the Group's investment properties was determined by management based on valuations performed by independent valuers. The fair value of the investment properties was determined by using investment and comparison methods.

The valuation process involves significant judgement in determining the appropriate valuation methodologies and the underlying assumptions. The valuations are highly sensitive to key assumptions applied and any change in the assumptions can have a significant impact to the valuations.

In view of the significance of the investment properties, the level of judgement exercised by management and the estimation uncertainty, we identified valuation of investment properties as a key audit matter.

# Our response:

Our audit procedures included, among others, the following:

(i) We considered and assessed the independent valuers' competency, capability and objectivity;  
(ii) We discussed and obtained an understanding of the methodologies and key assumptions adopted by the independent valuers in estimating the fair value of the investment properties;  
(iii) We assessed the reasonableness of key assumptions and inputs in the valuations under comparison method, including, where applicable, selling prices of recent transactions and historical transaction prices of similar properties of nearby location, any adjustments for tenure, location, development concept and size;

# (b) Valuation of Investment Properties (Cont'd)

# Our response: (Cont'd)

Our audit procedures included, among others, the following: (Cont'd)

(iv) We tested the reasonableness of rental income and rental periods applied in the valuation under investment method, by comparing them with signed tenancy agreements on sample basis; and  
(v) We tested and challenged the significant inputs applied in the valuations under investment method, such as market rental reversion, net projected operating costs, void allowance rate, projection of other income, yield rate, terminal yield rate by comparing them against historical data and available industry data for similar property types.

# (c) Revenue Recognition for Construction Contracts

For the financial year ended 30 June 2024, revenue generated from construction contracts amounted to RM657 million representing approximately  $57\%$  of the Group's total revenue. The Company's revenue from construction contracts amounted RM51 million for the same period, representing approximately  $49\%$  of the Company's total revenue.

Revenue from construction contracts is recognised over time, which requires management to exercise significant judgement in measuring the progress towards satisfaction of the performance obligations as stated in the contracts with customers.

The estimation of the percentage of completion requires significant judgement in estimating the total construction costs for each of the contracts. Other areas of estimation, including the obligations to contract variations, claim, cost contingencies and rebates.

There is a risk that the estimated revenue, cost or margins may be significantly different from the actual outcome, resulting in material variance in amount of revenue and/or profit recognised in the financial statements.

In the view of the significance of revenue from construction contracts recognised by the Group and by the Company, the level of judgement exercised by management and the estimation uncertainty, we identified revenue recognition for construction contracts as a key audit matter.

# Our response:

Our audit procedures included, among others, the following:

(i) We obtained understanding of the revenue recognition process and tested the operating effectiveness of the Group's internal controls relating to recognition of revenue and cost;  
(ii) We assessed the reasonableness of management's key assumptions used in the estimates for total construction costs for each of those projects, where applicable, examining documentary evidences such as signed letters of awards, approved variation orders, and performing retrospective review of the key estimates;  
(iii) We validated the contract revenue against the agreed customers' contracts;  
(iv) We recomputed management's computed percentage of completion after considering implications of identified errors (if any) or changes in estimates;

# (c) Revenue Recognition for Construction Contracts (Cont'd)

# Our response: (Cont'd)

Our audit procedures included, among others, the following: (Cont'd)

(v) We tested on sampling basis, actual cost incurred to relevant supporting documents such as contractors' claim certificates and suppliers' invoices. Where costs have not been billed or certified, we assessed the adequacy of accruals of such costs by reviewing subsequent contractors' claim certificates and suppliers' invoices; and  
(vi) We evaluated whether the Group or the Company is liable for liquidated ascertained damages by reviewing the contractual delivery dates of the signed agreements against the estimated delivery dates and latest progress reports.

# (d) Basis of Accounting Assessment

The financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the financial year ended 30 June 2024 have been prepared on a going concern basis. As at 30 June 2024, the Group and the Company reported net current liabilities position as disclosed in notes 3.1 and 56(c) to the financial statements.

This is considered a key audit matter because the evaluation of the basis of accounting involved management's significant judgement and estimation uncertainty. The management's judgement relates to their assessment of the appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting of the Group and of the Company with reference to the underlying assumptions and plans and the actions taken by management.

# Our response:

Our audit procedures included, among others, the following:

(i) We obtained an understanding of the Group's and the Company's business plan, including, but not limited to, their financial obligations, cash flow requirements, source of fund, the management's actions taken during and after the end of the financial year, and cash flows forecast and business plans for the next twelve months from the date of this report (and a longer period where applicable);  
(ii) We assessed and challenged the management's key assumptions that form the basis of their forecast and business plans to evaluate whether they are reasonably made in the circumstances; and we had considered the track records of the relevant businesses, current and future market conditions, and compliance with applicable covenants of borrowings;  
(iii) We assessed the audit procedures carried out by the component auditors and their conclusion concerning the going concern basis of accounting of a material subsidiary of the Group;  
(iv) We evaluated the reasonableness of the management's assessment that the Group and the Company are able to meet their financial obligations as and when they fall due at least in the next twelve months from the date of this report and the appropriateness of their going concern basis of accounting applied in the financial statements; and  
(v) We assessed the appropriateness and sufficiency of the management's disclosures in the financial statements in respect of the going concern basis of accounting of the Group and of the Company.

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT'D)

# Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditors' Report Thereon

The directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but does not include the financial statements of the Group and of the Company and our auditors' report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Statements

The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that give a true and fair view in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS Accounting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The directors are also responsible for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

# Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.  
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's and the Company's internal control.  
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.

# Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements (Cont'd)

As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: (Cont'd)

- Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's or the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.  
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.  
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements of the Group. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements

In accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia, we report that the subsidiaries of which we have not acted as auditors, are disclosed in note 13 to the financial statements.

# Other Matter

This report is made solely to the members of the Company, as a body, in accordance with Section 266 of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility to any other person for the content of this report.

FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024

# 1. GENERAL INFORMATION

Ekovest Berhad (the "Company") is a public company limited by shares incorporated and domiciled in Malaysia, and listed on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad. The addresses of the registered office and principal place of business of the Company are disclosed in page 6.

The principal activities of the Company are investment holding, civil engineering and building works. There have been no significant changes in the nature of these principal activities during the financial year.

The principal activities of the subsidiaries are disclosed in note 13 to the financial statements. The Company and its subsidiaries are referred to as the "Group" collectively.

# 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION

The financial statements of the Group and of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards ("MFRS") as issued by the Malaysian Accounting Standards Board ("MASB"), IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.

The financial statements are presented in Ringgit Malaysia ("RM"), which is also the Company's functional currency. All the amounts in the financial statements are rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise stated.

# (a) Application of new or amended standards

In the current financial year, the Group and the Company have applied the MFRS and Amendments to MFRSs that become effective mandatorily for the financial periods beginning on or after 1 July 2023.

The adoption of these MFRS and Amendments to MFRSs does not have significant impact on the financial statements of the Group and the Company.

The Group and the Company adopted amendments to MFRS 101, Presentation of Financial Statements since 1 July 2023. The amendments require the disclosure of material accounting policy information rather than significant accounting policies. Nevertheless, the amendments do not result in changes to the Group's and the Company's accounting policies.

# (b) New or amended standards issued that are not yet effective

The Group and the Company have not applied the following MFRS and amendments to MFRSs that have been issued by the MASB but are not yet effective.

The adoption of MFRS 18 will change certain presentation and disclosure in the financial statements. The Group is evaluating its impact and plan to adopt MFRS 18 when it is effectively mandatorily.

# 3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

# 3.1 Basis of accounting

The financial statements of the Group and the Company have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for other measurement bases applied, including fair value, as disclosed in the accounting policies below.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using a valuation technique.

For purpose of financial reporting, all assets and liabilities, for which fair value is measured or disclosed, are categorised within the fair value hierarchy set out below based on the inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement:

Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets (for identical assets or liabilities).

Level 2: Inputs (other than quoted prices included within Level 1) are observable either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).

Level 3: Valuation techniques that include unobservable inputs (not based on observable market data).

The financial statements of the Group and of the Company have been prepared on a going concern basis. This basis presumes that the business operations of the Group and of the Company will be sustainable in the foreseeable future and consequently, the realisation of assets and the settlement of liability will occur in the ordinary course of business. Further details are set out in note 56(c) to the financial statements.

# Notes to the

# Financial Statements

FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2024

# 3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)

# 3.2 Basis of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and of the entities controlled by the Company made up to the end of the financial year.

The Company controls an investee if and only if the Company has all the following:

(i) power over the investee;  
(ii) exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and  
(iii) the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor's returns.

The consolidated financial statements are prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances. All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation. Consolidation of an investee shall begin from the date the Company obtains control of the investee and cease when the investor loses control of the investee.

Non-controlling interests are the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests' share of subsequent changes in equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.

# Changes of interests in subsidiaries

The changes of interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are treated as equity transactions between the Group and non-controlling interest holders. Any gain or loss arising from equity transactions is recognised directly in equity.

# 3.3 Business combination

The Group accounts for each business combination by applying the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business combination shall be measured at fair value, which shall be calculated as the sum of the acquisition date fair values of the assets transferred by the acquirer, the liabilities incurred by the acquirer to former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the acquirer. Acquisition related costs are recognised as expenses when the costs are incurred.

On the date of acquisition, goodwill is measured as the excess of (i) over (ii) below:

(i) The aggregate of: (i) the fair value of consideration transferred; (ii) the amount of any non-controlling interests in the investee; and (iii) the fair value of the Group's previously held equity interest in the investee, if the business combination achieved in stages.  
(ii) The net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.

If, after reassessment, a business combination in which the amount in (ii) above exceeds the aggregate of the amounts in (i) above, the Group recognises the resulting gain in profit or loss.

# 3.4 Investments in associates and joint ventures

An associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint arrangement. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint control over those policies.

A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Joint control is the sharing of control of an arrangement contractually, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties.

Investments in associates or joint ventures are accounted for in the financial statements using the equity method. The results and net assets of associates or joint ventures are accounted using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances. An investment is accounted for using the equity method from the date on which the Group obtains significant influence or joint control until the date the Group ceases to have a significant influence or joint control. Under the equity method, the investments are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter for post-acquisition changes in the Group's share of net assets of the associates or joint ventures. Unrealised gains or losses on transactions between the Group and its associates or joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the associates or joint ventures.

# 3.5 Investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures (separate financial statements)

In the Company's separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are measured at cost less impairment losses, if any. Impairment losses are charged to profit or loss.

# 3.6 Concession assets

Concession assets are recognised to the extent that the Group has a right (a licence) to charge users of the public services.

Concession assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses. Amortisation of the concession assets begins when it is available for use, which means when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.

Expressway development expenditures ("EDE") is amortised over the concession period. The amortisation formula applied in the preparation of the financial statements to arrive at the annual amortisation charge for each financial year is as follows:

Traffic volume for the year

(Actual traffic volume for the year + Projected total traffic volume for the subsequent years to the end of the concession period)

(Net book value of EDE at the beginning of the year + Additions for the year)

The projected total traffic volume is based on the latest available base case traffic projection prepared by independent traffic consultants.

Upon completion of the construction works, the cost of park and ride building is amortised based on straight-line basis over remaining concession period.

# 3.7 Property, plant and equipment

# (i) Measurement basis

Property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Subsequent to initial recognition, property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.

Property, plant and equipment are derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. On disposal, the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the net carrying amount is recognised in the profit or loss.

# (ii) Depreciation

Freehold land and capital work-in-progress are not depreciated.

Depreciation is calculated to write off the depreciable amount of other property, plant and equipment on the straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Depreciable amount is determined after deducting the residual value from the cost.

The principal annual rates used for this purpose are:

<table><tr><td>Buildings</td><td>2% - 3%</td></tr><tr><td>Equipment, plant and machinery</td><td>4% - 20%</td></tr><tr><td>Motor vehicles</td><td>20%</td></tr><tr><td>Office equipment</td><td>10% - 33 1/3%</td></tr><tr><td>Furniture and fittings</td><td>10% - 20%</td></tr><tr><td>Renovation</td><td>2% - 20%</td></tr></table>

The residual values, useful lives and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period to ensure that the amount, method and period of depreciation are consistent with previous estimates and the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the items of property, plant and equipment.

# 3.8 Investment properties

Investment properties are properties held to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or both rather than for use in the production or supply of goods and services or for administrative purposes, or sale in the ordinary course of business.

Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are stated at fair value, which reflects market conditions at the end of reporting period. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair values of investment properties are recognised in the profit or loss in the year in which they arise.

# 3.9 Biological assets

Biological assets comprised of produce growing on bearer plants and other biological assets. Biological assets are measured at fair value less costs to sell. Any gain or losses arising from changes in the fair value less costs to sell are recognised in profit or loss.

Biological assets are classified as current assets for produce that are expected to be harvested and sold on a date not more than 12 months after the reporting date and the balance is classified as non-current.

# 3.10 Bearer plants

# Recognition and measurement

Bearer plants are living plants that are used in the supply of agriculture produce for more than one period and have remote likelihood of being sold as agriculture produce.

Bearer plants comprise pre-cropping costs incurred on land preparation, construction of drains, roads and irrigation, fertilisation, plant and planting, labour and any general overheads directly attributed to the development of the rootstock. Pre-cropping costs incurred are capitalised at cost and amortised over the useful life of the rootstock commencing from the date of maturity of the rootstock.

The carrying values of bearer plants are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at each financial year end to ensure that the amount method and period of amortisation are consistent with previous estimates and the expected pattern of consumption of the future benefits.

# Amortisation

Amortisation is recognised in the profit or loss on straight line basis commencing from the date of maturity over the mature period of the of each component of bearer plants at the following basis:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Life cycle</td><td>Immature period</td><td>Mature period</td></tr><tr><td>Oil palm</td><td>30 years</td><td>4 years</td><td>26 years</td></tr><tr><td>Durian trees</td><td>80 years</td><td>7 years</td><td>73 years or over the remaining mature period</td></tr><tr><td>Rubber trees</td><td>15 years</td><td>7 years</td><td>8 years</td></tr><tr><td>Pineapple trees</td><td>2 years</td><td>10 months</td><td>14 months</td></tr></table>

# 3.11 Leases

# The Group as Lessee

Right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities are recognised with respect to all lease agreements, except for short-term leases and leases of low value assets.

For short-term leases (i.e. leases with a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low value assets, lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

# 3.11 Leases (Cont'd)

# The Group as Lessee (Cont'd)

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the lease commencement date, discounted using the rate implicit in the lease or incremental borrowing rate, where applicable. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise: (i) fixed lease payments, less lease incentives; (ii) variable lease payments based upon an index or a rate; and (iii) payments of penalties for terminating the lease.

The right-of-use assets comprise the corresponding lease liability, lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date and initial direct costs. Whenever there is an obligation to dismantle and remove a leased asset, restore the site on which it is located or restore the underlying asset to the agreed condition, a provision is recognised. These costs are included in the related right-of-use assets.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. They are depreciated over the shorter period of lease term and useful life of the underlying assets. The estimated useful lives of the right-of-use assets are determined as follows:

<table><tr><td>Forest plantation project</td><td>30 to 60 years</td></tr><tr><td>Leasehold land</td><td>6 to 92 years</td></tr><tr><td>Motor vehicles</td><td>5 to 7 years</td></tr><tr><td>Office equipment</td><td>5 years</td></tr><tr><td>Plant and machinery</td><td>5 to 10 years</td></tr><tr><td>Buildings</td><td>1 to 10 years</td></tr><tr><td>Contract farming</td><td>3 to 6 years</td></tr><tr><td>Contract logging rights</td><td>Over lease term</td></tr></table>

# The Group as Lessor

Leases are classified as finance leases or operating leases. Whenever the lease transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Initial direct costs incurred are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

# 3.12 Intangible assets

Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units and is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. Impairment test is performed annually. Goodwill is also tested for impairment when indication of impairment exists. Impairment losses recognised are not reversed in subsequent periods.

# 3.13 Property development

Property development is classified under two categories i.e. land held for property development and property development costs.

# Land held for property development

Land held for property development is land on which development is not expected to be completed within the normal operating cycle. No significant development work would have been undertaken on the land. Land held for property development is measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

# Property development costs

Land on which development has commenced and is expected to be completed within the normal operating cycle is included in property development costs (current asset).

Property development costs comprise all costs that are directly attributable to development activities or that can be allocated on a reasonable basis to such activities. Property development costs are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and applicable selling expenses.

Property development costs attributable to sold units are subsequently recognised as an expense in profit or loss when or as the entity's performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time.

# 3.14 Performance deposits

Performance deposits are initially recognised as the advance net profit entitlement in respect of the Privatisation Agreement as stated in note 17. The performance deposits shall be set-off against future profit entitlement over the management period of 60 years.

Any outstanding balance of the performance deposits at the end of the 60 years management period that is not set off due to insufficient distributable profit shall be recognised to profit or loss.

# 3.15 Contract assets and contract liabilities

Contract assets are the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to customers. If goods or services are transferred to customers before the customers pay consideration or before payment is due, contract assets are recognised for the earned consideration that is conditional. Trade receivables represent the entity's right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional.

Contract liabilities are the obligation to transfer goods or services to customers for which the entity has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customers. If the customers pay consideration before the entity transfers goods or services to the customers, contract liabilities are recognised when the payment is made, or the payment is due (whichever is earlier).

# 3.16 Provision for heavy repairs

Heavy repairs relate to repair of bridges, slopes and embankments, rectification of settlements and pavement rehabilitation of medium and high traffic sections along the expressway.

Provision for heavy repairs, being the contractual obligations to maintain and restore the infrastructure to a specified standard of serviceability, is recognised and measured at the present value of estimated expenditures expected to be required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date.

# 3.17 Impairment of non-financial assets

# Goodwill

Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill may be impaired.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from synergies of the business combination.

An impairment loss is recognised when the carrying amount of a cash-generating unit, including the goodwill, exceeds the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit. Recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is the higher of the cash-generating unit's fair value less cost to sell and its value in use. The total impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of the allocated goodwill and then to the other assets in that cash-generating unit proportionately on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in that cash-generating unit. Impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.

# Property, plant and equipment, concession assets, bearer plants, forest plantation project, right-of-use assets and investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint venture

Property, plant and equipment, concession assets, bearer plants, forest plantation project, right-of-use assets and investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint venture are assessed at the end of each reporting period to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.

If such an indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less cost to sell and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the assets. Recoverable amounts are estimated for individual assets or, if it is not possible, for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.

Any reversal of an impairment loss as a result of a subsequent increase in recoverable amount should not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortisation or depreciation, if applicable) had no impairment loss been previously recognised for the asset.

# 3.18 Inventories

Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less costs to completion and selling expenses.

# 3.19 Financial instruments

A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when an entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of an instrument.

Financial assets (with the exception of trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component) and financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities on initial recognition. A trade receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at its transaction price.

# Financial assets

All recognised financial assets are subsequently measured in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value, depending on the classification of the financial assets. Financial assets are measured subsequently in the following manners:

- at amortised cost (debt instruments);  
- at fair value through other comprehensive income ("FVTOCI"), with recycling of cumulative gains and losses (debt instruments);  
- designated at FVTOCI, without recycling of cumulative gains and losses (equity instruments); or  
- at fair value through profit or loss ("FVTPL").

# Financial assets at amortised cost

Debt instruments that meet the following conditions are subsequently measured at amortised cost:

- the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and  
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

Financial assets at amortised cost are subsequently measured using the effective interest method and are subject to impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when an asset is derecognised, modified or impaired.

# Financial assets at FVTPL

Financial assets that do not meet the criteria for being measured at amortised cost or FVTOCI are measured at FVTPL, including but not limited to:

- Debt instruments that are designated as at FVTPL, if such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognising the gains and losses on them on different bases.  
Derivative instruments.

# 3.19 Financial instruments (Cont'd)

# Financial assets at FVTPL (Cont'd)

Financial assets at FVTPL are measured at fair value, with fair value gains or losses recognised in profit or loss to the extent they are not part of a designated hedging relationship. The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss includes any dividend or interest earned on the financial assets.

# Impairment of financial assets

Loss allowance is recognised for expected credit losses ("ECL") for all debt instruments not held at FVTPL, i.e. financial assets at amortised cost or FVTOCI, receivables, lease receivables, contract assets, loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts.

ECL is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that are expected to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms. The amount of ECL is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the respective financial asset.

Management measures the loss allowance of trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables at an amount equal to their lifetime ECL (i.e. simplified approach). The ECL on these financial assets are estimated based on historical credit loss experience, and where appropriate, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment.

For all other financial assets at amortised cost, where credit exposures for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, ECL is provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date. For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in the likelihood or risk of a default occurring since initial recognition (instead of on evidence of a financial asset being credit-impaired at the reporting date or an actual default occurring), a loss allowance is required for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the financial assets.

The Group considers a financial asset to be in default when contractual payments are more than 90 days past due, unless there is reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a more lagging default criterion is more appropriate. The Group also considers a financial asset in default when there is a breach of financial covenants by the debtor; or when there is indication that the debtor is unlikely to settle its indebtedness to the Group in full, without considering any collaterals held by the Group.

# Derecognition of financial assets

A financial asset is derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire; or when the financial asset is transferred and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred to another party.

If the entity neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control a transferred financial asset, the entity recognises its retained interest in the financial asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the entity retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the entity continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.

On derecognition of a financial asset measured at amortised cost, the difference between the financial asset's carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable is recognised in profit or loss. On derecognition of an investment in a debt instrument classified as at FVTOCI, the cumulative gain or loss previously accumulated in the reserve is reclassified to profit or loss. On derecognition of an investment in equity instrument classified at FVTOCI, the cumulative gain or loss previously accumulated in the reserve is transferred to retained earnings.

# 3.19 Financial instruments (Cont'd)

# Financial liabilities and equity instruments

Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.

# Financial liabilities

All financial liabilities are subsequently measured at FVTPL or at amortised cost.

# Financial liabilities at amortised cost

These financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

# Effective interest method

The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a debt instrument or a financial liability by allocating interest income/expense over the relevant periods. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts/payments (including all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of a debt instrument or a financial liability, to the amortised cost of the debt instrument or the financial liability.

# Financial guarantee contracts

A financial guarantee contract is a contract that requires the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument.

Financial guarantee contracts issued are initially measured at their fair values and, if not designated as at FVTPL and do not arise from a transfer of a financial asset, are subsequently measured at the higher of:

- the loss allowance determined in accordance with MFRS 9; and  
the amount recognised initially less, where appropriate, cumulative amount of income recognised.

# Derecognition of financial liabilities

Financial liabilities are derecognised when, and only when, the obligations under the liabilities are discharged, cancelled or expired. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised and the consideration paid and payable, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in profit or loss.

When an existing financial liability is replaced by another financial liability from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability.

# Equity instrument

Equity instruments issued are recognised at the proceeds received. Costs incurred directly attributable to the issuance of the equity instruments are accounted for as a deduction from equity.

# 3.20 Revenue and other income recognition

Revenue from a contract with a customer is recognised when control of the goods or services are transferred to the customer. Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring the goods or services to the customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties.

If a contract with a customer contains more than one performance obligation, the total consideration is allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative stand-alone selling prices of the goods or services promised in the contract.

# Construction contracts and property development

Revenue is recognised over time, if (i) the entity creates an asset with no alternative use to the entity and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to-date; or (ii) a customer controls the asset as it is created or enhanced by the entity.

Revenue is recognised over the period of the contract by measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation. Revenue is measured on the basis of the entity's efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of a performance obligation relative to the total expected inputs to the satisfaction of that performance obligation. The stage of completion is determined by the proportion of contract costs incurred to-date relative to the estimated total contract costs.

Revenue from sales of completed properties is recognised when the control of the properties is transferred to the buyers.

# Toll revenue

Toll revenue is accounted for as and when toll is chargeable for the usage of the expressway.

# Toll compensation

Pursuant to Concession Agreement, the Government of Malaysia ("Government") reserves the right to restructure or to restrict the imposition of unit toll rate increases, and in such event, the Government shall compensate the Group for any deduction in toll revenue, subject to negotiation and other considerations that the Government may deem fit. Toll compensation for any concession year is recognised in the financial statements as revenue when recovery is probable and the amount that is recoverable can be measured reliably.

# Sales of goods

Revenue from sales of food and beverages and plantation products and produces is recognised at the point in time when control of the goods is transferred to a customer, generally upon delivery of goods.

In measuring the revenue for the sales of goods, the effects of variable consideration, the existence of significant financing component, non-cash consideration, and consideration payable to the customer, etc. are taken into consideration.

Other revenue is recognised as follows:

- Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.

Other income is recognised as follows:

- Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method.

# 3.21 Employee benefits

# (i) Short term employee benefits

Salaries, wages, bonuses, allowances, paid annual leave and paid sick leave are recognised as an expense in the period in which the services are rendered by employees.

# (ii) Defined contribution plan

As required by law, companies in Malaysia make contributions to the Employees Provident Fund ("EPF"). Such contributions are recognised as an expense in the profit or loss in the period to which they relate.

# 3.22 Borrowing costs

Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset shall be capitalised as part of the cost of that asset.

A qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale. Unsold work-in-progress (inventories) which is ready for its intended sale in its current condition, contract assets and financial assets are not a qualifying asset.

Capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when the activities to prepare the asset for its intended use or sale are in progress and the expenditures and borrowing costs are incurred. Capitalisation of borrowing costs ceases when the asset is ready for its intended use or sale; or during extended periods when active development of the asset is suspended.

All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the financial period in which they are incurred.

# 3.23 Income tax

The income tax expense represents the aggregate of current tax and deferred tax.

Current tax and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss. Current tax and deferred tax are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, if the tax relates to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. Where deferred tax arises from a business combination, the tax effect is included in the accounting for the business combination.

# Current tax

Current tax is the expected income tax payable on the taxable profit for the year, estimated using the tax rates enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date.

A provision is recognised for those matters for which the tax determination is uncertain, but it is considered probable that there will be a future payment to a tax authority. The provisions are measured at the best estimate of the amount expected to become payable.

# Deferred tax

Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.

A deferred tax liability is recognised for all taxable temporary differences. A deferred tax asset is only recognised for deductible temporary differences and unutilised tax credit to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available in future against which the deductible temporary differences and unutilised tax credit can be utilised.

No deferred tax is recognised for temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of: (i) goodwill, or (ii) an asset or liability (which is not in a business combination) at the time of the transaction that affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit.

Deferred taxes are measured based on tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the asset or liability is expected to be recovered or settled and based on the tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date that are expected to apply to the financial period when the asset is realised or when the liability is settled.

# 3.24 Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and bank balances, bank overdrafts and other short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.

For the purpose of the statements of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents are presented net of bank overdrafts and designated bank account pledged.

# 3.25 Segment reporting

Segment revenue, expense, assets and liabilities are those amounts resulting from operating activities of a segment that are directly attributable to the segment and a relevant portion that can be allocated on a reasonable basis to the segment.

Segment revenue, expense, assets and liabilities are determined before intra-group balances and intra-group transactions are eliminated as part of the consolidation process, except to the extent that such intra-group balances and transactions are between group entities within a single segment.

Government grants shall not be recognised until there is reasonable assurance that: (a) the Group will comply with the conditions attaching to them; and (b) the grants will be received.

Government grants (recognised as deferred income) shall be recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the financial periods in which the Group recognises as expenses the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate.

A government grant that becomes receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred or for the purpose of giving immediate financial support to the Group with no future related costs shall be recognised in profit or loss in the financial period in which it becomes receivable.

# 3.28 Foreign currencies

# Transactions and balances in foreign currencies

Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency ("foreign currencies") are recognised at the prevailing exchange rate on the date of the transaction. At the reporting date, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the prevailing exchange rate on that date.

Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss, except for:

- Exchange differences on borrowings denominated in foreign currency relating to an asset under construction, which are included in the cost of that asset when the exchange difference is regarded as an adjustment to interest costs on those foreign currency borrowings.  
- Exchange differences on amounts receivable from or payable to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future (i.e. form part of the net investment in that foreign operation), which are recognised initially in other comprehensive income and reclassified from equity to profit or loss on disposal or partial disposal of the net investment.

# Translation of foreign operations

For consolidation purposes, all assets and liabilities of foreign operations (including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition of a foreign operation) are translated at the prevailing exchange rate on the reporting date. Income and expense are translated at average exchange rate for the financial period. Exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of the foreign operation are recognised in other comprehensive income; accumulated in a separate component of equity and attributed to non-controlling interests as appropriate.

On disposal of a foreign operation (i.e. loss of control, joint control or significant influence), the accumulated exchange differences recognised in equity relating to that foreign operation is reclassified to profit or loss.

# 3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT'D)

# 3.29 Earnings per share

Basic earnings per share ("EPS") is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Group by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.

Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.

# 4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in the process of applying the accounting policies. It also requires the use of accounting estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities (if any) at the end of the reporting period and reported amounts of income and expenses during the financial year.

Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions, historical experience and various other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the financial period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.

The key judgement and assumptions concerning the future and other key sources associated with estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are as follows:

# Revenue recognition of construction contracts

The Group and the Company recognise revenue from construction contracts over time based on method. The percentage of completion of the construction contracts is measured in accordance with the accounting policies set out in note 3.20.

Significant judgement is required in determining the percentage of completion, the extent of the contract costs incurred, the estimated total revenue and total costs and the recoverability of the contract. In making these judgements, management relies on past experience and their knowledge.

# Depreciation of property, plant and equipment and bearer plants

The Group and the Company review the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment and bearer plants at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful lives of property, plant and equipment and bearer plants could impact future depreciation charges.

# Impairment of property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and bearer plants

Property, plant and equipment, right-of-use-assets and bearer plants are assessed at the end of each reporting period to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If such an indication exists, an estimation of the recoverable amount is required. Estimating the recoverable amount (based on value in use) requires management to make an estimate of the future cash flows from the property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and bearer plants or the related cash generating unit and the discount rate.

# 4. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES (CONT'D)

# Fair value of investment properties

The Group and the Company measure their investment properties at fair value with any change in fair value recognised in the profit or loss. Significant judgement is required in the determination of fair value which may be derived based on different valuation methods. In making the judgement, the Group and the Company evaluate based on past experience and reliance on the work of specialists. The Group and the Company engage independent professional valuers to determine the fair value using comparison and investment methods.

The valuation methodology commonly used is the comparison method which is based on comparable historical transactions adjusted for specific market factors such as selling prices of recent transactions, historical transaction prices of similar properties of nearby location, any adjustments for tenure, location, development concept and size. The investment method involves the projection of a series of cash flows on a real property interest. To this projected cash flow series, an appropriate, market-derived discount rate is applied to establish the present value of the income stream associated with the real property.

# Amortisation and impairment of concession assets

The carrying amount of concession assets is amortised over the concession period by applying the formula in note 3.6. The denominator of the formula includes projected total traffic volume for subsequent years to the end of the concession period and is based on the traffic volume projection prepared by independent traffic consultants. The assumptions to arrive at the traffic volume projection take into consideration the growth rate based on market and economic conditions. Changes in the expected traffic volume could impact future amortisation charges.

The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indicator that the concession assets are impaired. If such an indication exists, an estimation of the recoverable amount is required. Estimating the recoverable amount requires management to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows generated from the concession assets discounted at a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.

# Measurement of inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The Group estimates the net realisable value of inventories based on an assessment of expected selling prices.

Inventories are reviewed on a regular basis and the Group will write down the inventories based primarily on historical trends and management estimates of expected and future product demand and related pricing.

Demand levels, changes in product preference and pricing competition could change from time to time. If such factors result in an adverse effect on the Group's inventories, the Group might be required to reduce the value of its inventories and additional write down for slow-moving inventories may be required.

# Measurement of land held for property development

Land held for property development is stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. The Group estimates the net realisable value of land held for property development based on assessment of expected market prices for similar land, less estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

Land held for property development is reviewed on a regular basis and the Group will write down its carrying amount primarily based on historical trends and management estimates of expected and future demand and related pricing.

# Measurement of impairment loss on investments in subsidiaries

Investments in subsidiaries are assessed at the end of each reporting period to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If such an indication exists, an estimation of the investment's recoverable amount is required. Estimating the recoverable amount requires management to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the Company's investments in subsidiaries and also choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.

# Deferred tax assets

Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences, unabsorbed capital allowances and unutilised tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available in future against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilised.

Significant management judgement, is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies.

# Determining the loss allowance for trade receivables and contract assets

Management assesses the ECL for trade receivables and contract assets at each reporting date. Credit losses are the difference between the contractual cash flows that are due to the entity and the cash flows that it actually expects to receive. Management applies simplified approach of MFRS 9 Financial Instruments in assessing the impairment of trade receivables and contract assets.

In determining the ECL, management uses historical credit loss experience for trade receivables and contract assets to estimate the ECL. Management is not only required to consider historical information that is adjusted to reflect the effects of current conditions and information that provides objective evidence that trade receivables and contract assets are impaired in relation to incurred losses, but management is also considering, when applicable, reasonable and supportable information that may include forecasts of future economic conditions when estimating the ECL, on an individual and collective basis. The need to consider forward-looking information means that management exercises considerable judgement as to how changes in macroeconomic factors will affect the ECL on trade receivables and contract assets.

The ECL on trade receivables and contract assets as at current reporting date is primarily mainly based upon the historical credit loss experience.

# Determining the loss allowance for non-trade receivables

Management assesses the ECL of receivables (other than trade receivables and contract assets) at each reporting date. Credit losses are the difference between the contractual cash flows that are due to the entity and the cash flows that it actually expects to receive.

In determining the ECL, management assesses whether there has been any significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition of a receivable. Where there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, management determines the loss allowance by estimating an amount equal to 12-month ECL of that receivable. For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in the likelihood or risk of a default occurring since initial recognition (instead of on evidence of a financial asset being credit-impaired at the reporting date or an actual default occurring), management measures a loss allowance for credit losses expected over the remaining life of that receivable. Management exercises considerable judgement in these estimations, using historical credit loss experience as well as reasonable and supportable information that may include forecasts of future economic conditions when estimating the ECL.

# Provision for heavy repairs

Provision for heavy repairs is recognised based on the future heavy repairs expenditure expected to be incurred over the concession period. Judgement and estimation are involved in determining the timing and amounts of future expenditure taking into consideration factors such as usage of expressway, technology changes, inflation and etc.

# Income taxes

Significant judgement is involved in determining the capital allowances and deductibility of expenses during the estimation of the provision for income tax. There are certain transactions and computations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business.

The Group and the Company recognise liabilities for expected tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recognised, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.

The Group's food and beverage operations was impacted by increased intense competition and changes in market demand. The Group has identified each restaurant outlet as cash generating unit ("CGU") which comprised plant and equipment and right-of-use assets.

The Group has performed the impairment assessment and has recognised an impairment loss of RM1,300,000 (2023: RM200,000) for the financial year ended 30 June 2024.

In the impairment assessment, the Group determined the recoverable amount of the assets based on discounted future cash flows derived from the sales of fresh durian based on the remaining lease period of the CLFAs. In determining the VIU calculation, the key assumptions used are as follows:

- Cash flow projections were prepared based on past experience, actual and future expected operating results for durian plantation;  
- Estimated a stable selling price annually for each type of durian species based on historical past year data and current market selling price;  
- Estimated the yield of production based on the key assumptions including fruit weight, grade, species, number of mature durian trees and mortality rate in accordance with management's experience based on the existing condition of the plantation; and  
A pre-tax discount rate of  $13.21\%$  (2023:  $9\%$ ) per annum.

# GFTSB and GFASB

# Impairment Testing on Park and Ride Building

During the financial year, as a result of deferment of commencement of park and ride operation, the Group performed an impairment assessment of the carrying amount of the park and ride building by comparing the discounted future cash flows attributable to the park and ride building against the carrying amount.

In the financial year ended 30 June 2024, the Group assessed recoverable amount to be approximate the underlying net carrying amounts, and accordingly no impairment loss recognised.

# Impairment Testing on Park and Ride Building (Cont'd)

In the previous financial years, the recoverable amount of park and ride building is lower than the carrying amount, led to the recognition of an impairment loss of RM9,147,000 in profit or loss.

The recoverable amount of park and ride building is determined based on a value-in-use calculation, using cash flow projection from financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year period.

Key assumptions used for value-in-use calculation for park and ride building are as follows:

<table><tr><td></td><td>2024</td><td>2023</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-tax discount rate</td><td>6.0%</td><td>8.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Revenue growth rate</td><td>10.0%</td><td>5.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Terminal growth rate</td><td>3.0%</td><td>1.4%</td></tr></table>

The sensitivity of the impairment assessment to a reasonably possible change in each of the key inputs is as follows:

<table><tr><td>2024</td><td>Change in assumption, holding other inputs constant</td><td>Additional impairment loss RM</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-tax discount rate</td><td>Increased by 1 percentage point</td><td>4.0 million</td></tr><tr><td>Commencement of operation</td><td>Delayed by 1 year</td><td>1.4 million</td></tr><tr><td>Revenue growth rate</td><td>Decreased by 1 percentage point</td><td>0.4 million</td></tr><tr><td>2023</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Pre-tax discount rate</td><td>Increased by 1 percentage point</td><td>3.6 million</td></tr><tr><td>Commencement of operation</td><td>Delayed by 1 year</td><td>1.7 million</td></tr><tr><td>Revenue growth rate</td><td>Decreased by 1 percentage point</td><td>0.3 million</td></tr></table>

# (b) Impairment review

The Group performs impairment review on the carrying amount of bearer plants at each reporting date to assess whether there are any indications of impairment. When indication of impairment exist, the management assessed the recoverable amount of the respective CGU based on VIU using discounted cash flows projections.

# Rubber trees

An indirect subsidiary of the Company, Aramijaya has planted rubber trees in various estates commencing from year 2012.

The management had carried an impairment review of its rubber segment which had experienced indicators of impairment. Based on the review, it was found that certain areas of rubber planted in earlier years were not in favourable field conditions with considerable delays in achieving the appropriate girth, which adversely affected the financial performance of the rubber segment.

An assessment of recoverable amount had been prepared based on discounted future cash flows derived from the sales of logs and latex. In determining the VIU calculation, the key assumptions used are as follows:

- Projected future cash flows over the remaining life span of the rubber trees prior to harvesting;  
Average selling price for cuplump and log based on historical past years data and market selling price;  
Average cuplump production ranging from 700 to 4,400 (2023: 200 to 900) metrics tonnes per year; and  
A pre-tax discount rate of  $9.0\%$  (2023:  $9.0\%$ ) per annum.

In the financial year ended 30 June 2024, the Group assessed recoverable amount to be higher than the underlying net carrying amounts, and accordingly no impairment loss recognised.

In the previous financial years, the recoverable amount of the identified rubber site is lower than the carrying amount, led to the recognition of an impairment loss of RM1,820,000 in profit or loss.

The sensitivity of the impairment assessment to a reasonably possible change in each of the key inputs (i.e. logs' selling price decreased by  $3.5\%$ , cuplump's selling price decrease by  $10.0\%$  and yield of cuplump decreased by 1.9MT per Ha, respectively) would not cause the recoverable amount to differ materially as at 30 June 2024.

# Durian trees

An indirect subsidiary of the Company, Jasa Indahmas Sdn. Bhd. had completed the acquisition of the durian plantation, including the durian trees accounted as bearer plant.

In the impairment assessment, the management engaged an independent valuer to determine the recoverable amount of the asset based on a 50-year discounted future cash flows derived from the sales of fresh durian based on the remaining life span of the durian trees.

In determining the fair value less cost to sell calculation, the key assumptions used are as follows:

- Cash flow projections were prepared based on past experience, actual and future expected operating results for durian plantation;  
- Estimated the average selling price of each type of durian species based on historical past year data and current market selling price;

# (b) Impairment review (Cont'd)

# Durian trees (Cont'd)

In determining the fair value less cost to sell calculation, the key assumptions used are as follows: (Cont'd)

- Estimated the yield of production based on the key assumptions including fruit weight, grade, species, number of mature durian trees and mortality rate in accordance with management's experience based on the existing condition of the plantation; and  
A pre-tax discount rate of  $9.0\%$  (2023:  $6.1\%$ ) per annum.

Based on the impairment assessment, the recoverable amount of the durian trees CGU was estimated to be higher than the carrying amount of the assets, and accordingly no impairment loss was recognised in the financial year ended 30 June 2024 and 30 June 2023.

The Group believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which the recoverable amount of the CGU asset is based on would not cause the carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amounts.

(c) The bearer plants with a net carrying amount of RM5,460,000 (2023: RM5,489,000) have been pledged as security to secure term loan of the Group as disclosed in note 32.

The biological assets of the Group comprise of:

# (i) Acacia and Karas

Acacia and Karas represent the plants prior to harvest. In the current financial year, the fair value for Acacia and Karas were estimated by the Group using income method in arriving at the fair value. In the previous financial year, the fair value for Acacia and Karas were estimated by the Group through use of a registered valuer ("the Valuer") using the comparison and income methods in arriving at the fair value. The fair value of Acacia and Karas at the reporting date is measured at level 3 hierarchy. The Acacia and Karas are measured at cost on initial recognition and at the end of each reporting period at its fair value less cost to sell.

# (ii) Eucalyptus and Meranti

Eucalyptus and Meranti represent the plants prior to harvest at cost less accumulated impairment loss. The directors are of the view that the fair value of the Eucalyptus and Meranti plant cannot be measured reliably as these are mainly pre-cropping cost related.

# (iii) Durians

The fair value is represented by the present value of the net cash flows expected to be generated from the sale of durians.

The fair value of durians at reporting date is measured at level 3 hierarchy.

# (iv) FFB prior to harvest

The fair value is represented by the present value of the net cash flows expected to be generated from the sale of FFB.

The fair value of FFB at reporting date is measured at level 3 hierarchy.

# Impairment Loss on Investment in EPR

During the financial year, EPR incurred a loss of RM0.6 million (2023: RM10 million) and also as a result of deferment of commencement of park and ride operation, the Company performed an impairment assessment of the carrying amount of the investment in EPR by comparing the discounted future cash flows of the park and ride operation against the carrying amount.

In the financial year ended 30 June 2024, the Group assessed recoverable amount of investment in EPR to be higher than the underlying net carrying amounts, and accordingly no impairment loss recognised.

In the previous financial years, the recoverable amount of investment in EPR is lower than the carrying amount, led to the recognition of an impairment loss of RM14 million in profit or loss.

The recoverable amount of investment in EPR is determined based on a VIU calculation, using cash flow projection from financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year period. The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projection is  $10.5\%$  (2023: 11.1%).

Pursuant to the terms of the Privatisation Agreement dated 4 December 2002, the Group is required to pay YPJH a sum of RM2.5 million as security towards Aramijaya's performance in undertaking a major role in the proposed privatisation of forest plantation project ("performance deposits"), and a sum of RM5 million a year for the first ten years period commencing from the financial year ended 31 March 2003, being YPJH's minimum net profit entitlement.

In the event that the net profit entitlement payable to YPJH arising from its  $30\%$  equity participation is less than RM5 million in any of the first ten years period, YPJH shall be entitled to request from the subsidiary additional sum towards the performance deposit equivalent to the amount of the shortfall from the RM5 million payable. Accordingly, YPJH's minimum net profit entitlement for the first ten years period totalling RM50 million, inclusive of the deposit of RM2.5 million, have been recognised as performance deposits.

The minimum net profit entitlement of YPJH totalling RM50 million shall be recoverable by way of set-off against YPJH's future profit entitlement in respect of its  $30\%$  equity participation in the subsidiary over and above RM5 million in any financial year within the first ten years from the financial year ended 31 March 2003 and any profit entitlement of YPJH thereafter.

In the event that there is any outstanding balance of the performance deposit (including any additional sums added due to the shortfall from the RM5 million minimum net profit entitlement a year for the first ten years period) not set off due to insufficient profit entitlement at the end of the 60 years management period, YPJH shall not be required to refund the performance deposit (including any additional sums added) and the same shall be fully extinguished.

The YPJH's minimum net profit entitlement of RM50 million has been fully paid during the financial year ended 31 March 2015 mainly through cash payments and the issuance of redeemable convertible preference shares in the subsidiary.

# (a) The Josu proceedings

On 18 December 2002, PLS had terminated a sub-contractor, Josu Engineering Construction Sdn. Bhd. ("the Defendant"), for failure to complete certain sub-contracted works in accordance with the agreed schedule. The termination was accepted by the Defendant, and in accordance with the terms of the subcontract, PLS engaged other contractors to complete the said sub-contracted works.

On 6 August 2007, PLS filed a suit against the Defendant, claiming a sum of RM10,303,000 for damages incurred by PLS in completing the sub-contracted works. The Defendant is counter-claiming a sum of RM11,612,000 being damages allegedly suffered.

On 21 November 2012, PLS had filed an application to amend its writ and statement of claim to include a prayer for pre-judgment interests and was allowed by the High Court and the matter was fixed for full trial.

However, on 5 December 2012, both parties have entered into a Consent Order to refer the matter to an arbitrator for determination. The Arbitrator had decided based on the Interim Award on Liability dated 13 November 2017 ("Interim Award"), amongst others, that neither party is entitled to terminate the sub-contract and that PLS's termination of the sub-contract was wrongful and therefore not valid.

The hearing dates in respect of quantum have yet to be fixed. On 22 December 2017, an application to challenge had been made to High Court, Kuala Lumpur to refer questions of law arising from the Interim Award pursuant to Section 42 of the Arbitration Act 2005. On 23 September 2019 both the parties complete their oral submission.

On 27 November 2019, the learned Judicial Commissioner was inclined to agree with the Defendant and dismissed the PLS's application with costs subject to allocator fees. The learned Judicial Commissioner was of the view that the plaintiff's questions of law posed in its application were not within the context of section 42 of the Arbitration Act 2005 and had no merits.

On 26 November 2021, the following related appeals came up for hearing together before the Court of Appeal Construction Panel:

(i) the appeal against the High Court's dismissal of the Defendant's striking out application ("Josu's Appeal"). By way of brief background, the Defendant had filed an interlocutory application during the High Court proceeding to strike out PLS's application filed pursuant to Section 42 of the Arbitration Act 2005 to refer questions of law arising from the interim arbitral Award in question ("PLS's Substantive Application"). The said striking out application was dismissed by the learned Judicial Commissioner (as she then was) and the Defendant appealed against the same to the Court of Appeal i.e. Civil Appeal No. W-02(IM)(C)-1527-08/2019; and

# 53. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (CONT'D)

# (a) The Josu proceedings (Cont'd)

On 26 November 2021, the following related appeals came up for hearing together before the Court of Appeal Construction Panel: (Cont'd)

(ii) the appeal against the High Court's dismissal of PLS's Substantive Application ("PLS's Appeal") i.e. Civil Appeal No. W-02(C)(A)-2269-12/2019.

The Honorable Court allowed Josu's Appeal with costs, thus setting aside the decision of the learned Judicial Commissioner (as she then was). The Court of Appeal held, inter-alia, that the arbitration was conducted strictly pursuant to Section 24A of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964 and that the Arbitration Act 2005 has no application in a court-ordered arbitration. Therefore, the Court of Appeal agreed with the Defendant's contention that the High Court of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur lacked jurisdiction to hear PLS's Substantive Application filed therein.

Following therefrom, the Court of Appeal held that there was no basis to proceed with PLS's Appeal as the Defendant's application to strike out PLS's Substantive Application was allowed. PLS's Appeal was therefore dismissed with costs.

Arising from the Court of Appeal's decision on 26 November 2021 in allowing the Defendant striking out appeal and in turn, dismissing PLS's Substantive Appeal, PLS had instructed its solicitors to file an application for leave to appeal to the Federal Court against the said decision of the Court of Appeal.

PLS has been apprised by its solicitors that two (2) Notices of Motion were filed in the Federal Court on 27 December 2021 as follows:

(i) Application No. 08(f)-702-12/2021(W) - for leave to appeal against the said Court of Appeal's decision in allowing the Defendant Appeal to strike out PLS's substantive application filed before the High Court to refer questions of law arising from the interim arbitral award in question; and  
(ii) Application No. 08(f)-703-12/2021(W) - for leave to appeal against the Court of Appeal's decision in dismissing PLS's Appeal solely on the basis that Josu's Appeal was allowed and without hearing PLS's Appeal on its merits.

The Federal Court, having heard both parties on 26 June 2023 held that Application No. 08(f)-702-12/2021(W) and Application No. 08(f)-703-12/2021(W) failed to satisfy the thresholds of Section 96(a) of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964 and proceeded to dismiss the aforesaid applications with costs in favour of the Defendant.

The Group has consulted its solicitors on the next course of action in respect of the pending arbitration proceeding.

(b) Kuala Lumpur High Court Suit No.WA-22NCC-462-07/2024 between Golden Fresh Durian Sdn Bhd (Plaintiff) vs. Dulai Fruits Enterprise Sdn Bhd ("Dulai") (Defendant)

One of the subsidiaries, Dulai had received a Writ and Statement of Claim dated 12 July 2024 from Golden Fresh Durian Sdn Bhd ("GFDSB") for the claim of outstanding amount due to GFDSB of RM1,867,000 together with pre- and post-judgement interest of  $5\%$  per annum.

In reply, Dulai had filed a Memorandum of Appearance on 23 July 2024. The Defence was filed by 20 August 2024 and the Case Management for GFDSB application to enter Summary Judgement against Defendant on 19 September 2024. Dulai has filed its Affidavit in reply by 27 September 2024.

On 19 September 2024, the Court directed both parties to submit Affidavits and Written Submissions for the Plaintiff's Summary Judgement Application, with the Hearing scheduled for 29 October 2024.

The outstanding amount of RM1,867,000 has been recognised in the financial statements of the Group. The Group has not provided any provisions for the  $5\%$  pre- or post-judgement interest related to this litigation. Relying on the advice of the solicitors, the directors of the Company believe that Dulai has a fair chance of succeeding in its suit.

# (b) Fair values

# Financial assets and financial liabilities that are not measured at fair value

The fair value of medium-term notes of the Group and of the Company at the end of the financial year is approximately RM6,270 million and RM260 million (2023: RM5,996 million and RM273 million) respectively.

The fair value of RIA of the Group at the end of the financial year is approximately RM760 million (2023: RM760 million).

The carrying amounts of other financial assets and liabilities as at the end of the financial reporting period approximate or were at their fair values due to the relatively short-term maturity or the related interest rates are at/approximate market rate on these financial instruments.

The fair value of medium-term notes is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows at current market rate available for similar instrument, which is included within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The fair value of RIA represents outstanding principal balance as at reporting date, which is included within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

# 56. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES

The Group's and the Company's activities are exposed to a variety of financial risks, including interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risks, foreign currency risk and agricultural risk on biological assets. The Group's and the Company's overall financial risk management objective and policies are to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group and the Company and to create value and maximise returns to its shareholders.

Financial risk management is carried out through risk reviews, internal control systems, benchmarking the industry's best performance, insurance programmes and adherence to financial risk management policies.

The Group and the Company have been financing their operations mainly from internally generated funds, issuance of medium-term notes and bank borrowings. The Group and the Company do not find it necessary to enter into derivative transactions based on their current level of operations.

The management monitors the Group's and the Company's financial position closely with an objective to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group and the Company. There have been no significant changes on the Group's and the Company's exposure to financial risks from the previous year, other than those disclosed in this note. Also, there have been no changes to the Group's and the Company's risk management objectives, policies and processes since the previous financial year end.

# 56. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONT'D)

The Group's and the Company's management reviews and agrees on policies managing each of the financial risks and they are summarised as follows:

# (a) Interest rate risk

The Group and the Company are exposed to interest rate risk which is the risk that future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates.

Exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the Group's and the Company's interest-bearing borrowings and medium term note.

The Group's and the Company's policy is to borrow principally on a floating rate basis but to retain a proportion of fixed rate borrowings. The objective of a mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings is to reduce the impact of an upward change in interest rates while enabling benefits to be enjoyed if interest rates fall. The mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings are monitored so as to ensure that the Group's and the Company's financing costs are kept at the lowest possible. The Group and the Company do not generally hedge interest rate risks. Hedging of risk through the use of financial instruments may be adopted should its use result in significant cost savings. The Group and the Company have a policy to ensure that interest rates obtained are competitive.

A sensitivity analysis has been performed based on the outstanding floating rate bank borrowings of the Group and the Company as at 30 June 2024. If interest rates increase or decrease by 100 basis points with all other variable held constant, the Group's and the Company's profit after tax and equity would decrease or increase by RM6,241,000 and RM3,242,000 (2023: RM6,523,000 and RM3,667,000), respectively, as a result of higher or lower interest expense on these borrowings.

The sensitivity analysis is unrepresentative of the inherent interest rate risk as the year-end exposure does not reflect the exposure during the financial year.

# (b) Credit risk

Credit risk arises from the possibility that a counter party may be unable to meet the terms of a contract in which the Group and the Company have a gain position.

The entire financial assets and contract assets of the Group and the Company are exposed to credit risk.

# Trade receivables

The Group's and the Company's exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. The Group and the Company have credit risk policies in place to manage credit risk exposure. The risk is managed through the application of the Group's and the Company's credit management procedures which include regular monitoring and follow up procedures.

An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date to measure the ECL. The calculation reflects information that is available at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.

The Group and the Company carefully select the projects in which they intend to participate. The selection is based on criteria that are reviewed periodically to take into account developments in the market. The Group and the Company also manage their credit risk exposure by maintaining good business relationship with its customers and debtors. This approach has enabled the Group and the Company to manage their credit risk more effectively in addition to the above credit risk management procedures.

For other activities, the Group and the Company minimise and monitor their credit risks by dealing with credit worthy counterparties, setting credit limits on exposures, applying credit approval controls and obtaining collateral or security deposits where appropriate. Trade and financial receivables are monitored on an ongoing basis via group-wide management reporting procedures.

# Deposits and bank balances

The Group and the Company always deposit or invest their funds with licensed financial institutions. Management assessed and concluded that there is no significant increase in credit risk of deposits and bank balances.

# (c) Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group or the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations when they fall due. A significant increase in liquidity risk may affect the going concern of the Group and of the Company.

To manage and mitigate the liquidity risk, the Group's management seeks to ensure all business units within the Group maintain optimum levels of liquidity at all times, sufficient for their operating, investing and financing activities. Therefore, the management monitors the Group's operations actively to ensure that each business unit, through efficient working capital management (i.e. accounts receivable and accounts payable management), must be able to convert its assets into cash to meet all demands for payment as and when they fall due.

The management monitors the current ratio and gearing ratio of the Group and of the Company continuously. The management monitors and forecasts cash commitments; and monitors and maintains a level of cash and cash equivalents deemed adequate to finance the Group's operating and investing activities. Each business unit is required to submit cash flow forecast to the management periodically. Each business unit aims to ensure that projected cash inflows from operating and non-operating activities (including undrawn credit facilities) adequately cover funding requirements of operating and non-operating cash outflows. At a minimum, all projected short-term borrowings shall be covered by the projected cash inflows. The management closely monitors the debt maturities to ensure that the Group and the Company are able to meet their financial obligations as they fall due.

Other than the management actively manages the cash flows of the Group and of the Company, the management constantly looks for alternative sources of funds to meet its financial obligation and to finance its business operations. Other than cash generated from operating activities, the management also generate cash from realisation of the Group's and the Company's assets when necessary.

# (c) Liquidity risk (Cont'd)

Based on the directors' assessment, the net current liabilities position is mainly attributable to expressway concession, construction and property segments of the Group, while the plantation segment is financially self-sustainable. In the assessment of the Group's and of the Company's liquidity and going concern, the directors evaluated and considered the following events, plan and forecast of the Group and of the Company up to the date of approval of these financial statements:

1. Setiawangsa-Pantai Expressway ("SPE") was opened to motorists since November 2023, three years later than the original forecast due to delays in the project completion resulting from changes in alignment and the pandemic-induced restrictions. The thin liquidity position of the Group is partially caused by the tolling delay of SPE, which give rise to mismatch between cash inflows from toll collection and financial obligations under IMTN related to the construction of SPE. The directors have initiated discussion with the relevant financiers to restructure the IMTN issued by Lebuhraya Duke Fasa 3 Sdn Bhd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group. The Group is exploring and expecting some compensation from the Government arising from the delays.  
2. In February and July 2024, the Group entered into sale and purchase agreements with a related party, Airman Sdn Bhd, for the disposal of land for a total consideration of RM77 million. The deposit of RM18.4 million has been received during the current financial year and the remaining cash consideration of RM58.6 million is expected to receive during financial year ending 30 June 2025.  
3. In June 2024, the Group entered into sale and purchase agreement for the disposal of equipment for a total consideration RM72 million as disclosed in note 28 to the financial statements. The consideration has been received in October 2024.  
4. A new credit facility up to RM100 million has been obtained from a financial institution for the working capital purpose, which is expected to drawdown in full during the financial year ending 30 June 2025.  
5. Based on the track record and covenant assessment of the existing credit facilities, the directors foresee the revolving credits of the Group and of the Company amounted to RM300 million and RM295 million respective as at 30 June 2024 will be rolled forward by the lenders at the request of the Group and of the Company for a period not less than twelve months after the date of approval of these financial statements.  
6. The Group has unutilised credit facilities up to RM1.22 billion as at the date of approval of these financial statements, including RM1.02 billion from its RM1.30 billion Sukuk Murabahah Programme.  
7. The projected net cash inflows from the Group's expressway concession, construction, and property segments for twelve months following the date of approval of these financial statements are achievable. The cash inflows from operations, including, but not limited to:

(a) An upcoming new property development project, EkoTitiwangsa, to be launched by December 2024 with an estimated gross development value of RM500 million.  
(b) The Group expects to receive expressways toll compensation for year 2023 estimated at RM64 million in respect of phases 1 and 2 of Duta-Ulu Kelang Expressway (“DUKE”).  
(c) Progress claims from RTS Link Project.  
(d) Toll collections from DUKE and SPE.

8. In order to further strengthen the financial position of the Group and to stay focused on its core businesses, the management is exploring opportunities to dispose of non-core assets of the Group. In view of the increasing demand for real estate in Johor, the management plans to monetise a few identified lands in the region.

# (c) Liquidity risk (Cont'd)

Considering aforesaid events, plan and forecast, as well as advances from the major shareholder up to the date of approval of these financial statements, the directors of the Company are of the view that the liquidity position of the Group and of the Company is manageable and they do not foresee any significant liquidity risk or material uncertainty exist that may cast doubt about the Group's and the Company's ability to meet their financial obligations for at least twelve months after the date of approval of these financial statements. Accordingly, the directors also concluded that there is no material uncertainty exist as at the date of approval of these financial statements which may cast significant doubt on the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern respectively in the foreseeable future.

The table below summarised issued financial guarantee contracts of the Company, which represent the maximum amounts of the guarantees, and is allocated to the earliest period in which the guarantees could be called.

# (d) Foreign currency risk

The Group undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Consequently, the Group is exposed to risk arising from fluctuation of exchange rates.

The Group does not consider it necessary to hedge against the foreign currency exchange risk based on its current level of operations.

The following table illustrates the Group's sensitivity to changes in exchange rate of RM against the relevant currencies on the material outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items. Management has considered recent volatility in exchange rates and has concluded that the following movements in exchange rates are reasonably possible assumption. If the following foreign currencies were to strengthen by  $5\%$  against RM with all other variables held constant, the Group's profit after tax and equity would decrease or increase as follows:

(i) On 3 July 2018, Ekovest Construction Sdn Bhd ("ECSB"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of our Company, had initiated an arbitration proceeding against Saraworks Sdn Bhd (previously known as Samling Resources Sdn Bhd) ("SSB") by serving a Notice of Arbitration on SSB. Thereafter, ECSB had on 2 July 2019 filed a Statement of Case to claim against SSB based on the following:

(a) ‘wrongful termination of the joint venture and shareholders’ agreement dated 6 January 2017 entered into between ECSB and SSB (“JV Agreement”) to jointly undertake the development and upgrading of the Pan Borneo Highway in the state of Sarawak, Malaysia for work package contract WPC-02 (Semantan to Sg. Moyan Bridge + KSR Interchanges) (“Highway Project”);  
(b) misrepresentation by SSB to ECSB, in order to induce ECSB into performing tasks, duties and responsibilities of SSB prior to the submission of the tender; the procurement of the Highway Project from Lebuhraya Borneo Utara Sdn Bhd ("LBUSB"), the project delivery partner for the Highway Project; and managing the Highway Project and all its ensuing duties and tasks;  
(c) failure to expeditiously and diligently make the necessary applications for the approvals from LBUSB for the sub-contract of the Highway Project to Samling – Ekovest JV Sdn Bhd, a special purpose vehicle incorporated by ECSB and SSB to undertake the development and upgrading of the Highway Project (“JV Company”); and  
(d) in the alternative, failure to take any step to compel LBUSB to consent to the sub-contract of the Highway Project to the JV Company, which should not have been unreasonably withheld, in which ECSB claims for general damages, interest and costs to be determined by the arbitrator ("Arbitration Proceedings").

(b) breach of duty of care, fiduciary duties, duties under common law and equity;  
(c) breach of the JV Agreement; and  
(d) breach of a collateral agreement between the parties.

ECSB had challenged the validity of the aforesaid notice on grounds that SSB's attempt to initiate this fresh arbitration tantamount to duplicity and is an abuse of process.

The parties reached a global settlement. On 12 May 2023, the parties, via a letter dated 12 May 2023 from the solicitors for ECSB to the Arbitrator in ECSB's arbitral proceedings, jointly sought the termination of the ECSB's arbitral proceedings.

(aa) were negligent in their representation and/or assurances with regards to the technical advice and support and profit margin for the Highway Project;  
(bb) failed, neglected and/or omitted to discharge their responsibilities with due care and diligence in the implementation and execution of the Highway Project;  
(cc) acted in breach of their fiduciary duties owed to SSB, including inter alia, the duties under common law and equity; and/or  
(dd) breached and misrepresented in respect of the sub-contractors that were selected, recommended and appointed to carry out the sub-contract works of the Highway Project.

SSB as plaintiff is claiming against our Company and ECSB as defendants jointly and severally for:

- general damages;  
- interest at the rate of  $5\%$  per annum pursuant to Section 11 of the Civil Law Act 1956 or at such rate and from such date as the court deems fit and proper until the date of judgement;  
interest at the rate of  $5 \%$  per annum from the date of judgement until the date of full and final settlement;  
costs; and  
such further and/or other relief as the court deems fit and proper.

ECSB and our Company had on 13 February 2020 and 14 February 2020 respectively filed our/its application for a stay of proceedings of the Claim pending the Arbitration Proceeding ("Stay Applications"). During the case management held on 21 April 2020, the Deputy Registrar further directed parties to file their respective affidavit and submissions, and had fixed the hearing of the Stay Applications to be on 6 July 2020. The hearing of the Stay Applications was then adjourned to 13 July 2020. Further to the filing of the written submissions and reply submissions by the parties' solicitors, the parties' solicitors also submitted orally and addressed the High Court Judge's questions during the hearing fixed on 13 July 2020.

On 25 August 2020, the Company has filed its notice of appeal to appeal against the decision of the High Court that dismissed the Company's Stay Application ("Company's Appeal"), and ECSB had also filed its notice of appeal to appeal partly against the condition imposed by the High Court when allowing ECSB's Stay Application. The Company and ECSB were advised that the Company's Stay Application and also the ECSB's Stay Application should be allowed given that the matters to be decided in the aforementioned proceedings are one of the same and that any contradiction in the decisions arising therefrom would unfairly prejudice one party's claim against each other.

Notwithstanding the aforesaid, the Court of Appeal had on 25 November 2021 (after reading the parties' respective written submissions together with all relevant documents) (a) allowed ECSB's appeal and set aside the condition imposed by the High Court Judge that the arbitration between ECSB and SSB shall only proceed after the resolution of SSB's Claim against the Company at the Kuala Lumpur High Court ("Set Aside Decision"); and (b) dismissed the Company's Appeal as the Court of Appeal was of the view that the High Court proceedings between SSB and the Company could proceed.

On 16 July 2020, the High Court directed for the O.14A Application to be heard first before the amendment application filed by the GKCSB, and that parties are to comply with the directions for submissions.

Upon having heard the parties on their submissions, the High Court had on 3 September 2021 dismissed the O. 14A Application with cost to GKCSB. On 27 September 2021, SSB filed a Notice of Appeal in respect of the O. 14A Application. SSB had also filed a Notice of Application together with the Affidavit in Support for a stay of proceedings application ("Stay Application") on 22 October 2021 and 25 October 2021 respectively. In addition, SSB had on 20 December 2021 filed a Notice of Application for the recusal of the present judge from hearing and deciding on the action, and that the action be heard and decided by a different high court judge ("Recusal Application"). The High Court ordered that in the interest of justice, the Recusal Application shall be heard first. Accordingly, the hearing of this Recusal Application is fixed on 22 March 2022.

Upon hearing parties on 22 March 2022, the Court dismissed the Recusal Application (Encl. 137) with no order as to costs. The Defendant further filed a Stay Application (Encl. 163) in respect of the Recusal Application (Encl. 137). On 25 April 2022, the Court fixed a ruling date on 11 May 2022 to rule whether to hear the Stay Application for Order 14 (Encl. 126) or Stay Application for Recusal (Encl. 163) first both filed by the Defendant. The Court vacated the ruling date on 11 May 2022 and further fixed the same on 17 June 2022. On 17 June 2022, the Court ordered that the Stay Application for Recusal (Encl. 163) should be heard first.

Upon hearing parties on 21 July 2022 and noted the appeals for both the O. 14A Application and Recusal Application on 28 September 2022, the Court allowed the Stay Application for Recusal (Encl. 163) with no order as to costs for the interest of justice. The Court further fixed a further mention on 30 September 2022 to monitor the case.

On 30 September 2022, as the instant matter has been stayed pending disposal of the appeals filed by the Defendant and the hearing date of the appeals has yet to be confirmed by the Court of Appeal, the Court fixed a mention via e-review on 29 November 2022 to update the court on the status of the appeals.

On 29 November 2022, the Plaintiff had informed the Court that the hearing date of the appeals filed by the Defendant has been fixed on 23 June 2023. In the circumstances, the Court further fixed a mention by way of e-review on 26 June 2023 for parties to update the status of the matter.

On 12 May 2023, the Plaintiff has filed a Notice of Discontinuance dated 12 May 2023 wherein the Plaintiff wholly discontinues the instant action with no liberty to file afresh and with no order as to costs and the Defendant wholly discontinues its counterclaim against the Plaintiff with no liberty to file afresh and with no order as to costs and the Defendant also wholly discontinues its Third Party Notice against the Third Party (ECSB) with no liberty to file afresh and with no order as to costs.

In the circumstances, the instant suit is discontinued by parties.

On 29 July 2024, the Board had announced our wholly-owned subsidiaries EPSB and Temasek Megamas Sdn Bhd had entered into three additional SPAs with Airman for the disposal of four (4) parcels of land for a total cash consideration of RM9.818 million.

Airman is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lim Seong Hai Resources Sdn Bhd which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lim Seong Hai Holdings Sdn Bhd ("LSHHSB"). Tan Sri Datuk Seri Lim Keng Cheng ("TSDSLKC"), our Non-Independent and Non-Executive Director, is also a Director of Airman and the major shareholder and Director of LSHHSB. As such, the disposal is deemed a related party transaction.

As of the date of this report, certain conditions precedent of these five SPAs have not been fulfilled and therefore the sale of land has yet to be completed.
