# Dear Shareholders,

It gives me great pleasure to present to you Tenaga Nasional Berhad's (TNB) Integrated Annual Report for the year 2023.

# OVERVIEW

The year 2023 marked a significant turning point for the world with the declaration by the World Health Organization that COVID-19 was no longer considered a global health emergency. While the announcement in May provided some optimism that it would be the end of pandemic-related challenges, it was tempered with an equal measure of uncertainty and pessimism given persistent inflation and subsequent policy tightening. The macroeconomic environment was also impacted by the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. The escalation of geopolitical tensions, particularly in the Middle East, had put markets on high alert, contributing to the volatility of gas prices and adding layers of complexity to the global energy landscape still adjusting to the aftermath of the Russia-Ukraine war.

These headwinds have weighed on sentiment and growth prospects, with subdued economic figures being recorded in 2023 compared to the robust numbers produced during the immediate post-COVID years. Consequently, the International Monetary Fund has projected global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth to moderate to  $3.0\%$  in 2023, slowing from the  $3.5\%$  posted in 2022.

![](images/a30218f46508cd5d79dec13af3b7602134f4cb349bbdf1d6fb553cc38cd99144.jpg)

Domestically, Malaysia's economy mirrored the global narrative of moderated growth, as it recorded a GDP growth of  $3.7\%$  in 2023 following the strong  $8.7\%$  rebound in 2022. Despite the resilient domestic demand, Malaysia's growth was tempered by weak external demand, in line with the slower global economy.

On our part, TNB has continued to support Malaysia's economic growth. Our efforts are aligned with the Madani Economy Framework that was introduced by the government in 2023, which aims to restructure Malaysia's economy to elevate the nation towards becoming a leading Asian economy and to improve the quality of life of all Malaysians.

Meanwhile, Malaysia's electricity demand growth, which generally reflects the country's economic performance, posted a similar  $3.8\%$  year-on-year (YoY) growth in Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah, lower than the  $6.1\%$  YoY growth in the previous year. Growth was backed by healthy demand in both domestic and commercial segments, with YoY growth of  $5.5\%$  and  $9.9\%$ , respectively, reflecting Malaysia's robust domestic demand.

# OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

In 2023, our revenue saw an increase of  $4.3\%$  year-over-year, driven by a rise in electricity demand, but a decrease in EBITDA, which fell by  $10.5\%$  to RM18.6 billion, mainly due to a lower contribution from the generation business. In line with this, Profit After Tax decreased by  $26.8\%$  to RM2.6 billion, largely as a result of the volatility of global coal prices (accounted from stockpiled inventories).

Despite these challenges, we maintained our commitment to our dividend policy, which aims for a  $30\%$  to  $60\%$  payout ratio based on the reported Consolidated Net Profit Attributable to Shareholders After Minority Interest, excluding extraordinary and non-recurring items. Thus, the Board is pleased to declare a final single-tier dividend of 28.0 sen per share. Together with our interim dividend of 18.0 sen per share paid on 17 October 2023, this brings our total dividend for the financial year 2023 to 46.0 sen per share, matching the total dividend paid in FY2022. Consequently, the dividend payout ratio for FY2023 was higher at  $66.6\%$  of profit after tax and minority interests, compared to  $55.2\%$  in FY2022, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to delivering shareholder value.

# AT THE VANGUARD OF MALAYSIA'S ENERGY TRANSITION

The year 2023 entered the history books as the warmest year on record, a stark reminder of the impact of climate change exacerbated by the El Niño phenomenon. Domestically, we acknowledge that the nation was fortunate to be spared from the severe climate-related incidents that affected other parts of the world in 2023.

In fact, we witnessed the government ushering in a watershed year in terms of elevating its climate action ambitions by launching the Malaysia Energy Transition Outlook (METO) and the National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR), which helped to clarify Malaysia's vision for the Energy Transition.

While METO has detailed several possible future pathways for the development of a sustainable and cleaner energy system in Malaysia, the NETR focuses on actionable plans and the initiatives to gradually increase renewable energy (RE) to  $70\%$  of our country's total generation capacity by 2050, with the ultimate goal of accomplishing net zero emissions as early as 2050. However, here it is also worth noting that conventional power plants, including currently operating coal plants, will continue to be required in Malaysia at this stage, especially as the government seeks to balance energy security and reliability against energy generation cost considerations. In this context, the existing Imbalance Cost Pass-Through (ICPT) mechanism under the Incentive Based Regulation (IBR) framework will still be in effect to cater for the variability of fuel costs.

The NETR plays a crucial role in identifying and prioritising actions across the energy sector, with 10 flagship catalyst projects and initiatives grounded in six Energy Transition (ET) levers: Energy Efficiency (EE), RE, Hydrogen, Bioenergy, Green Mobility, and Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS). TNB has been entrusted with leading three of NETR's flagship projects: Large Scale Solar Parks, Hybrid Hydro-Floating Solar (HHFS), and the Co-firing of Hydrogen and Ammonia. We support other levers through partnerships with the private and public sector. This highlights the collaborative effort needed to combat climate change, pooling expertise and resources from various sectors to achieve shared objectives.

I am heartened to see the Management team working to effect change and leading the charge for the ET journey for both the nation and TNB. In 2023, we demonstrated thought leadership through the successful organisation of the Energy Transition Conference in August which gathered local and international experts, policymakers, and industry leaders to discuss and strategise on the future of the energy transition. The conference focused on three critical sectors impact by the ET, namely Power, Transport and cities, with Digitalisation and Data Infrastructure as the key enablers. The conference highlighted the opportunities and insights within each sector, serving as the ideal platform for intellectual and industry convergence. This collaboration across sectors has resulted in numerous agreements and partnerships aimed at accelerating the journey towards Energy Transition.

# CHAIRMAN'S LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

# Partnerships for Success

![](images/07b69d2df699445cf07e888f538b614cf71b0c93a06703eb6db6af65f11f3a9d.jpg)

At TNB, we recognise that the Energy Transition (ET) journey is a shared responsibility and would be impossible to achieve on the strength of just one company. With the growing sense of urgency to push ahead with this agenda, it is heartening to note that others are also acknowledging this and reaching out to collaborate in order to achieve this mutually beneficial goal. With this as the backdrop, TNB has continued to forge partnerships with like-minded organisations across our entire value chain, from our generation business, transmission and distribution network as well as retail to benefit our customers. We have also been particularly interested in nurturing nascent green technologies that hold great potential to boost the ET journey, as we recognise that these technologies will require incubation before becoming commercially viable.

Thus, in 2023, we have collaborated with numerous partners, including regional utilities, multi-nationals and some of our biggest Malaysian conglomerates to explore decarbonisation, interconnection, renewable energy solutions, electrification of the transportation sector and green technologies. We believe that this pathway of forging partnerships will continue to be a critical enabler to future-proof our business as we continue implementing our Reimagining TNB strategy and Energy Transition plan.

In addition, we will continue to strongly support initiatives that will elevate the energy literacy of our citizens as they too are important stakeholders. A better understanding of energy systems and the various impacts of energy transition will enable decision makers to make more informed decisions, which will hopefully lead to a brighter future for our planet.

Even as TNB forges ahead with the NETR's objectives, we will remain focused on strategic initiatives to enhance the flexibility and resilience of our transmission and distribution networks, embrace more sustainable generation and elevate customer service levels. We are also forging ahead with digitalisation initiatives, a key enabler to our energy transition journey, to enhance efficiency, sustainability and innovation within the organisation. As digitalisation expands, there is a need to step up our cybersecurity measures to safeguard the electricity assets as well as to ensure safe, secure and reliable operations. Guided by our Reimagining TNB strategy and Energy Transition Plan, we will continue to strongly support the country's transition towards a more sustainable and resilient energy future.

# SUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITIES

In building a Brighter Community, TNB focuses on community needs through our corporate social responsibility (CSR) programme that emphasises education, socioeconomic support, and environmental care. This year, we invested RM18.2 million in our CSR activities comprising the provision of educational opportunities, socioeconomic support and the upholding of our environmental commitments. In addition, we paid zakat amounting to RM40.4 million in 2023 across Peninsular Malaysia based on FY2022's aggregate income, in which a portion of the zakat returned to us in the form of wakalah was distributed through various programmes to ease the burden of targeted recipients.

Through Yayasan Tenaga Nasional, we continue to sponsor students at the higher education level, both locally and abroad, in the form of scholarships and convertible loans. For 2023, we contributed more than RM70 million to sponsor 3,397 students for their higher education. We also support the government's agenda to produce employable graduates and to grow Malaysia's own talent in the power and utility industry via Universiti Tenaga Nasional, TNB Integrated Learning Solution Sdn. Bhd. and TNB Research Sdn. Bhd. These institutions are preparing the future workforce for the Energy Transition through relevant training and capacity development, as well as conducting research & development into the latest technologies.

In terms of socioeconomic support, we continue to carry out our Homes for the Needy programme, including Program Baiti Jannati, launched in 2007, and Projek Mesra Rakyat, which began in 2012. Together, these initiatives have provided new or upgraded homes to more than 1,000 families. This year, we also provided 2,500 primary students from low-income families with school supplies and uniforms through the Program Ceria ke Sekolah, in addition to financial support of 11 primary schools across Peninsular Malaysia under our PINTAR School Adoption programme. In continuing our decades-long commitment to developing the sport of hockey in Malaysia, we have invested RM5.6 million to our TNB Thunderbolts programme which aims to develop and nurture high-potential youth hockey players from all over the nation.

This year, our environmental efforts are further enhanced with the commitment to an investment of RM1.48 million to foster eco-friendly practices, biodiversity conservation and community involvement in environmental stewardship. Our flagship project, MY Brighter Green programme, kicked off in September 2023 in conjunction with TNB's  $74^{\text{th}}$  anniversary and has seen a total of 78,100 trees planted across various locations throughout Malaysia. Additionally, TNB has electrified 108 vehicles within its fleet, aligning with its objective to replace  $30\%$  of its vehicles with electric vehicles (EVs) by 2030, showcasing a tangible shift towards a more sustainable corporate transport policy. We are also expanding the participation of local companies and vendors in our energy transition initiatives through various vendor engagement and development programmes. The ongoing Advanced Metering Infrastructure project is a great testament where we managed to develop a pool of capable local vendors, manufactures and installers to realise the target of smart meter installations nationwide while contributing to job creation and skill development for the nation.

# GOVERNANCE

In 2023, Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) made significant strides in enhancing its governance structures, with a pronounced emphasis on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) principles. I recognise Management's efforts in bolstering governance, especially in the ESG context as it underscores TNB's commitment to sustainability and responsible corporate conduct, aligning with expectations from stakeholders.

GOVERNANCE

We also formed a new Sustainability Division, headed by the Chief Sustainability Officer, with the key roles to ensure the effective deployment of our sustainability strategies

Among the notable initiatives undertaken by TNB this year included the enhancement of the roles and renaming of the Board Risk Committee (BRC) to the Board Sustainability and Risk Committee (BSRC) in August 2023, which will assist the Board of Directors in fulfilling its responsibilities by providing oversight of the implementation effectiveness of the Group's sustainability and risk management frameworks.

We also formed a new Sustainability Division, headed by the Chief Sustainability Officer, with the key roles to ensure the effective deployment of our sustainability strategies, thus helping us to meet our targets and strengthening sustainability governance across the Group.

# OUTLOOK

Looking ahead for Malaysia, economic growth is expected to track upwards to  $4 - 5\%$  in 2024, from the  $3.7\%$  recorded in 2023, driven by the recovery in exports and resilient domestic expenditure, according to Bank Negara Malaysia. Growth will be supported by a solid labour market, enhanced household spending and improvements in tourist arrivals. In addition, sustained investment activities propelled by ongoing multi-year projects in both the private and public sectors, as well as the execution of catalytic initiatives under national master plans provides further upside. Fuel prices are also expected to ease in 2024.

We see further upside for TNB going forward especially with the government's robust efforts to drive the decarbonisation agenda. With policies supporting the expanding adoption of EVs and EV infrastructure, EV sales are expected to more than double in 2024, according to forecasts made by the Malaysian Automotive Association. The other catalyst is Malaysia's growing prominence as a preferred destination for data centres which will drive the demand for renewable energy (RE). To support this, TNB has established the Green Lane Pathway programme to streamline the on-boarding process for data centres, expedite approvals and facilitate the smooth setting up of data centres in Malaysia. In addition, the government's plan to establish a regional green energy exchange bodes well for increased activity in RE export deals, in which we expect to be a key player.

We take cognisance of the latest development in the Sabah electricity supply industry in which, the Sabah state government through the Energy Commission of Sabah (ECoS) has officially taken over regulatory authority of the state's electricity supply in January 2024. TNB will continue to support the government through the 7-year transformation programme of Sabah Electricity Sdn. Bhd. into becoming a financially viable and sustainable utility, while simultaneously improving the state's power supply security and reliability.

For TNB, it will be a critical time as we enter the final year of Regulatory Period 3. I am confident that the Management team will put forward a responsible and prudent proposal for our submission for the RP4 which spans 2025-2027. In line with the Government's effort to rationalise various subsidies, coupled with the increase of

RE penetration in the system, TNB is also working closely with the Ministry of Energy Transition and Water Transformation and the Energy Commission towards a more cost-reflective electricity tariff that features a targeted subsidy mechanism.

As we move forward, TNB remains steadfast in its journey towards achieving the ambitious goals outlined in our revised Reimagining TNB 2.0 strategy, guided by our purpose to brighten lives through innovative and sustainable energy solutions towards a better world. Our proactive engagement in Malaysia's energy transition, strategic investments in infrastructure, and unwavering commitment to sustainability and customer satisfaction have positioned us well to navigate the challenges ahead.

# Dear Valued Shareholders of Tenaga Nasional Berhad:

2023 was an exciting year for Malaysia as the nation made a firm commitment to accelerate a responsible Energy Transition with TNB at the forefront in driving the country's aspiration to achieve Net Zero Carbon Emissions by 2050. We at TNB are resolute in supporting the growth of the nation by creating further value for all our stakeholders by leveraging new opportunities and realise the nation's sustainability ambitions for a better and brighter future.

# PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS

Malaysia's economy continue its growth trajectory in 2023 at a moderated pace of  $3.7\%$  compared to the robust  $8.7\%$  in 2022. The economic expansion was similarly reflected in the rise of Malaysia's electricity demand of  $3.8\%$  year-on-year (YOY) in Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah.

The increase in electricity demand directly contributed to TNB's top-line growth of  $4.3\%$  YOY in 2023, with revenue growing to RM53.07 billion. However, we recorded lower EBITDA and profit after tax (PAT) of RM18.6 billion and RM2.6 billion respectively, mainly due to the negative fuel margin. Our liquidity and cashflow position have improved significantly in 2023 as we recorded a  $56\%$  reduction in receivables, mainly through consistent cost recovery of Imbalance Cost Pass-Through (ICPT) as well as efforts made by TNB to improve our collection rate.

Operational excellence remains a cornerstone of our strategy, and we strive to ensure our infrastructure assets remain robust and available to serve our customers. We recorded a Transmission System Minutes of 0.48 minutes, while our Distribution System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) was 46.1 - which puts us on par with other global utilities. Our power plants recorded a solid  $83.3\%$  availability factor throughout 2023, a testament to the efforts of our employees in upholding world-class standards of operational excellence in the operation and maintenance of our electricity supply infrastructure.

With regards to the safety and well-being of our employees and contractors, our Loss Time Injury Frequency (LTIF) was 0.74, a slight improvement from the 0.82 recorded in 2022. In 2023, we recorded the unfortunate loss of four lives - three employees and one contractor. We understand the gravity of the situation and are taking all the necessary preventive measures to ensure the safety of everyone with the enforcement of Tenaga Safety Culture and Life Saving Rules.

On the customer front, our relentless pursuit of excellence has paid off, and in 2023, we achieved the highest recorded Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) score of  $88\%$ . This was in tandem with our excellent Customer Experience Index (CEI) scores of over  $90\%$  across all our physical and digital touchpoints. These are truly historic achievements for TNB, and we are proud to continue delivering exceptional service to our customers. These successes are driven by continuous enhancements in our communications, our proactive approach in issue resolution, and robust digitalisation initiatives that significantly elevate the customer experience.

# STRATEGY

Building upon the foundational vision of the Reimagining TNB strategy, our approach remains unwaveringly rooted in the Energy Transition (ET) Plan we set forth in 2022. Our transformational journey continue in 2023 when we refresh our Reimagining TNB 2.0 by structuring around three key strategic pillars. They function as the primary drivers in our shift from a fossil-based energy mix to cleaner, more sustainable energy sources. These three pillars are supported by six core enabling functions that include policy advocacy, which helps us to navigate the regulatory landscape that TNB operates in.

# Energy Sources

The inaugural ET Conference 2023 which was held in Malaysia from 28-29 August 2023, emerged as the largest gathering dedicated to energy transition in the region. Hosted by TNB, the conference attracted more than 4,000 delegates from over 16 countries and featured 68 conference speakers during the two days of insightful sessions. The conference became the launchpad for one of Malaysia's most important energy transition blueprints, namely the National Energy Transition Roadmap, which was launched by Malaysia's Prime Minister, YAB Dato' Seri Anwar bin Ibrahim.

With the world moving in unison towards achieving net zero targets, the conference focused on the future of energy, green mobility, sustainable cities, digitalisation and data infrastructure. The event developed into a unifying platform for thought leaders, experts, industry players, policymakers, and communities across the energy value chain to formulate collaborative efforts, solutions, strategies and policies to accelerate energy transition effectively and responsibly.

Our approach to transforming the energy generation landscape is three-fold: significantly increasing our renewable energy capacity, improving our carbon management, and a gradual reduction of our coal generation capacity. We own and operate 198 powers plants with an installed capacity of 16,283MW and we are cognisant of the need for us to decarbonise our generation fleet in a sustainable and responsible manner.

In the context of our domestic renewable energy (RE) capacity, we have continued to grow from strength to strength in the year under review. Domestically, we have seen increased generation at TNB Sepang, Selangor, which provided an uplift to earnings. We are happy to report that we received the Commercial Operations Date (COD) earlier than expected for the TNB Bukit Selambau Solar Dua asset under LSS4, which added 75MWp of operational solar asset at the end of 2023. More positive news were recorded when we successfully secured solar asset development rights amounting to 135MWp through the Corporate Green Power Programme (CGPP) under the New Enhanced Dispatch Arrangement framework, providing more revenue upside going forward.

As part of Malaysia's NETR, TNB is spearheading three key large-scale RE and clean technology initiatives, namely Centralised Large-Scale Solar (LSS) parks, Hybrid Hydro Floating Solar (HHFS), and hydrogen and ammonia co-firing projects. Collectively, these initiatives have the capability to deliver over 3,000MW of renewable energy capacity by 2040 of which around

![](images/d520d76389b307c661a50fb802af6eb7e57d16d22b1ec809ffd5c08fd2a22433.jpg)

2,500MW are from HHFS technology, while an additional 500MW are sourced from five different LSS parks. Under the HHFS, we plan to install up to 230MW capacity at the Temenggor and Chenderoh hydro plants by 2025. In Perak, we have embarked on exploring a potential partnership to develop a 100MW ground-mounted solar project. These projects are integral to TNB's ET Plan and are expected to generate significant RE capacity, foster greater participation in the development of the RE sector and contribute to the nation's goal of accelerating decarbonisation.

In our mission towards decarbonising conventional thermal plants in Malaysia, we recognise that one of the pathways identified is through Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS). As a key ET technology, CCS holds significant potential in decarbonising our generation capacity. Mindful of the technical and commercial challenges to achieve meaningful scale, we have entered into collaborations with leading domestic and international companies to explore the implementation of CCS technology in our thermal plants. A key component of the collaboration includes knowledge transfer with our engineers receiving specialised training to enhance their technical capabilities.

To further support our decarbonisation efforts, we are actively repowering existing plants with cleaner fuels, integrating green technology, and exploring the possibility of early retirement for coal plants domestically and internationally to ensure our operations are both efficient and reduce our environmental footprint. In 2023, we completed the disposal of our power generation assets in India, which included 1,650MW of coal generation. This divestment aligns with our intention to gradually reduce our coal generation capacity.

In 2023, we successfully made inroads into the Australian RE market through the acquisition of Spark Renewables Australia, which has around 120.5MWp of operational solar assets and 4.2GW of RE pipeline. We expanded our RE footprint in Europe, namely in the Republic of Ireland, which includes the acquisition of operational solar assets with 276MWp capacity. This underscores our commitment to growing our international RE assets, enabling us to bring back technologies and implement new business models that benefit Malaysia.

At TNB, we strongly believe that there is no transition without transmission. This motivates us in building and maintaining intelligent, resilient and flexible electricity grids that enable the faster adoption of more RE sources.

We have been making steady strides in Develop the Energy Transition Network. In 2023 we expanded and upgraded our transmission and distribution network via a CAPEX investment of RM7.3 billion.

The investment includes building a smart grid and deploying smart meters under the national Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) programme. We installed 873,740 more smart meters, surpassing our target of 600,000 units for 2023. This outstanding achievement brings the total to over 3.5 million smart meters across the Klang Valley, Melaka, Kedah, Johor, and Penang.

To enhance automated network control and fast supply restoration, we continued the rollout of Distribution Automation (DA). Approximately 4,000 substations were successfully installed and commissioned with DA, covering about 2.6 million customers. This brings our total to 28,340 distribution substations, accounting for  $34\%$  of total distribution stations in Peninsular Malaysia. For our transmission network, we enhanced our Advanced Automatic Fault Analysis (AFA) system to improve response and restoration time during outages.

Another aspect of developing the ET network is cross-border interconnections as they help in achieving ASEAN's ET and decarbonisation targets. At TNB, we are constantly exploring opportunities to expand our regional interconnections through Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) with ASEAN neighbours such as Indonesia, Thailand, and Singapore. These agreements are strategic stepping stones towards the development of interconnection projects that are expected to strengthen the ASEAN power grid. A key milestone was achieved with the completion of a joint feasibility study with EGAT Thailand in 2023, paving the way forward for the expansion of the interconnection between Peninsular Malaysia and Thailand.

As a responsible grid owner, TNB carefully tracks and analyses electricity demands in anticipation of new and emerging economic growth in the country. In recent years, we have seen a significant surge in demand from hyperscale co-location data centres in Malaysia. In response to this growing market, we introduced the Green Lane Pathway in 2023 to fast-track the on-boarding process and significantly reduce the time taken for the supply connection of electricity to data centres. As of April 2024, we have managed to complete the power supply connection to 11 data centres totaling 1,156MW.

In anticipation of increasing energy demands in the future, we identified hydrogen and energy storage as promising domains to be explored. Preliminary efforts to explore the adoption of these technologies in Malaysia were made such as advancing the studies for hydrogen business development and completing a feasibility study of potential sites for a large-scale battery energy storage system (BESS) flagship project in Malaysia by our Grid division.

DYNAMIC ENERGY SOLUTIONS

At TNB, our journey to empower customers and deliver exceptional services continues to evolve, reflecting our enduring commitment to create relevant value that are appreciated by our customers, who are slowly embracing a smarter and greener lifestyle.

TNB continues to encourage our customers to be engaged in our collective journey towards a sustainable energy future. We have stayed on course with our initiatives to elevate customer engagement and satisfaction, widened the use of rooftop solar panels nationwide and invested significant resources to boost the electrification of Malaysia's transport sector.

# CEO'S STRATEGIC & OPERATIONAL REVIEW

TNB remains at the forefront of the electrification of the transportation sector, which continues to grow at a rapid pace here in Malaysia and regionally. As of end-2023, the number of Electric Vehicles (EVs) on the road jumped to 10,159 units from 2,631 in 2022, while the total number of Direct Current (DC) fast EV charge points has increased to 503, bringing the total number of charge points to 2,288 as of April 2024. To meet this growing demand, we have significantly expanded the TNB Electron charging network to 32 charge points at strategic locations across Peninsular Malaysia. These include PLUS/LPT2 highways, commercial buildings, and TNB Premises, providing greater convenience for EV owners.

Beyond our borders, we have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Chargeplus (Charge+) to facilitate cross-border EV charge points across Malaysia and Singapore. This MOU forms the foundation to develop a seamless cross-border network of 30,000 charge points by 2030 spanning 5,000km of highways across Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.

Additionally, TNB is focused in engaging our customers to understand the means of managing their energy consumption better. To accomplish this objective, we elevated the Malaysia Energy Literacy Programme (MELP) to a national-level initiative with oversight by the Ministry of Energy Transition and Water Transformation (PETRA). MELP aims to support the national ET agenda by improving the energy literacy of Malaysians. A significant milestone for MELP was reached in 2023 when Universiti Tenaga Nasional and Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) decided to incorporate energy literacy modules into their curriculum. Both tertiary institutions have agreed to enhance energy literacy through programmes, initiatives, publications, and research.

In the rooftop solar PV space, GSPARX continues to play a significant role in transforming TNB's customers into prosumers. By the end of 2023, GSPARX secured a cumulative 340MWp of solar capacity, including a nationwide project involving AEON shopping centres and AEON BiG supermarkets with a total capacity of 78MWp. Meanwhile, TNBX, a wholly-owned subsidiary of TNB, focuses on sustainable energy solutions. It launched several innovations such as SuriaShield residential solar PV insurance and the Virtual Energy Manager solution to assist commercial and industrial customers in managing their electricity usage.

Digitalisation has been a key lever in helping us deliver exceptional customer experience, particularly through the wider adoption and greater functionality of the award-winning myTNB app. myTNB currently has over has 6.7 million subscribers with features aimed at promoting customer empowerment and sustainable practices. The features we have introduced continue to delight our customers and as proof of its user-friendliness and relevance, it was recognised by a leading technology publication, PC.com for being the Best Public Utility App in 2023.

# DRIVE REGULATORY EVOLUTION

![](images/591a1242a5aa05c05da237c4bc77c03f98eb21bf69d714a55e6bfc195a34da86.jpg)

In addressing the future of the electricity industry within Malaysia, TNB is strategically navigating the evolving regulatory and policy landscape to ensure the best outcomes for its business, stakeholders, and the broader community. It is here that we recognise the symbiotic relationship between government support, TNB's proactive measures, and the collective move towards a sustainable energy transition.

In 2023, we continue to see our Malaysian government's steadfast support for the Incentive Based Regulation (IBR) framework, which has been governing our electricity sector since 2014. We recovered about RM16 billion of fuel costs via the Imbalance Cost Pass-Through (ICPT) mechanism, which helped improve our financial liquidity.

As a key enabler of Malaysia's ET journey, TNB has been an active participant at global meetings such as COP28 and organising our own Energy Transition Conference. The government's bullish stance on the ET is evident with the multitude of supportive policy announcements and blueprints launched over the past two years, including the Low Carbon Mobility Blueprint 2021-2030, National Energy Policy 2022-2040, Malaysia Digital Economy Blueprint 2021-2030, New Industrial Master Plan 2030, the Malaysian Energy Transition Outlook and the NETR. This is in addition to the enhancement of existing programmes such as increased quotas for the Corporate

Green Power Programme (CGPP) and the Net Energy Metering (NEM) scheme.

TNB has collaborated with relevant stakeholders to drive the ET journey. For instance, we collaborate with the Zero Emissions Vehicle Association (ZEVA) which actively advocates for the development of related legislation, policies, and standards for electric vehicles (EVs). Furthermore, we continue to be involved in the MyPOWER-led MESI (Malaysian Electricity Supply Industry) study, ensuring that we are contributing to a future-proof MESI, capable of addressing the challenges of decarbonisation while maintaining energy security, equity, and sustainability. The results of the study, which was completed in 2022, provided valuable insights and opportunities for further discussion.

# OUTLOOK

As Malaysia steers into 2024, it is poised to be an exciting year with TNB at the forefront of the nation's ET journey. We are directing greater focus to our domestic businesses and investments in support of key initiatives to help achieve the goals outlined under the NETR.

In line with this, we are preparing to participate in the LSS Programme's fifth cycle (LSS5) which will see an expanded quota of up to 2GW, including a novel category for floating solar projects. Complementing this will be the Low Carbon Energy Generation Programme (LCEGP) with a 400MW quota, which opens up opportunities for other low-carbon power generation, such as small hydro, biogas, biomass, and hydrogen.

In terms of addressing the intermittency issues of RE sources, we are planning to initiate Malaysia's first utility-scale Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) project with 400MWh capacity. This pilot project, spearheaded by TNB and overseen by the Energy Commission, represents a pioneering step in enhancing grid stability and reliability, marking a significant milestone in Malaysia's journey towards a sustainable energy future. Regionally, we look forward to our collaboration with Laos' utility service provider, Electricite du Lao (EDL), which opens new possibilities for cross-border electricity trade within ASEAN.

On the regulatory front, as we move closer to the Regulatory Period 4 (RP4) 2025-2027, TNB's overarching goal is to continue supporting our customers' energy needs and facilitating Malaysia's Energy Transition. In this context, TNB is stepping up once again with significant CAPEX to maintain security of supply, meet the projected electricity demand growth of  $1.6 - 4.3\%$  and facilitate the Energy Transition. We aim to allocate a larger proportion of the CAPEX (compared to the previous year) for ET-related spending. Regarding the tariff structure, TNB is supportive of tariff reforms that ensure electricity costs are appropriately reflected on a fair and equitable basis, delivering positive results for the industry over the long term.

While 2023 was the year when ET really got started in Malaysia, 2024 and beyond are when we execute in earnest the exciting programmes within NETR. Indeed, TNB is perfectly primed to benefit from all the opportunities offered by NETR for we are fully committed to ensuring Malaysia achieves its ambitions. With TNB leading the charge, we are confident that we can facilitate the nation to achieving its energy transition goals, fostering a sustainable, resilient, and prosperous future for all.

# OVERVIEW

In 2023, TNB produced a total of 95,203GWh of electricity, of which 79,355GWh was generated from coal and gas sources and 7,903GWh from renewable energy sources. Total renewable energy (RE) made up  $8.3\%$  of the total electricity sent out in 2023, a slight decrease from the  $8.7\%$  in 2022.

In alignment with our Reimagining TNB strategy and Energy Transition plan, we have continued to uphold the operational excellence of our conventional and RE generation fleet, explored new collaborations to decarbonise our thermal plants in Malaysia and forged ahead with acquiring and developing new RE assets.

# DOMESTIC GENERATION BUSINESS UPDATE

# Operational Performance Update

In 2023, TNB Power Generation Sdn. Bhd. power plant availability factor in Peninsular Malaysia was  $83.3\%$ , a slight improvement from the  $83.2\%$  recorded in 2022. The improvement was mainly contributed by the continual optimisation of the planned outages at our thermal plants.

The plant availability factor was significantly affected after one of our major power plants, the TNB Janamanjung 1GW coal-fired plant, experienced an unexpected outage in December 2023. Remedial actions are already underway, and we will be striving to rectify this issue as early as possible to resume plant operation. Prior to this, our plant availability factor had improved by  $1.5\%$  quarter-on-quarter in Q3 2023, due to lower unplanned outages during the period, which contributed to a  $43.6\%$  quarter-on-quarter improvement in capacity payment. Our measures to reduce boiler tube failures and minimise planned outages in 2023 also paid off, leading to an improved plant Equivalent Unplanned Outage Factor (EUOF) of  $6.58\%$  (FY2022:  $7.37\%$ ).

Our pursuit of plant operational excellence has led to TNB Genco winning several awards, including:

# Asian Power Awards 2023

# Decarbonising Our Conventional Thermal Plants

At TNB, we recognise that conventional thermal plants will continue to play an important role in Malaysia in providing a reliable and affordable base load. Nevertheless, our efforts to decarbonise our plants will continue at a steady pace as outlined in our own ET plan and to support the nation's efforts to achieve Net Zero by 2050. In this context, this year, we have established important collaborations with companies such as PETRONAS and Toshiba Energy Systems & Solutions Corporation (Toshiba EES) to explore the implementation of Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS) solutions in our thermal plants.

With PETRONAS, our collaboration will explore the viability of storing captured carbon from TNB sites in PETRONAS oil fields, whereas the partnership with Toshiba EES is aimed at accelerating the application of carbon capture technology in our thermal plants. The agreement with Toshiba EES will also see our engineers receiving specialised training to support the delivery and operation of CCS equipment.

# Growing Our RE Assets

In 2023, we continued our steadfast pursuit of more RE generation capacity in Malaysia and internationally inline with our push for RE to comprise  $40\%$  of our total capacity mix by 2025.

TNB Bukit Selambau Solar Dua, an LSS project under the fourth bidding cycle (LSS4) managed to achieve earlier Commercial Operations Date (COD) in December 2023. This is another milestone for TNB that adds another 75MWp solar generation capacity in Malaysia and demonstrates our strong capability in developing, operating, and maintaining LSS power plants.

We have also successfully secured development rights for 135MWp of solar projects through the Corporate Green Power Programme, under the New Enhanced Dispatch Arrangement framework. This will boost not just our revenue and generation capacity in green energy locally but will further demonstrate our commitment to supporting green energy requirement by local and international partners in Malaysia directly.

In support of the National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR), one of TNB's flagship initiatives is the Centralised (LSS) parks project, which will encompass five sites, each with a potential capacity of around 100MW. This initiative fosters collaboration with state economic development bodies, cooperatives, and small and medium-sized enterprises with aims to galvanise local involvement in RE projects, contributing to the sector's holistic growth across the value chain.

We also kick started our domestic floating solar plant investments by issuing a tender for developers to build a 30MW floating solar plant at the Chenderoh Reservoir on the Perak River. This will be closely followed in the future by similar plants at our Temenggor and Kenyir hydro reservoirs.

TNB's Net Zero goal advances through international RE platforms, enhancing collaboration and technology in sustainable energy.

# INTERNATIONAL GENERATION BUSINESS UPDATE

On the international front, TNB International Sdn. Bhd. (TNBI), our platform for capturing global RE opportunities registered a higher full year performance from its onshore wind portfolio of around 100MWp in the United Kingdom (UK), which was acquired in 2022. In addition, overall power price was also favourable in 2023 in the UK region. However, this was offset by a non-cash impairment of goodwill for our investment in Vantage Solar UK Ltd. and Blyth Offshore Demonstrator Ltd. The impairment is an adjustment to reflect the softer power prices in the future and interest rate hike in the region, with no discount to the power plant performance.

We have initiated the construction of two greenfield solar power plants with a total capacity of 102MWp in UK with COD anticipated in 2024. These projects will contribute steadily to our international RE platform as it will be under a 15-year subsidy scheme. Our European RE business also reached another milestone with its expansion into Ireland through the acquisition of a 276MWp operational solar power plant, in line with our international growth strategy to grow towards 1GW of operational and under-construction assets.

In 2023, we made our maiden footprint into Oceania - Australia. Australia has a robust RE landscape, marked by strong regulatory frameworks and well-established ecosystem. Acquiring Spark Renewables is a strategic step in TNB's growth strategy, offering immediate access to operational assets and a promising pipeline. This accelerates our shift towards greenfield development, reducing costs and optimising resource deployment. This acquisition of  $100\%$  interest in Spark Renewables platform comprises a fully operational solar power plant of 120.5MWp together with sizable early-stages development pipeline in various technology including solar and wind. In addition, Spark Renewables has an existing strong management team with highly experienced individuals in the RE industry with a proven track record in pipeline development.

The international platforms will contribute significantly to TNB's Net Zero aspiration by facilitating knowledge exchange, advancing expertise in renewable technologies, enabling technology uptake, and promoting international collaboration to accelerate the country's sustainable energy transition.

# OUTLOOK

Looking ahead, TNB will reinforce our commitment to sustainability and operational excellence. We are committed to maintaining the operational excellence of our generation fleet, with an emphasis on identifying and implementing strategies to reduce operating costs further. A significant focus remains on the accelerated retirement of coal plants, transitioning towards cleaner and more sustainable energy sources in line with our efforts to reduce carbon emissions. In addition, we are making steady progress on the 300MW Nenggiri hydroelectric power project, anticipated to commence commercial operations by 2027, which aligns with our goal to enhance our RE capacity significantly.

Aligning with NETR and the government's aspiration for increased domestic investments, we will be recalibrating our strategy to prioritise investments in Malaysia. This involves acquiring operational and/or late-stage RE assets to bolster TNB's expertise in the RE sector and spearhead the energy transition. We are also set to expedite the development of early-stage projects, transforming them into operational assets within the stipulated budget and timeline.

On the international front, TNB is committed to grow its presence through both our international RE platforms and will continue to provide support, especially in Australia, where the current focus is on converting development pipelines into operational assets, which may involve tender participation. This strategy will leverage TNB's extensive experience in developing power projects in both international and domestic markets, along with knowledge and technology transfer within the TNB Group. Our RE capability is further demonstrated by a capable team in the UK handling various RE technologies as well as managing different stages of RE projects i.e., construction, development, operations, and maintenance.

In addition, TNB's international RE platforms are also exploring alternative revenue mechanisms, such as the Contract-for-Difference scheme, corporate Power Purchase Agreements and Battery Energy Storage System based opportunities. These initiatives, introduced through recent acquisitions, promise to diversify income sources while reinforcing the international assets' financial resilience thus strengthening TNB's transition towards renewable energy and contributing to our National Net Zero commitments.

At the core of these efforts is TNB's commitment to balancing the energy trilemma - affordability and access, energy security, and environmental sustainability - aligning with the nation-building agenda through education, vendor programmes, employment opportunities, and training.

![](images/2a31a698d766a2bbff2910692de1155fcbcf11f3817528c415773a19b41515b1.jpg)

TNB's active engagement in shaping energy policies and its support for the government's agenda were also manifested through alignment with the  $12^{\text{th}}$  Malaysia Plan 2021-2025, Key Ministries Strategic Planning 2025, and the visions and missions of State Governments. These efforts underscored TNB's dedication to facilitating a smooth transition towards a more sustainable and renewable energy (RE) landscape, reinforcing its position as a key player in Malaysia's journey towards achieving a  $70\%$  RE target by 2050.

We also recognise the evolving challenges within the regulatory landscape such as the formation of a new energy ministry in December 2023. These structural adjustments have tangible implications for the governance of the energy sector. In response, our Strategic Engagement Roadmap for 2023 identified 21 Key Focus Areas, with a priority on engagements related to the Regulatory Period 4 proposal and the communication plan for the Imbalance Cost Pass-Through (ICPT) mechanism.

We will continue to be guided by our consistent, professional and collaborative approach with regulatory stakeholders, noting that our Regulatory Relationship Strength Index (RRSI) score has improved further. In 2023, TNB achieved its highest RRSI score yet, with an impressive Trust Index of  $92\%$ . This score reflects a strong rapport and trust between TNB and the regulators, showcasing a notable increase from previous years and indicating a consistent upward trajectory in stakeholder relations. The RRSI serves as a crucial metric, evaluating the level of stakeholders' trust in TNB and highlighting the company's ability to understand and meet the needs of key stakeholders for future improvement plans.

# Strengthening the Electric Supply Industry (ESI)

In 2023, TNB continues to contribute towards reinforcing the structure and sustainability of the ESI in Malaysia. A key initiative in this endeavour was TNB's active participation in the "Future-proofing MESI Study," spearheaded by MyPower. This study was aimed at identifying optimal pathways for the evolution of the Malaysian Electricity Supply Industry (MESI), with a focus on achieving a balance between energy security, energy equity, environmental sustainability, economic development, and enhancing customer experience. The primary objective was to ensure that MESI could adapt to future challenges, especially those arising from the urgent need to decarbonise in a landscape characterised by diverse and shifting demands.

The study provided a comprehensive long-term roadmap and implementation plan, laying the groundwork for MESI to face forthcoming challenges with resilience, despite the pressures of faster decarbonisation. In 2023, MyPower Corp.'s focus was on disseminating the outcomes of the study among key stakeholders, including TNB, to coordinate and ensure a smooth rollout of the initiatives identified. This study underscored the importance of transitioning towards a sustainable energy future, in line with Malaysia's economic development goals.

An integral part of strengthening MESI would be the establishment of an energy exchange, overseen by an independent Single Buyer. This proposed initiative would be pivotal in streamlining the mechanisms for managing the planning and procurement of electricity in Peninsular Malaysia as it would enhance industry transparency and clarity while setting a fair and competitive price for energy based on supply and demand. This, in turn, benefits both generators and consumers. TNB has expressed its full support for the newly planned energy exchange, emphasising its commitment to facilitating a comprehensive framework that ensures seamless connection and trading of RE between generators and consumers.

Another critical government-led effort that has ensured the sustainability of MESI has been the implementation of the ICPT mechanism. The ICPT is a crucial tool that allows TNB to adjust electricity tariffs in response to fluctuations in fuel and generation costs. In 2023, the government again demonstrated its unwavering commitment to the ICPT, approving subsidies amounting to RM10.4 billion for the period of January to June and an additional RM4.7 billion for July to December and enabling TNB to recover approximately RM15.1 billion in total. The government's strong commitment to the ICPT mechanism has had a direct and positive impact on the stability of TNB and by extension, the nation's electricity supply industry.

# Accelerating a Responsible Energy Transition

In 2023, TNB contributed to Malaysia's concerted efforts to accelerate a responsible ET, through various initiatives and programmes aimed at enhancing Malaysia's RE capabilities and fostering a greener energy landscape. A cornerstone of these efforts was the government's launch of the NETR during The Energy Transition Conference 2023 that was organised by TNB on 28-29 August 2023. The NETR outlines strategic projects and initiatives based on key Energy Transition levers: Energy Efficiency, Renewable Energy, Hydrogen, Bioenergy, Green Mobility, and Carbon Capture and Utilisation Storage. TNB has been entrusted as a champion for several NETR flagship projects, underscoring the important role we have to play in driving the country's energy transition efforts.

In support of the energy transition, the government expanded the Corporate Green Power Programme by an additional 200MW, bringing the total quota to 800MW. This expansion, coupled with the extension of the application deadline, signifies a strong push towards increasing corporate participation in renewable energy generation. Similarly, the expansion of the Net Energy Metering (NEM) programme through an additional quota allocation of 1,450MW under NEM 3.0,

reflects a concerted effort to facilitate the adoption of solar energy and enhance energy sustainability within the business sector.

TNB's active participation in the ET journey was further showcased at the Conference of the Electricity Power Supply Industry (CEPSI) 2023 and the  $28^{\text{th}}$  Conference of the Parties (COP28) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. CEPSI provided a global platform for TNB to affirm its commitment to leading Malaysia's energy transition, presenting transformative renewable energy projects and fostering international collaboration. TNB's leadership at the conference, including technical paper presentations and the receipt of accolades, highlighted its role as a thought leader and key player in navigating the global energy transition towards a low-carbon future.

Meanwhile, TNB's commitment to COP28 is in line with our strategic objectives, aiming to reinforce our role in driving the energy transition within Malaysia and the wider region. TNB is proud to support Malaysia's climate change agenda, working closely with the government and various ecosystem players across the energy transition value chain at COP28. This dedicated effort underscores TNB's commitment to spearhead sustainable energy solutions for a better, brighter future.

# OUTLOOK

Looking ahead, the upcoming RP4 is poised to be a critical phase for TNB, marking a significant shift in Malaysia's energy sector regulation and policy framework. The groundwork for the RP4 regulatory submission has been carefully prepared, reflecting TNB's proactive approach to align with evolving energy needs and sustainability goals. The proposal development process has been comprehensive, incorporating feedback from stakeholder engagement and adhering to internal business planning processes.

Two overarching strategic objectives form the core of the RP4 proposal: Delivering for our customers and Facilitating the Energy Transition. These objectives emphasise TNB's commitment to ensuring a stable and secure electricity supply while also supporting Malaysia's ambitious goals for a sustainable energy future. TNB's dedication to these objectives is evident in its efforts to foster the integration of renewable generation, expand consumer choices, and address the challenges across the electricity supply value chain.

Moreover, the RP4 proposal is crafted to harmonise six key objectives, ensuring a holistic approach that delivers comprehensive benefits to the nation. These objectives are:

# Improve Sustainability:

Accelerating Malaysia's ET by strengthening the grid and providing access to green electricity.

# Maintain Security of Supply:

Ensuring a reliable supply of electricity to support the growth of new industries and demand.

# Balance Affordability:

Implementing tariff redesigns to ensure a fair distribution of costs while protecting vulnerable segments of the population.

# Enhance Customer Empowerment:

Enabling customers to participate in the green economy through expanded offerings and digital experiences.

# Spur Socio-economic Development:

Driving significant Gross Domestic Product impact, job creation, and social impact projects through TNB's investments.

As TNB embarks on this crucial journey, 2024 is designated as the negotiation period for RP4. During this time, TNB will engage in close collaboration with Suruhanjaya Tenaga and relevant ministries to refine and finalise the proposal. This collaborative effort underscores TNB's role in steering Malaysia towards its net zero ambitions and ensuring that the energy sector remains resilient, sustainable, and aligned with national and global energy goals.

# THE MARKET LANDSCAPE

With the COVID-19 pandemic firmly in the past and economic recovery driving the country forward, customers' electricity demand in Peninsular Malaysia grew by  $3.6\%$  in 2023. The supply side saw coal contributing to  $57.0\%$  of the generation mix, followed by gas at  $36.7\%$ , hydro at  $4.6\%$ , solar at  $1.5\%$  and distillates at  $0.2\%$ .

In 2023, the global energy landscape, particularly in the coal sector, experienced significant dynamics shaped by fluctuating demand, geopolitical tensions, and the gradual shift towards cleaner energy sources. Despite challenges, global coal demand remained robust, with consumption hitting new all-time highs, driven by various factors including the economic recovery post-pandemic and the energy needs of emerging economies.

Coal prices, after soaring to unprecedented levels in 2022 due to a tight global supply and increased demand, particularly from Europe's shift back to coal amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict and supply chain disruptions, began to stabilise in 2023. This stabilisation was influenced by factors such as mild weather conditions in Europe, ample stockpiles at coal-fired power plants, and a gradual convergence of coal prices across different regions.

# NAVIGATING THE FUEL PRICE HEADWINDS

In FY2023, the average market coal price moderated to USD 134/MT reflecting a significant decrease from the all-time high above USD 415/MT in May 2022, yet still substantially higher than the base coal price of USD 79/MT set for Regulatory Period 3 (RP3).

While coal prices were not as high as 2022, it still posed a challenge to the system's financial stability as generation costs make up  $65\%$  of the electricity costs in the tariff. TNB's cash flow continued to be pressured due to the high payment obligations to ensure security of supply to customers.

Nevertheless, the industry was able to navigate these headwinds with the implementation of the Imbalance Cost Pass-Through (ICPT) mechanism that reflected the government's response to fluctuating global fuel prices and its commitment to energy sustainability. The ICPT mechanism, under the Incentive Based Regulation (IBR) framework, reflects changes in fuel and generation-related costs in the electricity tariff, aiming to manage these fluctuations effectively.

With the price of coal tracking downwards as the year progressed, adjustments were made to the ICPT mechanism to minimise the ICPT surcharge's impact on consumers while encouraging energy efficiency and the adoption of renewable energy (RE) sources to control electricity costs.

# 2023 Adjustments

In 2023, the government allocated a total electricity subsidy of approximately RM16 billion to mitigate the impact of fuel price volatility on electricity tariffs. This subsidy aimed to ensure that most consumers, especially domestic and non-domestic low-voltage users, would not be adversely affected by tariff adjustments, despite the high average price of coal exceeding the RP3 projected fuel cost.

For the period 1 January 2023 until 30 June 2023, the tariff rate was maintained for domestic, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), and all Agricultural customers. There was also a surcharge of 20 sen/kWh applied to other Non-Domestic customers.

For the period 1 July 2023 until 31 December 2023, the government rolled out a targeted subsidy scheme where MSMEs, specific agricultural sectors, and a new category of water and sanitation operators enjoyed maintained or reduced surcharges. For domestic consumers, the ICPT rebate was applied to those with a monthly consumption of up to 1,500kWh, with a surcharge for high-consumption users exceeding this threshold.

![](images/8c223db56f6e896c291c1e1c4c5cff60ebdd5caece130a898145b265cc6c3a77.jpg)

# 2024 Adjustments

In December 2023, further adjustments were announced for the period of January 1 until June 30, 2024. This included maintaining a 2 sen/kWh rebate for domestic users with a monthly electricity consumption of up to 600kWh, a change from the previous threshold of 1,500kWh. No surcharge was applied for consumption between 601kWh and 1,500kWh, while the surcharge for consumption above 1,500kWh remained at 10 sen/kWh. These adjustments ensured that  $85\%$  of domestic consumers would not be affected, focusing government subsidies more precisely. Non-domestic users, including commercial and industrial low-voltage tariff categories, water and sanitation operators, and specific agricultural tariffs, did not see an increase in their electricity tariffs, with the ICPT surcharge maintained at 3.7 sen/kWh for them. Other non-domestic consumers continued to face a surcharge of 17 sen/kWh.

# DRIVING A RESPONSIBLE ENERGY TRANSITION

Malaysia has taken a significant step forward in its energy transition (ET) journey in 2023 as the government clearly articulated the pathway to achieving Net Zero Emissions by 2050. Through important policy and roadmap announcements, such as the National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR) and the Malaysia Energy Transition Outlook, the country now has a detailed roadmap for the transition that will also create economic growth, job opportunities and income generation in green industries.

The NETR includes flagship catalyst projects like Hybrid Hydro-Floating Solar Photovoltaic, Large-Scale Solar Parks, and Co-firing of Hydrogen-Ammonia. These projects are part of Malaysia's broader aspirations to achieve net zero carbon emissions and a  $70\%$  installation of RE capacity by 2050. In addition, the upcoming introduction of an RE exchange in 2024 signifies a major step towards economic opportunities for domestic RE industry players and aligns with the nation's sustainable development goals.

At the heart of Malaysia's ET is the shift from fossil fuel-based systems to RE sources, such as solar power, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance ESG factors. This transition, termed as "Just Energy Transition", adds a social dimension by ensuring that the transformation is equitable and inclusive, stressing on community involvement, job creation, universal energy access, and socio-economic considerations.

TNB's role in this transition is pivotal, focusing on decarbonising power generation through investment in green technologies, strengthening the grid and empowering electrification across sectors. By fostering collaboration with government and stakeholders, TNB is at the forefront of ensuring a reliable, resilient and flexible grid to support Malaysia's energy needs.

# SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE

# SPEARHEADING OUR SUSTAINABILITY AGENDA THROUGH STRENGTHENED GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE

A strong sustainability governance and leadership structure is vital to spearhead our sustainability agenda and provide us with clear and definitive guidance to achieve our net zero aspirations. Our sustainability governance forms a part of the TNB Governance Framework that is aligned with the principles of the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance (MCCG). The TNB Sustainability Governance Structure is in place to facilitate oversight, strategic management, and implementation of sustainability strategies and initiatives at all levels.

![](images/082fd148e1616dc6d556283ac84648c3b418b3b475805b2386a6d3e97dee7db8.jpg)  
TNB Sustainability Governance Structure

A key development to strengthen the TNB Sustainability Governance Structure is the formation of the BSRC, which has taken effect on 25 August 2023. Our BOD continues to demonstrate its commitment towards our sustainability agenda by expanding the oversight scope of the TNB Board Risk Committee to include sustainability; with that, the Board Risk Committee was renamed BSRC with enhanced terms of reference. The BSRC remains dedicated to overseeing the effective implementation of sustainability initiatives with robust risk management to address exposures and harness opportunities and to ensure strategic integration of sustainability into operations and decision-making.

To further enhance the deployment of our sustainability strategies, the BOD approved the formation of the Sustainability Division, which our first Chief Sustainability Officer has led since June 2023. The primary function of the Sustainability Division is to ensure the effective deployment of our sustainability strategies to meet targets and to strengthen sustainability governance across the Group. The division engages, facilitates, and advises the Business Entities on their day-to-day implementation of sustainability and energy transition initiatives.

Cross reference with the BSRC membership and TOR in the IAR under the Corporate Governance section, Principle A Board Leadership & Effectiveness

The SETC, led by the President/Chief Executive Officer (CEO), continues to play its role in steering the development of sustainability and energy transition strategies and policies, and its implementation as well as providing oversight and input on opportunities and risk exposures. In addition to TNB Top Management, who are SETC members, selected future leaders are also active members to ensure the long-term continuity of our sustainability and energy transition agenda.

The key functions of the SETC are:

- Define sustainability targets and commitments that align with and support the overarching TNB business strategy.  
Shape energy transition outcomes that foster growth, create value, and proactively address sustainability challenges, including climate-related risks.  
Deliberate prioritised initiatives based on the TNB Materiality Matrix and Sustainability Deployment Blueprint and endorse the allocation and utilisation of resources.  
- Steer sustainability performance and progress against target.  
Streamline data governance for timely and balanced sustainability disclosure.  
- Oversee stakeholder management and engagement that meets stakeholders' needs and expectations.

# FY2023 ESG KPIs for TNB Top Management

In 2023, sustainability-linked Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were further enhanced and embedded within the Board and senior management's performance evaluation scorecard to drive group-wide accountability in steering our sustainability performance. Sustainability performance objectives relating to the ESG pillars are tied to the President/CEO and Top Management KPIs, as shown below:

# MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT

# TNB MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT

With the above in mind, our sustainability agenda focuses on material ESG matters outlined in our materiality matrix. We have a comprehensive materiality assessment every two (2) years; the last was in FY2022. This assessment allows us to stay ahead of emerging trends, changing stakeholder expectations, and other operational challenges. In 2023, we carried out a limited-scale materiality review.

We based the materiality assessment process on the following three (3) phases, as guided by the Bursa Sustainability Reporting Guide ( $3^{\text{rd}}$  Edition):

# Identification

- Considering TNB's business strategy (Reimagining TNB and TNB ET Plan) and strategic Risks.  
Gap assessment input from:

o Stakeholder groups  
o ESG Pathway to ‘A’ and Beyond project team  
o External benchmark

# Prioritisation

- Obtain feedback from identified personnel from business entities, overseeing and directly engaging with external or internal stakeholder groups to prioritise the relative importance of material matters from the perspective of stakeholder groups and their impact on TNB.  
- Review the prioritisation of the material matters in the matrix.

# Validation

- Deliberation and validation by SETC of the reviewed TNB Materiality Matrix.  
- Approval by the TNB BOD of the reviewed TNB Materiality Matrix.

As a result, the eleven (11) material matters for FY2023 are depicted in the materiality matrix below.

TNB MATERIALITY MATTERS 2023

The following is a summary of critical updates to the TNB Materiality Matrix FY2023 as compared to FY2022:

- Matters related to "Customer Experience and Satisfaction", previously disclosed as a sub-topic in "Responsible Business and Financial Performance", are now a separate material matter highlighting increasing customer expectations towards accelerating energy transition and energy efficiency.  
- "Energy Transition and Innovation" and "Climate Change and Emission" remain key priorities for stakeholders and TNB.  
- "Environmental Management" has shifted to a slightly lower priority for TNB. Environmental matters relating to emissions, water, and waste form part of our energy transition, as well as climate change material matters and strategy.  
- "Responsible Business and Financial Performance" has shifted to a higher priority, reflecting our strategy and focus on responsibly balancing the energy trilemma.

- "Community Development and Human Rights" has increased in priority for stakeholders, reflecting their interest in TNB's management of a just energy transition across the value chain, particularly regarding human rights.  
- Prioritisation for "Cybersecurity Management", "Safety, Health and Well-being" and "Employment Culture" have lowered, reflecting stakeholders' confidence of the outcome in our ongoing initiatives.  
- The material matter related to the supply chain has been refined to "Sustainable and Responsible (added) Supply Chain", emphasising the importance of sustainable and responsible practices across the entire supply chain.

Our revised Materiality Matrix renews our focus on material matters, which forms the basis of our Sustainability Statement. The respective indicators facilitate the monitoring and measurement of our sustainability performance.

We work closely with the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) to keep abreast of integrity and anti-corruption developments and requirements. In line with this, we have implemented the mandated Organisational Anti-Corruption Plan (OACP), which serves as the basis for anti-corruption measures or initiatives at the Company level, addressing governance issues and weaknesses to prevent corruption and integrity violations.

We have developed the annual Integrity Training and Communication Plan (TCP) to address areas of improvement identified through the annual Integrity Health Index (IHI) survey and to strengthen integrity culture. The TCP's scope includes all levels of employees, contractors and vendors, including programmes/seminars for the BOD. The TCP's progress is reported to the Board Integrity Committee (BIC) quarterly. Furthermore, the training programmes under the TCP are part of fulfilling the TRUST requirements under Section 17A of the MACC Act 2009.

# Energy Transition and Innovation

Malaysia's energy transition (ET) efforts to achieve Net Zero by 2050 will shift the nation's generation mix from fossil fuel-driven energy to renewable and green energy. Despite the push to increase renewable energy (RE) capacity, natural gas will continue to play a pivotal role in Malaysia's energy landscape as the nation moves towards a low-carbon economy.

![](images/87b12a8dd215d0530ccefdfc09204f9ca086b091ce9f3b7f9cf420780be7b8f4.jpg)

The government and TNB have made a clear commitment that there will be no new build-up of greenfield coal plants. Nevertheless, the role of coal in the short- to medium-term is critical to allow diversification of the energy mix and ensure security of supply. Higher RE integration (especially solar) into the national grid requires timely investment to enable a smart and flexible grid system. On the demand side, electrification and energy efficiency continue to significantly contribute towards the nation's energy transition journey.

In line with the above, the TNB ET Plan comprises three (3) strategic pillars with key enablers in shifting from a fossil-based energy mix to greener energy sources. These initiatives align with our Reimagining TNB (RT) implementation that cuts across the electricity value chain, from transitioning power generation to Deliver Clean Generation and enhancing the Develop Energy Transition Network to enable more green solutions, to Dynamic Energy Solutions by enhancing customer experiences through digitalisation and electrification. TNB actively invests in and develops innovative solutions to expedite our ET plan.

TNB's ET journey is further strengthened with our active participation in the National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR), which aims to reduce the nation's carbon footprint. Three (3) of TNB's ET projects have been adopted under two (2) of the NETR's flagship catalyst initiatives, namely solar park and hybrid hydro floating solar PV under the RE Zone initiative and co-firing of hydrogen and ammonia under the Hydrogen for Power initiative.

The energy transition, marked by a shift from conventional fossil fuel-based energy sources to cleaner and more sustainable alternatives, significantly impacts electrical grids. Distributed energy resources (DERs) such as rooftop solar panels play a pivotal role in creating a more decentralised energy landscape.

Unlike the traditional one-way flow of energy from power plants to consumers through the transmission and distribution grid, this decentralisation introduces a bidirectional flow of electricity. Consumers now increasingly become prosumers, actively participating in both electricity production and consumption. The management of these dynamic energy flows necessitates the implementation of smart grids and Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI).

In 2023, the Grid Division and Distribution Network Division invested over RM2.9 billion and RM5 billion of capital expenditure, respectively, in securing, maintaining and modernising our national grid. The highlights of our smart grid initiatives include the facilitation of RE penetration into the system, expanding AMI and real-time network monitoring and control. Additionally, in 2023, we enhanced our efforts in realising the ASEAN Power Grid aspiration by forming strategic partnerships with ASEAN Member States in the region.

# Facilitation of RE Penetration

The development of Large Scale Solar (LSS) is thriving, with the current operational installed capacity of 473MW in the Distribution network and 1,340MW in the Grid network. TNB's physical grid infrastructure has the capacity to support up to 12,000MW without significant need for upgrades, assuming that the introduction of solar power follows the planned phases and allocations accordingly.

To promote the growth of LSS, our primary focus is on improving grid flexibility while ensuring system stability. To facilitate the integration of DERs by developers and stakeholders, we have collaborated with the Sustainable Energy Development Authority Malaysia (SEDA) to develop a Distributed Generation Hosting Capacity map. This initiative aims to identify available DER connection points and capacities at the medium voltage level (33kV and 11kV).

Through this map, accessible via a Geographic Information System (GIS) platform, both internal and external users can easily access a comprehensive list of substations with hosting capacity. This streamlined process simplifies the connection of RE sources to the grid and supports effective RE planning efforts.

TNB has also undertaken a pilot project to develop battery energy storage to reinforce grid resilience for RE integration via interconnection, called Projek Rintis Sistem Penstoran Bateri.

# Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI)

The AMI plays a foundational role in managing a complex energy value chain and facilitates energy transition and customer empowerment through network visibility. Since the AMI project deployment, 3,549,489 smart meters have been installed, mainly in the Klang Valley, Melaka, Kedah and Penang. In 2023, an additional 873,740 smart meters were installed, exceeding our target of 600,000 units. TNB is mandated to roll out AMI and smart meters to more than 9 million Ordinary Power Customers (OPC) in Peninsular Malaysia through year 2027 and beyond.

Customers with smart meters can gain insights into their energy consumption through half-hourly energy usage analysis. The granular information provided by smart meters benefits our customers and empowers our operations to pinpoint grid issues and understand consumer behaviours for more effective service delivery. By providing access to this information through the myTNB mobile app and myTNB Portal, customers acquire the ability to optimise their energy consumption, leading to reduced costs and minimised environmental impacts.

# Network Monitoring and Control

Key efforts to enhance real-time network monitoring and control include Distribution Automation and voltage and reactive power management.

# Distribution Automation (DA)

The DA Project facilitates automated network control and expedites rapid supply restoration. The project's objective is to progressively install DA systems in  $41 \%$ of Peninsular Malaysia's total substations by the end of 2024,  $64 \%$ by the end of 2027, and  $84 \%$ by the end of 2030. In 2023 alone, the DA Project successfully installed and commissioned 4,002 substations that serve approximately 2.6 million customers. This brings our total DA installations since 2014 to approximately 28,340 distribution substations, covering  $34 \%$ of Peninsular Malaysia's total distribution stations. Notably, we have observed an average  $20 \%$ reduction in restoration time for unplanned outages, with outages typically restored within 15 minutes on average.

# SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURES ON MATERIAL MATTERS

# Voltage and Reactive Power Management

Under the ongoing initiative to enhance voltage and reactive power management of the distribution network, we successfully installed and commissioned a total of 120MVAr under the Volt-VAR Optimisation Project in 2023, resulting in a loss reduction of 480,000kWh.

# Enhancing the Interconnected ASEAN Power Grid

Cross-border interconnections play a vital role in advancing ASEAN's ET and achieving decarbonisation goals. The establishment of the ASEAN Power Grid is poised to bolster regional grid stability and security while enabling resource-sharing and facilitating RE expansion across Member States. In 2023, Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) and TNB established an in-house Joint Working Committee (JWC) to undertake a feasibility study on enhancing the interconnection capacity between Peninsular Malaysia and Thailand. This study, completed in August 2023, explored potential technologies and designs, evaluated power system dynamics, analysed interconnection operations and maintenance, and conducted cost-benefit assessments. The aim was to harness mutual resources and develop the necessary regional infrastructure to promote RE adoption.

Several Memorandums of Understanding (MOU) have been signed with ASEAN nations, namely Indonesia, Thailand and Singapore, to foster collaboration in interconnection projects. Ongoing feasibility studies are being conducted to establish new cross-border electricity interconnections, linking Peninsular Malaysia with Sumatra in Indonesia, as well as developing a second interconnection link to Singapore.

# Energy Storage

Among the ten (10) flagship catalyst projects in the NETR is the implementation of Projek Rintis Sistem Penstoran Bateri, a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) to support the  $70\%$  RE capacity target by 2050. In 2023, the Grid Division conducted a feasibility study of potential sites for a large-scale BESS flagship project. This pilot BESS, with an energy capacity of 400MWh, will be implemented by TNB, operated by the Grid System Operator and regulated by the Energy Commission. It is expected to commence in 2025.

# Energy Usage

Consumers play a key role in a successful energy transition. In 2023, we took significant strides in contributing towards a low-mobility ecosystem, enabling RE adoption by customers and empowering customers through digitalised lifestyles. We further embarked on two (2) differentiated solutions for data centre customers in the form of the Greenlane Pathway for a One-Stop Centre and broadband solutions for targeted groups.

# Electrification of Mobility

In spurring the development of a low-mobility ecosystem, TNB has committed RM90 million to accelerate the electric vehicle (EV) adoption rate in Malaysia over a duration of three (3) years (2022-2024). In 2023, we deployed EV charging stations along Peninsular Malaysia's highways and trunk roads to facilitate long-distance customer travel throughout Peninsular Malaysia.

We participate as a charging point operator (CPO) through TNBX Sdn. Bhd. (TNBX), equipment and charging manufacturer through Tenaga Switchgear Sdn. Bhd. (TSG) and EV training hub through TNB Integrated Learning Solution (ILSAS).

In 2023, we electrified 108 vehicles as part of our effort to replace  $30\%$  of our fleet with EVs by 2030. A majority of these vehicles are Operational Electric Vehicles comprising pickup trucks, vans and passenger vehicles, as part of our initiative to analyse the advantages and limitations of using EVs in TNB Operations.

# Enabling RE Adoption by Customers

# Rooftop Solar Prosumers

We continue to grow our self-generation solar solutions under the Net Energy Metering (NEM) and Supply Agreement for Renewable Energy (SARE) schemes through TNB's wholly-owned subsidiary, GSPARX. To date, GSPARX has registered a total of 951 domestic/residential customers, bringing the total capacity to 8.25MW. Meanwhile, for the commercial, industrial and government segments, GSPARX registers a total capacity of 116.61MWp from 204 customers, a substantial increase from 81MWp in 2020.

# Green Electricity Tariff (GET)

With the implementation of the GET since 2022, customers can purchase a low-carbon electricity supply without having to install their own solar rooftop or other RE installations. The RE resources for the GET Programme are generated by solar power plants under the LSS Programme, hydropower stations and any other qualified RE plants approved by the Energy Commission. Customers enrolled in the GET Programme receive the Malaysia Renewable Energy Certificate (mREC) at the end of each calendar year. TNB continues to provide platforms to facilitate customer enrolment. In 2023, a total of 4.452 million GET blocks were subscribed by 2,753 customers.

# Customer Empowerment through Digitalised Lifestyles

Our customers play a critical role in supporting the energy transition by making smart choices and participating in various RE and Energy Efficiency (EE) programmes. With more than 3.5 million successful installations of smart meters by 2023 and 6.4 million myTNB app adoptions, customers are able to experience the benefits of near real-time energy consumption monitoring and budget management. Through myTNB, customers who transitioned from electronic meters to smart meters can actively monitor their electricity usage and energy consumption in real-time - a crucial step towards energy efficiency management.

# Climate Change and Emissions

We support Malaysia's commitment to the Paris Agreement and seek to mitigate our GHG emissions and environmental impacts, as well as adapting to climate-related risks which that includes raising global temperatures, increasing of seawater levels, floods and heat waves and soil movement. We acknowledge the impacts we have on climate change, as well as the threats of climate change to our existing infrastructure and business sustainability.

![](images/bc73d1afbf4bab5e6ee4f56c1c815feedce6f8f6cbb9f86636373dfb5b56d35b.jpg)

At the core of TNB's Energy Transition Plan lies the ambition to achieve Net Zero Emissions and coal-free plant operations by 2050. The transition to Net Zero Emissions began with an interim target of a  $35\%$  reduction in emissions intensity by 2035 before achieving Net Zero Emissions by 2050. The delivery of these targets is anchored on our business operations, national policies and international frameworks on climate change that are aligned with supporting Malaysia's ambitious goals of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.

# Climate Change

We continue to assess and mitigate physical and transition risks, guided by the Representative Concentrating Pathways (RCP) scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and scenarios proposed by the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS).

We also identify business opportunities associated with transitioning to a low-carbon economy and implement adaptation plans for floods, heatwaves, soil movement and coastal inundation.

The TNB ET Plan outlines our long-term strategy to address climate change and emissions, as below:

![](images/507b12179d357d5a8e9255e74e0649ba3da1baebd1fa072fc41f23d570490370.jpg)

We aim to reduce emissions, strategising for:

Cleaner generation capacity

Increased RE capacity

Enhanced operational efficiency across the value chain

We have identified Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS) technology as a potential solution in decarbonising the power sector. We continue to play an active role in researching and advancing this technology

For the remaining hard-to-abate emissions, we are exploring the development of carbon credits with nature-based carbon trading

The transition to decarbonisation focuses on the progressive expansion of low-carbon generation assets and the phasing down of our coal-fired generation capacity in stages. This is further supported by our approach to efficiently operating thermal power plant operations and investing in innovative solutions research and development to scale up efficient energy generation and carbon capture technologies.

# Reducing Carbon Emissions

# Cleaner Generation Capacity

# Reducing Coal Generation Capacity

In 2021, TNB committed to no longer investing in greenfield coal plants. We are exploring the viability of retiring coal-fired power plants earlier than planned, subject to shareholders' agreement and approvals from the relevant authorities and regulators. The GHG Scope 1 emissions of our coal power plants is expected to reduce as these plants retire according to the respective Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), as follows:

![](images/0683c5406f09cb377838be02303125da45688a34bca1c77c1be7da69bc5fc812.jpg)

Our strategy to repower our coal power plants with cleaner technologies is focused on Kapar Energy Ventures (KEV), TNB Janamanjung (TNBJ) and Jimah East Power (JEP). This repowering exercise, which utilises existing sites and infrastructure to generate electricity utilising cleaner technologies such as hydrogen-ready gas power plants and gas power plants equipped with CCS technologies, is expected to reduce our GHG Scope 1 emissions.

# Ammonia-Biomass Co-firing at Coal Power Plants

Our partnerships with Mitsui & Co. and Chugoku are making substantial strides in advancing the feasibility study for co-firing coal with biomass and ammonia at the Jimah East Power Plant. Following the successful completion of the feasibility study at Phase 1, we started Phase 2, with an in-depth analysis of technical behaviours through a small-scale project of actual co-firing with varying concentrations of ammonia and biomass. This phase involved conducting a Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) study for this small-scale co-firing project.

A significant milestone was achieved with the successful execution of the EFB-Pellet Trial Burn for Unit 2 (1,000MW) in September 2023. Notably, this marked the first Biomass Mix-Firing test for a Supercritical type of boiler in Malaysia. The trial run demonstrated positive outcomes, showcasing observable reductions in emissions. Moving forward, further studies and actual tests will be conducted to assess the technical behaviour under increased concentrations, e.g.  $3\%$  to  $5\%$  of biomass and ammonia. This ongoing exploration is integral to refining and optimising our co-firing strategies for enhanced sustainability.

# Hydrogen Fuel: Shifting Away from Fossil-Based Energy

We continue to accelerate the transition from a fossil-fuel-based energy mix to low-carbon energy sources such as hydrogen. Through strategic collaboration with IHI Corporation, we are working together to reduce carbon emissions in identified TNB coal-fired power plants. Our goal is to explore the practicality of using hydrogen in co-firing and conducting tests with different hydrogen concentrations to achieve targeted emissions reductions. This collaboration focuses on both technical and commercial aspects, paving the way for a more sustainable energy future.

# Partnership with PETRONAS

TNB has signed an MOU with PETRONAS, aiming to expedite the decarbonisation process in the energy sector. Building upon the initial TNB-PETRONAS MOU signed on 19 August 2022, the parties are advancing towards a Definitive Agreement for a Joint Feasibility Study focused on green hydrogen as a clean energy alternative. The collaborative study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of commercial viability, considering factors such as the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE), levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH), levelised cost of storage (LCOS), and the sales price of hydrogen  $(\mathsf{H}_2)$ .

# SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURES ON MATERIAL MATTERS

# Increasing Renewable Energy (RE) Capacity

In 2023, TNB's RE capacity reached 4,375MW, a growth of  $16\%$  compared to FY2022 (3,780MW). The announcement of 10 flagship projects under the National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR) in August 2023 has strengthened TNB's RE position in the market.

# Corporate Green Power Programme (CGPP)

In 2023, TNB successfully secured 90MW (135MWp) in solar generation through the government-launched CGPP. This capacity includes both wholly owned 30MW/45MWp and joint venture (2 x 30MW / 2 x 45MWp) facilities. Upon commissioning, the annual emissions avoidance is estimated at 70,646 tCO $_2$ e per year.

# National Energy Transition Roadmap

TNB is championing two (2) RE projects and is a partner in one RE project, as follows:

# i. Championing Green Capacity Growth through Hybrid Hydro-Solar Project (HHFS)

The development of around 2,424MW HHFS in four (4) phases at TNB hydro dam reservoirs will increase TNB's RE capacity.

<table><tr><td>Phase</td><td>Capacity (MW)</td><td>Projected COD</td><td>Estimated Annual Emissions Avoidance (KtCO2e)</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>230</td><td>2025</td><td>319</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>470</td><td>2028</td><td>652</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>800</td><td>2035</td><td>1,110</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>924</td><td>2040</td><td>1,282</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>2,424</td><td></td><td>3,364</td></tr></table>

Phase 1 of the project will be developed by TNB Genco at the Temengor and Chenderoh hydro reservoirs. Feasibility studies will also be conducted for the Terengganu and Kelantan schemes for the remaining project phases. Upon the commissioning of all phases, the annual emissions avoidance is estimated at 3.364 million tCO $_2$ e.

# ii. Championing 5 x 100MW (150MWp) Centralised Solar Parks in Partnership with SMEs

The centralised parks, co-developed by TNB in partnership with SMEs, will consist of a 100MW (150MWp) deployment per site across five (5) sites in several states. For each 100MW park, the emissions avoidance is estimated at  $110\mathrm{KtCO}_{2}$  e per year for 25 years.

# iii. Partnership with Sime Darby for Rooftop Solar

TNB has entered into a partnership with Sime Darby Property for the construction of 4.5MW solar capacity across 450 homes in the City of Elmina, a township in Sungai Buloh, Selangor, and Bandar Bukit Raja, Klang, Selangor. Carbon avoidance is estimated at 7,992 tCO $_2$  e per year.

# Enhance Operational Efficiency Across the Value Chain

# Sustaining Power Plant Efficiency

Thermal power plants can significantly curtail carbon emissions by optimising their fuel consumption, ensuring that less fuel is employed to produce an equivalent amount of electricity. The efficiency of a thermal power plant is typically measured using a parameter called "heat rate" or "thermal efficiency". A lower heat rate indicates a more efficient power plant because it means that less fuel is required to produce each unit of electricity.

We continue to monitor and implement initiatives to improve thermal power plant efficiency, aiming to sustain the efficiency at its designed level. Our efforts have produced a commendable enhancement of the efficiency (heat rate) of thermal power plants in the TNB portfolio, registering an improvement of  $+1.12\%$  from 2022 to 2023. The resulting carbon emissions reduction was  $301\mathrm{KtCO}_2\mathrm{e}$ .

# Managing GHG Emissions from Substations

We aim to lower our sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) fugitive emissions from our substations through recycling at our SF6 Gas Recycling and Reconditioning Centre and reusing the gas in these assets to promote a circular economy.

# Improving Energy Efficiency in Our TNB Office Buildings

In 2023, a campaign called "Drip by Drip, Watt by Watt" was launched by the TNB Global Business Solutions (TGBS) Division with the aim of promoting energy efficiency by reducing electricity and water consumption and involving 109 TNB-owned offices. Since the campaign's start in July 2023, the usage of electricity and water has been captured and monitored monthly.

As at 31 December 2023, our total electricity consumption reduction was 870,063kWh, which translated to a GHG Scope 2 emissions reduction estimated at  $659\mathrm{tCO}_2$  e.

# Energy Efficiency through Greater Customer Empowerment

With the myTNB mobile app, customers with smart meters are further empowered to embrace an energy efficiency lifestyle through interactive energy usage alerts, specifically through the Energy Budget feature. This innovative tool is part of a suite of digital solutions designed to guide customers towards a more sustainable and energy efficiency way of living.

From its inception, the Energy Budget programme has achieved amazing traction, with over 287,625 customers enrolling for its benefits. Together, they have made substantial strides towards a cleaner, greener world, contributing to a collective reduction of 114,953,188kWh. This collective effort is equivalent to erasing 80,711 tCO $_2$ e of carbon emissions. Moreover, the aggregated cost savings resulting from energy efficiency management amounted to a total of RM50,537,412.

# Adopting Carbon Capture Technologies

In 2023, TNB embarked on exploring the feasibility of CCS through a joint study with PETRONAS to capture, transport and store carbon deep underground in geological formations. We continue to work with industry partners, academic institutions and government agencies to accelerate our ET Plan and achieve our milestones towards Net Zero by 2050.

# Nature-Based Solution Through Tree-planting Programme

In 2023, we continued our tree-planting initiative through the My Brighter Green Programme to commemorate TNB's  $74^{\text{th}}$  anniversary. This initiative was undertaken across TNB Group, through which we planted  $6\%$  more of the targeted 74,000 trees at 42 designated areas across Malaysia (equivalent to  $842.28 \, \text{tCO}_2$  e carbon sequestered).

# Exploring Carbon Market Trading

TNB is exploring carbon offsetting for the remaining hard-to-abate emissions with nature-based carbon trading options. This solution is still at the development stage as we strive to implement carbon reduction initiatives first and aggressively invest in promoting RE options and innovative technological solutions before pursuing the carbon trading market option.

# Ensuring Reliable Supply

In 2023, we maintained world-class grid performance with System Minutes (Transmission) of 0.48 minutes and SAIDI (Distribution) of 46.10 minutes. This was achieved with the implementation of the ISO 55001 Asset Management System, a systematic and structured approach to ensure optimum asset performance throughout the life cycle, such as risk-based preventive maintenance leveraging data analytics. Approximately RM6.0 billion was invested in 2023 to strengthen the grid and ensure the reliability of energy supply.

Our Business Continuity Management (BCM) practices enable a prompt and coordinated response to a crisis, as well as the continuity of essential activities. Annual BCM drills across business entities, in collaboration with external stakeholders such as Agensi Bencana Negara Malaysia (NADMA) and Majlis Keselamatan Negara (MKN), are conducted to test our crisis response's effectiveness. For example, in 2023, specific business continuity plans were implemented that ensured continuous and reliable supply of electricity during the state elections and the

Langkawi International Maritime and Aerospace Exhibition (LIMA). Our BCM was also tested during the monsoon season to ensure public safety and protect our assets for safe and prompt restoration of electricity supply.

In balancing the energy trilemma in the country, the Generation Development Plan has been developed based on the guiding principle of optimum fuel mix to ensure optimum power security by providing adequate diversification of fuel and resources. TNB's varied generation fuel mix decreases the risk of dependency on a single fuel source and increases energy supply reliability. We work closely with the Ministry of Energy Transition and Water Transformation (PETRA) and the Energy Commission in developing the Peninsular Malaysia Generation Development Plan. Through the Planning and Implementation Committee for Electricity Supply and Tariff, an optimised generation fuel mix for Peninsular Malaysia is determined for secure, affordable and sustainable electricity supply.

# SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURES ON MATERIAL MATTERS

# Fair and Transparent Tariff Determination

The electricity tariff structure is governed by the Energy Commission based on the IBR framework with built-in incentives to improve our efficiency and for greater tariff transparency to our customers. We are protected against uncontrollable fuel costs with the effective implementation of the Imbalance Cost Pass Through (ICPT) mechanism. The mechanism and cost components in the electricity value chain are described below:

![](images/b219aaf027c4e0dde1dab15db9b8ea812156277d7296c1b7f59dc4ecb243fe65.jpg)

In 2023, we continued to implement the strategies and initiatives in Regulatory Period 3 (RP3), which spans from 2021 to 2024. We are committed to safeguarding this regime through the next RP with additional strategies to accelerate the nation's ET journey.

# Bolstering Regulatory Engagement

We continue to regularly engage with regulatory stakeholders. Testament to our effective engagement are the Regulatory Relationship Strength Index (RRSI) scores that measure stakeholders' trust in TNB.

# SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURES ON MATERIAL MATTERS

# Stop Work Intervention

In 2023, the TNB Stop Work Policy and Intervensi Stop Work (ISW) guidelines were fully implemented. These authorise employees and contractors to perform stop work intervention upon encountering any unsafe conditions or observing unsafe acts at the workplace.

# Occupational Health

We continue to prioritise occupational health (OH) programmes that focus on Noise, Ergonomic and Chemical Management. In 2023, TNB actively participated in the Department of Occupational Safety and Health's Systematic OH Enhancement Level Programme to drive occupational health compliance in our business operations. This programme elevates occupational health among our employees. In 2023, the number of instances of occupational diseases reduced to ten (10) confirmed cases.

# Tenaga Safety Culture

The Tenaga Safety Culture programme aims to inculcate safety as an integral part of everyday working culture, transforming it from a mere compliance activity. The programme is rooted in our four (4) core behaviours: "Assess", "Comply", "Intervene" and "Actively Caring". Various initiatives have been rolled out to foster these core behaviours among all employees. Notably, a holistic approach, including spiritual considerations, has been embraced to align good safety practices with relevant religious teachings.

We continue to implement the Nampak, Dengar & Rasa Selamat (NDRS) programme to reinforce a strong HSE culture among all employees. The NDRS programme encourages employees to be sensitive to their surroundings, evaluate potential health and safety risks, comply with HSE requirements, and take proactive action to prevent risks from materialising. The NDRS framework focuses on three (3) elements - engineering, education and enforcement - and is supported by a consequence management process that rewards positive behaviour, encourages good practices and addresses non-compliance appropriately.

Best HSE practices are recognised annually with awards to business operations and individuals who have instilled a rigorous safety culture. In 2023, 11 business operations and 45 individuals were awarded.

The biennial TNB safety culture assessment was conducted using the "Hearts and Minds safety culture toolkit" methodology of the Energy Institute in the United Kingdom and showcased the progression of our safety culture to "Proactive", from a score of 4.02 in 2021 to 4.16 in 2023.

# Health and Safety Training

We uphold a steadfast dedication to employee development in the area of health and safety practices and culture. In 2023, a total of 154,204 hours of health- and safety-related training for 14,014 employees were completed - a consistent increase from 2021 - to ensure our workforce is equipped with the necessary health and safety skills and knowledge.

# Digitalisation as an Enabler

We leverage digitalisation to manage and centralise HSE data with the progressive rollout of modules for the holistic implementation of our eHSE online system. The TNB Safety Information System captures reports of incidents and near misses, and incidents are investigated to identify corrective and preventive actions to prevent recurrence. The HSE Wallet mobile application enables employees to record potential incidents, stop work intervention occurrences and good safety and health practices across the Group. These digitalised platforms further inculcate our TNB Safety Culture.

![](images/72fb03105c815c098feeb5f48c153556d8deaeaa9f3f9f01bb1660f07e535d15.jpg)

# Total Wellness

We place high importance on employee wellness. The TNB Total Wellness Programme aims to educate and influence employees towards a healthy lifestyle and work-life balance. The "Vibrant Living - Healthier. Together" initiative focuses on six (6) scopes, which are a healthy diet, no smoking/vaping, leading an active lifestyle, weight management, yearly basic health screening and mental well-being. "Wellness Wednesday" health talks and awareness sessions are conducted online weekly, and open to all employees and retirees to increase awareness on common health issues and encourage healthier habits.

Three (3) Klinik TNB, located in TNB Platinum, Bangsar, DuaSentral, Kuala Lumpur and Janamanjung, Perak, have been operationalised to provide safe, effective and reliable medical care to our members (employees, retirees and their respective dependents). 1,276 panel hospitals and clinics are also available nationwide for easy accessibility to essential medical treatment and healthcare. In 2023, a new initiative, namely the Medication Delivery Service, was introduced to provide our members with a safe, reliable and cost-effective supply of long-term chronic medications through the Klinik TNB. In 2023, a total of 18,922 medication packages were delivered throughout Peninsular Malaysia.

# Health and Safety Performance

In 2023, there were zero fatalities related to electrical accidents as compared to 2022 and 2021. However, we regretfully recorded four (4) non-electrical accident fatalities involving three (3) employees and one contractor resulting from motor vehicle accidents and hornet stings. We treat each incident with the utmost attention with thorough investigations and detailed analysis for corrective and preventive interventions at operations, Management and Board levels.

Following a fatality, immediate Stand Downs are implemented across the Group, led by Management, to alert our employees and contractors to prevent an occurrence of a similar nature. Incident Alert bulletins are disseminated to all employees to share immediate precautionary measures, while Iktibar Insiden bullets are issued to share valuable lessons learnt from these unfortunate accidents.

Our LTIFR demonstrated a substantial  $33 \%$ reduction in 2023 (LTIFR = 0.74) compared to 2021 (LTIFR = 1.03), a consistent improvement since 2018. This signified that there was less time lost resulting from work- related injuries.

# Environmental Management

At TNB, our dedication to responsible environmental management resonates through tangible actions and ongoing initiatives, particularly in the areas of emissions, biodiversity, waste management and water management. The Board and Management have set a clear tone regarding environmental management for the preservation and conservation of natural resources, which is reflected in the TNB Environmental Policy. Our core businesses are ISO 14001:2015 compliant in Environmental Management System and we are guided by the TNB Health, Safety and Environmental Management System, which outlines environmental risk identification and control requirements.

![](images/4e5362633c04d6b801a66b81728e86defca2f877b7ba3291dfe6373c26ee5d64.jpg)

In 2023, we enhanced our TNB Environmental Policy from compliance-based towards meeting our sustainability goals. The revised policy addresses gaps identified from environmental best practices with enhancements that focus on the reduction of GHG and toxic emissions arising from business operations, optimising utilisation of natural resources through effective conservation and preservation of water and biodiversity management, and protection of the environmental ecosystem through effective circular economy and proactive prevention of waste and pollution.

![](images/2ce44b073eb978c41df835f2707c1a40a0ec7f3e2389e2d1a00646548b9db780.jpg)

# Management of Toxic Emissions

Beyond carbon dioxide  $(\mathrm{CO}_{2})$ , the combustion of fossil fuels may yield other pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide  $(\mathrm{NO}_{2})$ , sulfur dioxide  $(\mathrm{SO}_{2})$  and particulate matter (PM) that potentially have long-term impacts on both the environment and health. We vigilantly monitor and curtail emissions of  $\mathrm{SO}_{2}$ ,  $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ , CO and PM in accordance with the Environmental Quality (Clean Air) Regulation (CAR) 2014. Annual declaration of toxic emissions is submitted to the Department of Environment and any deviation is reported within 24 hours with rectification measures.

We leverage a range of advanced technologies and practices to optimise fuel mix and maintain the effectiveness of emissions control facilities, such as:

# Water Management

We are prudent in utilising and managing water consumption. In 2023, we continued to leverage digitalisation by introducing the TNB Water Management Inventory online system to track and monitor water consumption at our assets to progressively enhance data collection.

In power generation operations  $80\%$  of water consumption is used for steam generation and power plant cooling systems. All our generating power assets are built and operated in accordance with global World Bank Environmental and Social Standards.

![](images/29d4ff3766314ab88ba19e04302c5ec54b51c92d2869b90e8e0b2bbc3f67fc7d.jpg)

# Closed-loop water usage for steam generation

Water usage in our closed-loop steam generation process is relatively small,  $1.87\%$  to  $3.08\%$ , minimising our reliance on municipal water sources. Power plants continue to operate efficiently using the closed-loop steam generation processes efficiently to reduce water usage percentage through water treatment measures, blowdown minimisation and leak prevention

![](images/da29304f55fb1faf111815a5db00961a00ed703081fd34402e185ede629376bb.jpg)

# Water usage for power plant cooling system

Our cooling process, facilitated through the open circuit Main Cooling Water system, operates efficiently by utilising seawater or river water and subsequently discharging it back into the sea or the river at the regulated operating temperature. This ensures zero net water consumption while adhering to global water conservation standards set forth by the Electric Power Research Institute. Key parameters such as pH, temperature, oil and grease, total suspended solids, and specific contaminants like heavy metals are measured to ensure compliance

The Wastewater Treatment Plant employs sedimentation, filtration and chemical processes to eliminate pollutants. The Environmental Management System (ISO 14001) guides monitoring to ensure compliance with Environmental Quality (Industrial Effluent) Regulations 2009. While most plants adhere to Standard B limits, Sultan Ibrahim Power Plant (SPG) complies with the more stringent Standard A limit.

We continue to implement other water reduction initiatives for power generation processes as follows:

![](images/8659c415b218ed00bb43a7f098f843f03dcc064f2c1648db748fe79112166e52.jpg)

# Rainwater Harvesting

We have embraced rainwater harvesting at TNB buildings for landscape irrigation and gardening which translates into a reduction of municipal water usage. This initiative is implemented at TNB Platinum Towers, Leo Moggie Convention Centre and Balai Islam, Bangsar. In total, the rainwater harvesting system has a holding capacity of 308,500 litres. In our pursuit of sustainable practices, we have implemented the rainwater harvesting system at TNB Sepang Solar and TNB Bukit Selambau Solar, which currently hold capacities of 24,000 litres and 1,000 litres respectively.

# Waste Management

We are committed to effectively managing waste to reduce the adverse effects on human health and the environment. Hazardous and non-hazardous waste are two (2) primary types of waste generated in TNB, each demanding distinct handling and disposal strategies.

# Hazardous Waste

Our hazardous waste handling and disposal process is regulated by the Department of Environment (DOE) and governed by the Environmental Quality Act 1974. Our Scheduled Waste Roadmap 2018-2030 aims to strengthen hazardous waste management with a phased approach involving all employees and key stakeholders.

We continue to record, track and report scheduled waste generated by TNB operations in the Electronic Scheduled Waste Information System. In 2023, scheduled waste was further categorised as "diverted from disposal" and "directed to disposal". This categorisation helps us to understand our waste usage patterns to enable informed waste reduction strategies. The Electronic Waste Inventory System was introduced in 2023 as a tool to record, track and report electronic waste generated from TNB offices for a more holistic monitoring of e-waste management.

# Non-Hazardous Waste

Our management of non-hazardous waste is regulated by the Jabatan Pengurusan Sisa Pepejal Negara and governed by the Solid Waste and Public Cleansing Management Act 2007 (Act 672). We are taking a phased approach towards improving our non-hazardous waste management.

In 2023, the Tenaga Solid Waste Inventory (TESWI) was established to kick-start our non-hazardous waste data collection. TESWI enables business operations to collect data and monitor solid waste generation to promote waste separation and encourage recycling practices.

# Biodiversity Management

We implement preventive and rehabilitative measures to reduce our impact on local biodiversity, including minimising our operations in areas of high biodiversity value. We carry out Environmental Impact Assessments in compliance with the DOE requirements prior to project implementation and follow through with initiatives to ensure biodiversity protection.

Our biodiversity assessments are guided by the International Union for Conservation of Nature guidelines, aiming to protect the surrounding ecosystems of where we operate. Following are examples of biodiversity management projects undertaken:

* FY2023 data was revised using a new methodology aligning with GRI 303-5 using the following formula:  
Water consumption = Total water withdrawal - Total water discharge  
i. For water consumption indicators, seawater used in power plant cooling systems is excluded, as it is returned in full to the nature receptors without substantial changes in quality apart from a slight increase in temperature, subject to authorisation and continuous controls to guarantee the absence of measurable impacts on exposed ecosystems.  
ii. Total water withdrawal is the sum of the various water resources obtained by direct measurement (flowmeters) or by estimating the output of the water withdrawal pumps. In TNB, most of the water withdrawn is used in cooling processes, especially in power generation.

# Vendor Performance Evaluation

We continued implementing the Contractor Assessment and Supplier Evaluation (CASE) as a dynamic and transparent tool for vendor performance monitoring and evaluation. Vendors with ratings below three will be notified and engaged in performance improvement. CASE results are key input for assessing vendor selection.

![](images/a287098cddf7abfbf4616c77df42e06c194881d0412617d29f55e801fec9cc1f.jpg)

# Vendor ESG Programme

In 2023, we embarked on a survey to assess the ESG readiness of our active vendors. Approximately  $20\%$  had responded by the end of 2023. We are developing a comprehensive ESG programme to ensure that our vendors are in harmony with our ESG aspiration. This initiative underscores our dedication to responsible and sustainable business practices.

# Digitalisation for Sustainable Supply Chain

We leverage digitalisation to propel us towards a more efficient and streamlined approach, reducing reliance on manual systems and saving valuable time in our procurement operations.

# e-Commerce Marketplace

We continue to embrace e-commerce platforms such as Lapasar, MyB2b and RS Puma to improve our sourcing productivity. We have streamlined our digital processes to optimise inventory management and enhance operational efficiency through real-time tracking. As a result, we have better control over inventory levels and minimise shortages or excesses.

Since the inception of these e-commerce initiatives, TNB has experienced consistent growth in e-commerce platform transaction volumes. This trend underscores the effectiveness and acceptance of e-commerce platforms within our procurement framework.

# Procurement Connected Planning (PCP)

We continue to enhance our procurement planning through PCP. This cloud-based platform allows collaboration between TNB and vendors to plan and manage our supply chain using advanced data analytics. With automated data integration, PCP enables real-time analysis, planning, and dashboards such as Demand Planning, Inventory Management, Supplier Delivery Performance, Contract Monitoring, Vendor Risk Analysis and Spend Analysis to enable informed decision-making.

![](images/4eab753afb6f0dcd30f1b7e2c47d38c47445d2dccab7504fa8eb10c17b16ed85.jpg)

# Procurement Cycle Digitalisation (PCD)

The PCD integrates work processes. It accelerates procurement lead time by providing visibility, traceability and transparency of transactions while improving governance and compliance with regulatory requirements. We implemented six (6) key modules: Sourcing Management, Scrap Management, Material Management, Product Inspection Management, Logistic Management & Customer Interactive Portal. In 2023, the system processed approximately 4,900 sourcing requests.

![](images/1637b8842d820a0cfb42c18737ddb58f8b0d4251bcdded1748d2bfbe02336748.jpg)

# Robotic Process Automation (RPA)

Since 2018, RPA has been implemented for the issuance of purchase orders to appointed contractors under the KKB and KPB programmes. This system promotes the fair award of works and services to these contractors. In 2023, the RPA issued approximately 35,000 purchase orders.

![](images/b6f03eda516b076d736adc5c98a8e085a70dffce769e6557603e66bcc1aafc09.jpg)

# Supply Chain Management

TNB recorded a substantial spending of approximately RM37 billion in 2023. The spend trend reflects a growth trajectory as Malaysia recovers from the post-pandemic era;  $46.45\%$  of our expenditures in 2023 was awarded to local vendors and suppliers.

Approximately RM25 billion was fuel-related, mainly on fuel gas sourced locally and coal fuel sourced internationally from foreign suppliers to ensure suitable coal quality for coal power generation in Malaysia. Of the non-fuel spending of RM11.6 billion, approximately  $91\%$  was from local suppliers.

We are dedicated to cultivating a supply chain ecosystem that meets and aspires to the highest standards of ethics, integrity, and transparency. Our commitment to these principles ensures that our procurement practices contribute to establishing a sustainable and responsible business environment.

# Recognition

We continuously seek feedback from our vendors through an annual vendor satisfaction survey. This enables us to better collaborate with our vendors to deliver quality products and services and provide a reliable electricity supply to our customers. In 2023, we achieved  $85\%$  vendor satisfaction.

# Cybersecurity Management

As we focus on better customer experience through digitalisation, we continue to strategically safeguard our Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) systems. Through these systems, we enable a reliable and secure supply of electricity to the nation. Our cybersecurity management aims to protect data confidentiality and integrity, as well as ensuring the availability of our critical IT and OT systems.

![](images/5b42ba80bd9ebb0f6d7763d87adfd7bc8a7d21cd43a469e83ff6104dc113d0ee.jpg)

We are vigilant in our efforts to protect the data privacy of our 10.14 million customers from unauthorised access and use. Our efforts include robust initiatives identified in our cybersecurity operating model and compliance with regulations such as the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) and industry standards.

![](images/3ec8d930ab21e4ac6af88745e5c8435ea540626dc78b6b06dae5bca455508990.jpg)

# Securing Our Data and Network Infrastructure

The cybersecurity management of our Information and Communications Technology (ICT) assets and services is governed by the TNB ICT Security Policy and ICT Code of Practice. The policy and code of practice ensure our employees are aware of their respective responsibilities and obligations in protecting the confidentiality, integrity, availability and authenticity of our ICT assets in the execution of day-to-day business operations.

We conduct around-the-clock monitoring of cyber threats to our systems to ensure the reliability of electricity supply and to protect company data, including the personal data of our customers. We are presently accredited with globally recognised cybersecurity standards, specifically the ISO/ IEC 27001:2013 Information Security Management System for TNB's key point installations and data centres. We also adopt IEC 62443 best practices that address cybersecurity mitigations for OT in automation and control systems. Additionally, we are certified in the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard for payment card transactions to secure our payment gateways and mitigate potential data theft and fraud.

We employ cloud services in our business operations, leveraging their scalability and accessibility advantages. To ensure our data security and privacy are of the highest standards, we ensure that these service providers comply with related international standards, such as ISO/IEC 27017, ISO/IEC 27018 and Service Organization Control Type 2 (SOC 2). We have established an Enterprise Data Governance (EDG) framework to ensure consistent management of information systems throughout the Group and for the safe handling of data sharing in compliance with the PDPA.

Being a responsible company that processes data for 10.14 million customers, a comprehensive process is in place to handle the potential loss of private customer data. Continuous data analysis is conducted to identify and rectify errors found in customer data in line with established policies and procedures. Other control measures include the utilisation of electronic Know Your Customer and digital signature solutions. In 2023, a PDPA e-learning module specifically tailored for Retail and Small Medium Enterprise and Residential employees was launched.

# Employment Culture

TNB firmly believes that every individual deserves equal opportunities and a supportive work environment. At TNB, we actively promote a culture of respect, understanding and acceptance.

![](images/4f247b301c4518ceaa7c2e9a05d1d801d56c92fd1fda36e7f8d652a10aa7f378.jpg)

We strive to create an inclusive workplace where all employees can thrive and contribute their unique perspectives and talents. Reimagining Culture (RC) was established to define our core values and culture - Integrity, Collaboration, Professionalism, Customer-centricity, Forward Thinking and Mindfulness - that drive our business transformation along with the development of a high-performance culture. As part of embracing Mindfulness, we are respectful and compassionate to others and the environment while protecting the safety and promoting the well-being of our people and the public.

![](images/e56447bd21d1b92e70e5b78e47899454645e947d4dd6bcaf878b15b9f04b1fb0.jpg)

# MANAGEMENT APPROACH

TNB is dedicated to fostering equal opportunities and a supportive work environment for every individual. We actively cultivate a culture of respect, understanding and acceptance, striving to create an inclusive workplace where all employees can thrive, bringing their unique perspectives and talents to the forefront.

TNB remains steadfast in adhering to all relevant labour laws, supporting the rights of freedom of association and collective bargaining as outlined in the Collective Agreement (CA). Both executive and non-executive employees' rights are safeguarded through our unions, ensuring improved working conditions. In 2023, we continued to engage and facilitate discussions to address employee concerns, enhance workplace culture, align with the company's direction and negotiate terms within the CA.

We place high importance on ensuring the safety of our employees and providing them with a safe working environment. This can be seen clearly through the improvement of our HSE performance in 2023, where we achieved our target of reducing our employee Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) to  $< 1.00$ , recording an LTIFR of 0.74 compared to 0.82 in 2022.

# SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURES ON MATERIAL MATTERS

# Diversity & Inclusion

The TNB Diversity & Inclusion policy, established in 2022, highlights our steadfast dedication to nurturing a diverse and inclusive work environment. We are committed to fostering a culture that values individuals irrespective of factors such as age, gender, race, religion, nationality, physical abilities, background or prior experiences. This commitment includes striving for a minimum of  $30\%$  female representation on our Board of Directors and promoting diversity among our senior management team. Our workforce comprises a mosaic of individuals with diverse backgrounds, talents and expertise, all strategically aligned with the company's objectives.

Moving forward, we are poised to introduce our comprehensive stance on labour rights. This initiative will employ a centralised and structured approach to safeguard the labour rights of our employees, emphasising key aspects such as diversity and inclusion, fair wages and benefits, upskilling and education, equitable treatment, safety and health, anti-corruption measures and a resolute stance against forced labour.

# $\triangleright$  Succession Management

Our succession management is a systematic process designed to identify, select and develop talents, ensuring a seamless operation of critical roles within our company. As of the end of 2023, we had successfully cultivated 31 "ready now" successors out of the 34 identified critical positions. Notably, our newly appointed C-Suites and Senior General Managers were drawn from this pool of successors. This achievement was acknowledged when we clinched Gold (first place) in the Best Succession Planning Strategy category at the Employee Experience Awards 2023 Malaysia, affirming the effectiveness of our strategic approach to succession planning.

# Capability Building

# Employee Learning and Development Journey

In ensuring that our people are equipped with the right capabilities, we continue to invest in our people.

Our learning and development programmes are based on three (3) principles:

70%

knowledge from challenging experiences and assignments

20%

from developmental relationships

10%

from formal training and coursework

![](images/a0c4cacf322e984508127f636661a7dff0f498429f2860cb09de900ca7b034eb.jpg)

This empowers our employees to chart their competency development in alignment with the learning journey identified for their respective roles.

The effectiveness of the employees' learning journey is further monitored through annual assessment cycles to gauge their proficiency levels over time. Both the employees and management are given the platform to discuss and identify any further improvement areas, which are needed in supporting the energy transition agenda. Through this exercise, TNB achieved an Organisational Competency Index of  $87.8\%$  in 2023.

# SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURES ON MATERIAL MATTERS

# Professional Certification

The technical competencies of our workforce play a pivotal role in driving our business operations. Our employees actively pursue relevant professional and specialist certifications within their respective fields. Additionally, they are encouraged to stay abreast of up-to-date industry standards and advancements in technology, fostering a culture of continuous learning and staying at the forefront of our rapidly evolving industry.

# Extended Study Programmes

Our employees are provided with the opportunity to further their academic studies through our study sponsorship initiative, which includes support for both undergraduate and postgraduate programmes. Additionally, we offer an in-house Employee Academic Development Programme. From 2021 to 2023, a total of 220 TNB employees actively participated in these programmes, reflecting our commitment to their continuous learning and development. This initiative represents a substantial investment, totalling RM1.2 million.

In summary, we continue to invest in our workforce capabilities:

# Flexible Working Arrangements

In 2023, we were steadfast in implementing the Group-wide TNB Ways of Working (TWOW), empowering our employees to adopt a hybrid work model, seamlessly transitioning either working in the office, at home or home-based. This approach fosters a flexible work environment that prioritises inclusivity, acknowledging employees' individual needs without compromising productivity or business performance. Our implementation of TWOW is facilitated through digitalisation, particularly through the use of the People app, which earned us the prestigious Gold award (first place) in the Best Hybrid Work Model category at the Employee Experience Awards 2023 Malaysia. Additionally, the app plays a pivotal role in facilitating reporting on GHG Scope 3 emissions, specifically in Category 6 (Business Travel) and Category 7 (Employee Commuting).

# Employee Engagement Assessment and Culture Barometer

The TNB employee engagement survey, conducted annually, aims to provide insights into our strengths and areas for improvement to enhance the overall employee experience, with a focus on our corporate culture. In 2023, an impressive  $90\%$  of our employees participated in the survey, resulting in a commendable score of  $89\%$ . This signifies a consistent upward trajectory since 2021, reaching the highest recorded score. Notably, this achievement matches the previous record highs attained in 2019 and 2020, prior to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

# Physical Risk

We have assessed the physical climate risk exposure to our business operations linked to extreme weather patterns and increased global temperatures. These include event-driven acute risks and longer-term chronic shifts in climate patterns.

The recent physical climate risk assessment is based on a climate scenario modelling (IPCC RCP  $8.5 / 4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ) for the three (3) different types of power generators (coal, gas & hydro) and substations selected given their locations within Peninsular Malaysia. The scenario modelling analysed climate-related failure and damage risks at the grid point of the asset sites chosen to identify the spatial distribution of the seven (7) physical climate risks. The summary outcome of the study is as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">Physical Risk</td><td rowspan="2">Description</td><td colspan="4">Risk Exposure</td></tr><tr><td>TNBJ</td><td>SPG</td><td>SJ Kenyir</td><td>100 substations</td></tr><tr><td>Coastal inundation</td><td>Rising sea levels and higher incidence of extreme sea events</td><td>●</td><td>●</td><td>●</td><td>●</td></tr><tr><td>Extreme wind</td><td>Changes in wind regimes, sea surface temperature and wind speeds</td><td>●</td><td>●</td><td>●</td><td>●</td></tr><tr><td>Forest fire</td><td>Increased incidence of fire weather due to confluence of days with higher temperatures, high wind speeds and drier conditions</td><td>●</td><td>●</td><td>●</td><td>●</td></tr><tr><td>Riverine flooding</td><td>Increased frequency and intensity of rainfall changing the frequency and intensity of river flooding</td><td>●</td><td>●</td><td>●</td><td>●</td></tr><tr><td>Soil movement</td><td>Changes in rainfall patterns and drought</td><td>●</td><td>●</td><td>●</td><td>●</td></tr><tr><td>Surface water flooding</td><td>Increased frequency of extreme rainfall leading to floods</td><td>●</td><td>●</td><td>●</td><td>●</td></tr><tr><td>Heat (dry spells)</td><td>Extreme high temperatures, more frequent hot days and longer-lasting heatwaves</td><td>●</td><td>●</td><td>●</td><td>●</td></tr><tr><td>Legend:</td><td colspan="5">● Risk exposure is low ● Risk exposure is moderate ● Risk exposure is significant ● Risk exposure is high</td></tr></table>

# OUR RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE

Based on the physical risk assessment, risks related to flood, heat, dry spells, and coastal inundation present a higher risk exposure to TNB's assets. With the possibility of increased exposure and impact severity, we are committed to improving our adaptation plans:

# CHAIRMAN'S INTRODUCTION TO CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Dear Shareholders,

I am pleased to present the Corporate Governance Overview Statement for 2023.

In alignment with our Corporate Governance Report, accessible on our corporate website, these statements highlight the Board's thorough assessment of the Group's operational landscape and strategic decisions aimed at securing a sustainable position for the benefit of our key stakeholders. This effort is bolstered by our commitment to upholding exemplary standards of corporate governance, deeply embedded within our organisational ethos.

The effectiveness of the Board's leadership is assessed by the transparency and clarity evident in our actions, underscored by the standards, procedures, and culture we establish. This transparent approach reflects our dedication to accountability and integrity across all aspects of our operations.

# ENGAGING AND RECONNECTING

In the past year, TNB introduced TNB Ways of Working (TWoW) to foster a more conducive work environment and address the needs of our workforce. Three (3) key components of TWoW include flexible and hybrid working arrangements, adaptable work hours, and a smart casual dress code, which became effective across TNB as of 1 January 2023. This initiative aligns with TNB's commitment to implementing flexible working practices throughout the organisation.

Further, we resumed hybrid meetings for the Board and its Committees, as well as for many shareholder engagements. The upcoming 2024 Annual General Meeting (AGM) will be conducted virtually, and I eagerly anticipate connecting with those who are able to attend, while also addressing queries from those joining us virtually.

The Board places significant emphasis on gathering input from employees, shareholders and broader stakeholders to ensure our actions resonate with those we collaborate with. This commitment is evident throughout this Integrated Annual Report, showcasing the extensive network through which we gather pertinent insights. At the Board level, we enhance our understanding of various perspectives through initiatives that complement our daily interactions within our business operations.

Our Board agenda also encompasses a stakeholder evaluation of our strategic direction, an annual update on supply chains, confirmation of sustainability priorities, and a comprehensive report on key stakeholder engagements. Notably, in 2023, our discussions included the development

Our operational strategy is deeply rooted in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) principles, ensuring our enduring commitment to sustainable practices. ESG targets are seamlessly integrated into our performance metrics via an ESG scorecard, reflecting their pivotal role in driving organisational objectives. Continuously striving for excellence, we've enhanced our reporting standards to align with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) index and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations.

The robust support from our Board Committees further showcases our dedication to sustainability. The renaming of the Board Risk Committee (BRC) to the Board Sustainability and Risk Committee (BSRC), effective 25 August 2023, signals our heightened emphasis on sustainability. Collaborating closely with the BSRC, the Board assumes responsibility for overseeing the strength of our sustainability and risk management frameworks, ensuring effective implementation to achieve strategic objectives and sustainability commitments.

Simultaneously, the Sustainability and Energy Transition Council (SETC) intensifies our focus on ESG index performance and scrutinises climate resilience and adaptation plans, further bolstering our commitment to sustainable practices. Moreover, the Board's endorsement of enhancements to the terms of reference of the Board Audit Committee (BAC), with a particular focus on sustainability-related matters, underscores our proactive approach.

For a comprehensive overview of our ESG initiatives and activities over the past year, please refer to the dedicated section titled "Sustainability Statement" within this report. Detailed information regarding our approach to ESG can also be found in our standalone Sustainability Report. These documents provide valuable insights into our ongoing commitment to sustainability and the measures we undertake to uphold ESG principles.

# CHAIRMAN'S INTRODUCTION TO

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

# EFFECTIVENESS

In my capacity as Chairman, I bear the responsibility and shall persist in providing leadership to ensure the effective operation of the Board. I am fortunate to have the support of all Directors in this endeavour. The annual Board Evaluation Assessment (BEA) serves as a valuable tool for the Board to reflect on its functioning and identify areas for enhancement. This year, the BEA was conducted by an independent expert in accordance with Practice 6.1 of the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance 2021 (MCCG). The findings from this assessment have yielded valuable insights that will guide us in further refining the operations and effectiveness of the Board.

# BOARD CHANGES

The Board is committed to maintaining a diverse mix of skills, experience and expertise to effectively fulfill its responsibilities and address the dynamic landscape ahead. With a keen eye on succession planning, we have established a robust process for selecting, nominating and appointing candidates to the Board.

Entrusted with this responsibility, the Board Nomination and Remuneration Committee (BNRC) rigorously evaluates potential candidates, considering their capabilities, commitment and suitability for Board and Committee roles. This evaluation encompasses a range of factors, including diversity, skillsets, backgrounds, relevant experience and fit and proper assessment, ensuring a well-rounded composition of Board members.

In line with our governance framework, the Board may appoint new Directors to fill vacancies or augment the existing Board structure. As per our Company's Constitution, the Minister of Finance (Incorporated) (MoF Inc.), our Special Shareholder, holds the authority to appoint up to six (6) Directors. Currently, our Board comprises 12 members, including one (1) Executive Director and 11 Non-Executive Directors, with six (6) Independent Directors.

These Independent Directors bring unbiased judgment, free from any conflicts of interest, ensuring robust decision-making processes. We continue to refine our Board composition, balancing experience, expertise and innovative perspectives.

Several changes have occurred within the Board during the reporting period. Prior to the commencement of the  $33^{\text{rd}}$  Annual General Meeting on 18 May 2023, Datuk Rawisandran Narayanan expressed his intention, not to seek for re-election as an Independent Non-Executive Director, as per Clause 64(1) of the Company's Constitution. Consequently, Ordinary Resolution 3 regarding his re-election as a Director was withdrawn at the AGM.

In the course of the Financial Year, Muazzam bin Mohamad assumed the role of Non-Independent Non-Executive Director, representing Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB), a major shareholder of TNB, effective 1 July 2023. With over 15 years of experience at PNB, Muazzam has spearheaded numerous initiatives in corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions and corporate strategy, emphasising sustainability and governance. His appointment underscores our commitment to responsible investment practices.

Shortly thereafter, Datuk Amran Hafiz bin Affifudin resigned as Non-Independent Non-Executive Director, representing Khazanah Nasional Berhad (Khazanah), a major shareholder of TNB, effective 1 September 2023. Concurrently, Elaine Ong Yee Lynn concluded her role as Alternate Director to Datuk Amran Hafiz bin Affifudin, as stipulated in Clause 61(2) of the Company's Constitution. Selvendran Katheerayson was subsequently appointed as Non-Independent Non-Executive Director, representing Khazanah, effective 1 September 2023.

Selpendran brings a wealth of experience from his tenure as Executive Director, Head of Real Assets & Property at Khazanah. His appointment reflects our commitment to strengthening governance and maximizing shareholder value. Elaine Ong Yee Lynn was reappointed as Alternate Director to Selpendran Katheerayson with effect from 24 November 2023.

Furthermore, upon the conclusion of Dato' Seri Ir. Baharin bin Din's service tenure as President/Chief Executive Officer (President/CEO), Datuk Ir. Megat Jalaluddin bin Megat Hassan was appointed by the Board with the concurrence of MoF Inc. as President/CEO and Non-Independent Executive Director of TNB for a two-year term, effective 1 March 2024. Datuk Ir. Megat Jalaluddin brings extensive experience and industry knowledge, having served in various leadership capacities within TNB.

The Board on 27 February 2024 had approved the appointment of Ramzi bin Mansor who is the Deputy Secretary General of Treasury (Management) in the Ministry of Finance as Non-Independent Non-Executive Director representing the interest of MoF Inc. with effect from 1 March 2024. He was appointed in place of Datin Rashidah binti Mohd Sies, who had resigned effective 12 January 2024, due to her retirement in public services.

A recent addition to the Board is the appointment of Dato' Zulkifli bin Ibrahim as Independent Non-Executive Director with effect from 1 April 2024. He possesses technical expertise and experience in generation operation and maintenance, that would fill up the gap identified through the Board Skills Matrix.

# CHAIRMAN'S INTRODUCTION TO CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

As we welcome our new Board members and leadership, we express our gratitude to departing Directors for their dedication and service to the Company. We are confident that with the collective expertise and vision of our Board, we will continue to steer TNB towards success, creating long-term value for our stakeholders.

The Board adheres to Paragraph 15.02 (1)(a)&(b) of the Main Market Listing Requirements of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad (MMLR), of having  $50\%$  of Independent Directors and five (5) female Directors, surpassing the requirements set by the MMLR.

The Board and BNRC continuously undertake thorough reviews of the Board Skills Matrix. This assessment aids in identifying the necessary skills, knowledge, experience and capabilities essential for addressing current and future challenges within the Company. It aims to maintain a well-rounded mix of expertise to effectively tackle business compliance and governance matters, thereby enabling Directors to conduct comprehensive evaluations of Management's performance.

Following the BNRC's recommendation, the Board approved measures to enhance the Board's composition for greater dynamism. Addressing critical skills and competency gaps, such as technical proficiency, international business acumen and customer-centricity, remains a priority. All Directors appointed during the Financial Year under review possess the requisite skills, aligning with the strategic needs of the Company.

By having a balanced blend of skills, experience, knowledge and independence, the Board is confident in its ability to execute the Group's strategy effectively. This balance empowers the Non-Executive Directors to rigorously challenge Management's perspectives and proposals while ensuring compliance with the principle of good governance.

# DIVERSITY

The Board remains deeply committed to promoting diversity within the Company's senior management. It conducts annual reviews to evaluate recommendations on diversity for these crucial roles. Recognising the continuous need for advancement, this commitment extends beyond the Board level to include the Senior Leadership tier.

Presently, the representation of women on the Board stands at five (5) members, constituting  $42\%$ , surpassing the  $30\%$  benchmark recommended by the MCCG. However, within the broader organisation, women comprise  $21\%$  of the workforce. Gender balance varies across roles, geographies, and bands with female representation within our leadership stands at  $26\%$ .

Although commendable progress has been achieved in different aspects of diversity and inclusion across the Group, ensuring sustainable change requires a resolute, long-term strategy, which remains a key focus for the Company.

# LOOKING FORWARD

In conclusion, the importance of robust corporate governance cannot be underestimated as we chart our course forward. Serving as the bedrock of our operations, it steers us towards enduring growth and prosperity. As we progress, our focus remains on strengthening our governance mechanisms, continuously refining and adapting them to meet the evolving needs of our organisation and the expectations of our stakeholders. By aligning our governance practices with our strategic and operational objectives, we not only bolster the confidence of our investors and partners but also cultivate an environment of accountability and transparency. This dedication to sound corporate governance ensures that we remain committed to delivering long-term, sustainable value for all those we serve.

# BOARD LEADERSHIP & EFFECTIVENESS

# SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE

In advancing our sustainability agenda and achieving our net zero objectives, a robust sustainability governance framework and resolute leadership structure are paramount. Aligned with the tenets of the MCCG, our sustainability governance is deeply ingrained within TNB's Governance Model, serving as a cornerstone of our organisational principles.

Underlining the importance of a resilient sustainability governance framework, coupled with effective leadership, we uphold these elements as essential for informed and inclusive decision-making processes. Integrated seamlessly within the broader TNB Group Governance Platform, our sustainability governance framework is intricately linked with TNB's management committees and subcommittees, reinforcing its pivotal role within our corporate governance framework.

During a special meeting on 11 September 2023, the Board approved the renaming of the BRC to the BSRC, effective from 25 August 2023. This decision was accompanied by enhanced terms of reference, encompassing the oversight of sustainability practices in alignment with the Bursa Malaysia Sustainability Reporting Guide  $3^{\text{rd}}$  Edition. With the support of the BSRC, the Board assumes responsibility for ensuring the robustness of our sustainability and risk management frameworks, as well as the effectiveness of their implementation in achieving strategic objectives and sustainability commitments.

Furthermore, on 14 December 2023, the Board endorsed the revised terms of reference for the BAC to adapt to its evolving role, particularly in providing assurance on sustainability-related matters. The updated functions and responsibilities of the BAC in relation to sustainability matters include ensuring the consistency and coherence of sustainability-related disclosures across financial reporting and other public disclosures, approving the assurance plan/methodology on the Sustainability Statement, and reviewing the results of assurance on the Sustainability Statement, culminating in the approval of the Statement of Assurance as part of the Sustainability Statement.

The Board assumes a critical role in overseeing the Company's strategic trajectory and sanctioning corporate strategic endeavours devised by the Management. Anually, the Board scrutinises the Company's strategic and business plan, including the proposed annual capital and revenue budget for the upcoming year, alongside the KPIs. This ensures that the KPIs align with the Company's annual strategic and business plan. The Board thoroughly evaluates and deliberates on the Management's perspectives and assumptions to ensure informed decisions are made, considering all relevant factors.

Additionally, an informal session known as the Board Breakout Session (BBO) serves as a platform for the Board and Management

to exchange views and opinions, formulate strategic plans and address pertinent issues concerning the Group's direction and progress. Coordinated by the Company Secretary's Office, with input from respective Divisions, as required, the BBO facilitates strategic planning and progress reporting.

Throughout the Financial Year, the Board conducted three (3) BBOs, with a focus on TNB's ESG Strategy:

- On 13 February 2023: Deliberations on the Subsidiary Way Forward for TNB's Sustainability Agenda by the Strategy & Ventures Division, addressing TNB's subsidiaries in manufacturing, infrastructure, and services. Proposed

# Identifying and managing principal risks affecting the Company

# Matters Considered by the Board

The Board, through the BSRC, holds the mandate to oversee the strength of the Group's sustainability and risk management frameworks and the efficacy of their implementation to realise strategic objectives and sustainability commitments.

Throughout the Financial Year, the BSRC convened nine (9) sitings, focusing on various aspects of risk management and internal controls. Deliberations included a review of the Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control, which encapsulates Management's risk management practices and internal controls, along with discussions on Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) aligned with the BSRC's and Management's risk appetite.

The BSRC receives support from the Chief Risk Officer and the Risk Management

Department (RMD) in fulfilling its duties. The RMD ensures the effective implementation of the TNB Risk Management Framework, aligned with ISO 31000:2018, to facilitate informed decision-making.

With the establishment of the Sustainability Division during the Financial Year, tasked with executing TNB's ESG Sustainability Initiative Strategy, the RMD now reports directly to the BSRC, with administrative reporting to the Chief Sustainability Officer. This integration ensures alignment between risk management and sustainability efforts.

A significant event during the year was the TNB Top Management Risk Forum, organised by the RMD under the theme "Building TNB Resiliency through Effective Risk Management." Attended by BSRC members,

the Group Executive Management Committee, and Senior Management, the forum aimed to cascade BSRC's risk management directives to TNB's senior leadership, fostering a robust risk culture across the Group.

The BSRC remains committed in its oversight role, ensuring that risk management is seamlessly integrated into strategic planning and decision-making processes to drive the Group's strategic outcomes and long-term objectives.

Based on the evaluation for the Financial Year under review, the Board collectively agreed that it has discharged its roles in identifying principal risks and in ensuring that the Group has put in place an adequate risk management framework to effectively monitor and manage the risks of its operational businesses.

# RE-ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

Clause 64(1) of the Company's Constitution provides, among others, that one-third (1/3) of the Directors at the time being of whom have been longest in office shall retire by rotation at the AGM of the Company and shall be eligible for re-election.

Clause 63(2) of the Company's Constitution provides, among others, that the Directors shall have power at any time and from time to time to appoint any other person to be a Director of the Company either to fill a casual vacancy or as an addition to the existing Directors. Any Director so appointed shall hold office only until the next following AGM of the Company and shall then be eligible for re-election.

Ong Ai Lin and Dato' Roslina binti Zainal are retiring by rotation in accordance with Clause 64(1) of the Company's Constitution and being eligible, have offered themselves for re-election.

The Board recognises that the Directors' performance are used as basis in recommending their re-election to the shareholders. This, in turn, is determined through their annual evaluation and independence assessment, which were assessed by the BNRC before any recommendation was made to the Board for deliberation and approval.

Based on the annual independence assessment undertaken by both Ong Ai Lin and Dato' Roslina binti Zainal who are retiring at the coming AGM, the BNRC/Board are satisfied that these Independent Directors have complied with the independence criteria as prescribed by the MMLR and continue to bring independent and objective judgement to the Board.

They have exercised the duty of care and diligence as Directors in the best interest of the Company, its shareholders and stakeholders. Through the Board Evaluation Assessment including Self and Peer Assessment, they have met the performance criteria required of an effective and high-performance Board.

In respect of the new appointments made to the Board during the Financial Year, Selvendran Katheerayson, Muazzam bin Mohamad, Datuk Ir. Megat Jalaluddin bin Megat Hassan, Ramzi bin Mansor and Dato' Zulkifli bin Ibrahim shall retire at the forthcoming AGM in accordance with Clause 63(2) of the Company's Constitution and being eligible, have offered themselves for re-election.

Datuk Ir. Megat Jalaluddin bin Megat Hassan and Ramzi bin Mansor are Appointed Directors of MoF Inc. while Selvendran Katheerayson and Muazzam bin Mohamad represent Khazanah and PNB respectively.

In addition, all retiring Directors have declared that they did not have any existing or potential conflict of interest including any interest in any competing business within the Company or its subsidiaries that could affect the execution of their roles as Company Directors.

Having considered their fit and proper assessment including declaration of conflict of interest, due diligence for the newly appointed Directors, professionalism, vast experience, material relationship, competency, commitment and individuals' contributions in performing their respective duties, the Board and the BNRC are satisfied that all Directors who are standing for re-election at the  $34^{\text{th}}$  AGM have met the Board's expectation by continuously discharging their duties diligently as Company Directors.

With that, upon the BNRC's assessment, the Board resolved to support and recommend the re-election of each Director who is retiring at the upcoming  $34^{\text{th}}$  AGM.

# BOARD LEADERSHIP & EFFECTIVENESS

# DIRECTORS' DEVELOPMENT AND INDUCTION

In supporting the Board's responsibilities, a comprehensive training and development programme is extended to all Directors, with the assessment of training needs embedded within the Board evaluation procedure. This programme encompasses regular presentations from Management and informal meetings, fostering a profound understanding of the business, sector dynamics, and areas acknowledged for their technical complexity. The training initiatives aim to not only deepen comprehension but also endow Non-Executive Directors with insights into how TNB's practices compared with those of its peers.

A robust induction programme is crafted for all new Directors, featuring tailored components such as meetings with Top Management, site visits and briefings on key operational matters, Board procedures, and governance issues. Ensuring a cohesive knowledge base, existing Directors, including the Alternate Director, had attended the Mandatory Accreditation Programme Part I (in relation to a Director's roles, duties and liabilities) (MAP Part I). In addition, all existing Directors had attended the Mandatory Accreditation Programme Part II in relation to sustainability and the related roles of a Director (MAP Part II).

The newly appointed Directors namely Datuk Ir. Megat Jalaluddin bin Megat Hassan, Ramzi bin Mansor and Dato' Zulkifli bin Ibrahim shall attend the MAP Part I and MAP Part II respectively within the timeframe as stipulated in Paragraph 15.08 and Practice Note 5 of the MMLR.

Facilitating the Board in organising both internal and external programmes and seminars relevant to Directors' needs is a responsibility shouldered by the Company Secretary's Office. This includes the annual in-house Board Development Programme (BDP), an integral component of TNB's ongoing Board Continuing Development Programme.

BDP 2023 was held in collaboration with Messrs. PricewaterhouseCoopers PLT Malaysia, led by its Sustainability and Climate Change team with the theme "Awareness on Sustainability Reporting for the Board of Directors". It was held on 8 September 2023 at Pusat Konvensyen Leo Moggie, TNB Platinum, No. 3, Jalan Bukit Pantai, 59100 Kuala Lumpur and attended by the Board and Top Management. The topic was relevant as it discussed on Sustainability Reporting Landscape for Corporate Malaysia, customised for TNB's Board of Directors.

Prior to that, the Integrity Department, assisted by the Company Secretary's Office, organised a specific programme, "The Law Behind Corporate Governance" by Malaysian Institute Of Corporate Governance (MICG) on 4 September 2023 at M Resort & Hotel Kuala Lumpur for the Board and Top Management to keep abreast with the principles and best practices of corporate governance. This was in line with the TCP 2023 approved by the BIC, which required Integrity Department to organise specific training for the Board and Top Management once in the third quarter of 2023.

Apart from the BDP 2023, the Company Secretary's Office in collaboration with Asia School of Business on 20 November 2023 held a Continuous Development Programme for the Top Management and TNB Subsidiaries' Board Of Directors on "What Amount To A Conflict Of Interest By Directors". This capability-building initiative specially designed to provide TNB Nominee Directors with the necessary support to enhance their governance skill, proficiency and governing approach to enable them to act accordingly within the powers bestowed on them in the best interest of the Company and in good faith. It was also to address the enhancement to Conflict of Interest (COI) disclosures made by Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad in order to improve the quality of COI disclosures of Directors and key senior management and to promote better corporate governance practices and accountability.

# BOARD EVALUATION

Acknowledging the transformative potential of an objective and well-managed board evaluation process, the Board acknowledges its pivotal role in enhancing Board effectiveness, thereby delivering substantial benefits to the Company. This commitment is manifested through annual performance evaluations, thoughtfully designed induction programs for new Board members and a continuous stream of Board development activities.

In 2023, the Board with the assistance of BNRC, had engaged an Independent Expert for Board Evaluation Assessment FY2023 in support of Practice 6.1 of MCCG whereby for Large Companies, the Board engages independent expert at least every three (3) years, to facilitate objective and candid board evaluations. The last assessment carried out by the independent expert was in 2021. This strategic approach aims to facilitate impartial and candid Board evaluations, fostering a culture of transparency and accountability within the organisation.

# 2023 BOARD EVALUATION ASSESSMENT RESULTS

The 2023 BEA included, but not limited to the following areas:

Board leadership and roles  
Board composition, skills and development  
Board governance and processes  
Board dynamics and culture  
- Board and Management relationship/Stakeholders' engagement  
- Board & support functions

# BOARD LEADERSHIP & EFFECTIVENESS

The 2023 BEA was conducted through questionnaires via Online Survey System. The questionnaires for the 2023 BEA comprised the Board, Board Committees Effectiveness Assessment, Directors and Board Committee members' Self and Peer Assessment (SPA), as well as a 360 Degree Assessment by Top Management. In addition, the newly Appointed Directors had also completed online Saville Wave Assessments to understand their respective and collective stewardship styles and one-on-one online/physical interview sessions were conducted with all Directors.

The overall effectiveness of the Board is assessed in the areas of Corporate Strategy and Direction Setting, Board Governance and Oversight, Board Composition, Boardroom Conduct and Dynamics, Board Management and Operation as well as its Key Priorities as well as the effectiveness of the Chairman.

The assessment of individual Directors' contribution and performance is conducted based on performance criteria of which among others are as follows:

will and ability to critically challenge and ask the right questions;  
confidence to stand up for a point of view and offer advice/guidance;  
- character and integrity in dealing with potential conflict of interest situations;  
calibre and personality;  
commitment to serve the Company;  
due diligence and integrity;  
- fit and properness;  
independence and objectivity;  
skills and competencies; and  
- contribution and performance.

The BEA also included the evaluation of dynamics and culture of the Board especially new Directors' impact to the overall leadership and risk profile balance. The effectiveness of Board Committees is assessed in terms of structure and processes, accountabilities and responsibilities and its dynamic/composition as well as the effectiveness of the Chairmen of respective Board Committees. The SPA for the Board Committee members is similar to the Directors' SPA, which is intended to assess their contribution, performance, calibre and personality in relation to the skills, experience and other qualities they bring to the Board/Board Committees.

The SPA also examines the ability of each Board or Committee member to give input at meetings and to demonstrate a high level of professionalism and integrity in the decision-making process. It also takes into account the ability of each individual member to exercise independent judgement

and demonstrate objectivity and clarity of thought on issues during deliberations at meetings, provide logical honest opinion and offer practical and realistic advice to the discussions.

The feedback from the Top Management was also being sought via the 360 Degree Assessment questionnaires and interviews. The Management's feedback on the Board's role and the extent of collaboration between the Board and Management in certain focus areas and in the review/decision-making process are useful for the Board's consideration in enhancing its overall effectiveness.

Based on the 2023 BEA results, the Board demonstrated solid performance with an overall rating of 4.3 across various effectiveness indicators, including Corporate Strategy & Direction Setting, Board Governance & Oversight, Board Composition, Boardroom Conduct & Dynamics, and Board Management & Operations. Peer assessments further underscored the Directors' performance with a notable average score of 4.6, indicating that each Director was generally effective in dispensing his/her responsibilities.

Building upon the insights from the 2022 BEA, the Board continued to showcase strong and effective leadership in 2023. It was highlighted by both the Board and Management that there was a clear distinction of roles and responsibilities of the Chairman and President/CEO, signalling robust and effective leadership in guiding the Company's direction. Dato' Abdul Razak bin Abdul Majid was rated as a highly effective Chairman demonstrating decisiveness and an action-oriented approach while creating an open and consultative environment within the Board and effectively delegating responsibilities to Directors, Board Committees and Management.

The Board was seen to be effective in ensuring the integrity of the Company is aligned with regulatory requirements, internal standards and best practices. The Board was committed to its fiduciary duties and assumed the core responsibilities of reviewing and monitoring the Group's strategic plan, overseeing and evaluating the conduct of the Group's business and establishing sound risk management and internal control frameworks for the Group.

Moving forward, the Board recognises the need to establish a clear and well-defined succession plan for both the Board and Top Management, ensuring that the composition, structure and diversity is in line with TNB's strategic direction. Additionally, the Board recognises the necessity of refining processes to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of both the Board and its Committees, actively seeking opportunities for continuous improvement.

# EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND TOP MANAGEMENT REMUNERATION

The compensation structure for the Executive Director is designed to correlate rewards with both corporate and individual performance. It encompasses salary, allowances, bonuses, and customary benefits aligned with industry standards. A significant part of the Executive Director's compensation is variable and contingent upon annual performance against individual KPIs embedded in a scorecard aligned with Board-approved corporate objectives. Notably, the Executive Director abstains from participating in discussions and voting on his remuneration during Board meetings.

The BNRC conducts an annual review of the Executive Director's performance, submitting informed views and recommendations to the Board regarding potential adjustments in remuneration or rewards, reflecting the Executive Director's contributions to the Group's achievements for the year.

Top Management's remuneration package comprises three (3) distinct components: the base salary, fixed allowances and benefits, the Short Term Incentive (STI) and the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). The base salary is set competitively, considering the scope of work, experience, and anticipated performance. Fixed allowances are separate from the base salary and are granted for specific cash benefits.

The STI, contingent on annual performance, is disbursed as bonuses, contingent upon the Company's profitability and the performance of Top Management. Evaluation criteria include quantitative targets and qualitative alignment with the Company's values. The LTIP is designed to retain and reward Top Management, aligning their interests with the long-term success of the Company.

# BOARD LEADERSHIP & EFFECTIVENESS

TNB places a strong emphasis on a performance-driven culture, where the remuneration policy aims to compensate competitively for sustained performance, aligning with shareholders' interests. The Company, in adherence to Practice 8.2 of the MCCG, opts not to disclose specific components of Top Management's remuneration, citing potential disadvantages to the Company's business interests. Further details can be found in the Corporate Governance Report.

# NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION

Non-Executive Directors receive compensation in the form of fixed monthly fees, meeting allowances and benefits-in-kind, covering items such as the reimbursement of utilities bills and business peripherals.

The remuneration for Non-Executive Directors is calibrated to address the current challenging landscape in fulfilling their fiduciary duties, roles, and responsibilities. The remuneration structure takes into account the intricacies of the Company's operations and the industry at large. Notably, the remuneration and benefits for Non-Executive Directors have remained consistent since 2013.

The Board in 2023 had engaged an independent expert to conduct a holistic and independent review of the Non-Executive Directors' Remuneration with the view to determine its market competitiveness and alignment with the latest regulations/corporate governance guidelines in Malaysia. The selected peer group used for benchmarking for this year's study was chosen based on a set of guiding principles that was consistent with the previous study, that consist of the top largest companies by market capitalisation.

The key principles used in determining the appropriate remuneration framework for the Non-Executive Directors' Remuneration, among others were to reflect the complexity, responsibility and accountability of the roles with increasing regulatory demands of Bursa Malaysia and Securities Commission, TNB's national importance, the competitiveness to attract and retain the talent profiles and to reflect the time and effort dedicated of their roles on the Board and Board Committees.

Based on the findings, TNB's Directors' fee competitiveness would be between the P50 and P75 of the market. Subsequently, the Board/BNRC agreed to retain the existing Non-Executive Directors' Remuneration and it is to be reviewed in three (3) years' time.

<table><tr><td>The Directors&#x27; Remuneration Policy is shaped by the following underlying principles:</td></tr><tr><td>Remuneration policy</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed remuneration</td></tr><tr><td>Benefits-in-kind</td></tr><tr><td>Alignment with strategy and business objectives</td></tr><tr><td>Alignment with shareholders&#x27; interest</td></tr><tr><td>Long-term success of the Company</td></tr><tr><td>Consistency and transparency</td></tr><tr><td>Reward performance with competitive remuneration</td></tr><tr><td>Alignment with market/industry practices</td></tr><tr><td>Support Company values</td></tr></table>

# EFFECTIVE AUDIT AND RISK MANAGEMENT

# ETHICS, INTEGRITY & TRUST

In 2017, TNB was one of the first listed corporations to embark on the ISO 37001:2016 Anti-Bribery Management System (ABMS) certification. Towards achieving the certification, TNB launched the TNB Corporate Integrity Management System (TCIMS) to drive an integrity-based culture and a high level of compliance with local and international anti-bribery standards. On 15 November 2018, TNB was awarded with the ABMS Certification from SIRIM and to further reinforce this culture, launched the TCIMS Handbook. TNB has a well thought out set of Shared Values made publicly available and communicated to the workforce. First among the TNB Shared Values is Integrity. The three (3) behaviours of Integrity are:

# 3 BEHAVIOURS OF INTEGRITY

We uphold the highest ethical standards and do what is right, all the time

We are fair, honest and transparent in everything we do

We always seek to achieve mutual benefit for the country, Company and customers

The TCIMS covers four (4) main policies, namely the Anti-Bribery Policy; the Gifts, Hospitality and Related Benefits Policy; the Conflicts of Interest Policy; and the Whistleblowing Policy.

In 2022, TNB reviewed these four (4) main policies to reflect the current policies, circulars and practices.

During the Financial Year under review, surveillance audits by SIRIM were conducted involving the Retail Division and four (4) wholly-owned subsidiaries of TNB, namely Malaysia Transformer Manufacturing Sdn. Bhd. (MTM), TNB Integrated Learning Solution Sdn. Bhd. (ILSAS), TNB Fuel Services Sdn. Bhd. (TNBF) and TNB Repair and Maintenance Sdn. Bhd. (REMACO). There were two (2) recertification audits by SIRIM conducted for Procurement & Supply Chain Division (P&SC) and a subsidiary of TNB, Tenaga Cable Industries Sdn. Bhd. (TCI). All the entities successfully retained the ISO 37001 Anti-Bribery Management System certification by SIRIM.

In 2022, TNB signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) and signed the Corruption Free Pledge. This pledge emphasises the pledges and promises made by the leadership of TNB and its staff voluntarily in their capacity as an organisation to ensure that each of us will be more responsible in carrying out our duties and curbing corruption.

TNB has conducted the Integrity Health Survey in 2023 through UNITEN R & D Sdn. Bhd. where 25,680 staff have participated and based on the survey TNB received a  $87.16\%$  score as opposed  $79.36\%$  in 2022. TNB has also established a systematic approach through the Annual Training and Communication Plan (TCP) for the areas of improvement identified through the Integrity Health Survey conducted in 2022.

In 2023, all activities under the TCP were successfully completed including Seminar for Boards and Top Management. A series of trainings and awareness sessions were conducted by Integrity Department to better equip the Company in line with the implementation of Section 17A of the MACC Act 2009. These included the following:

TNB Integrity Day 2023  
Related programs to Divisions/Departments and Subsidiaries  
- Five (5) sessions of Fraud and Bribery Risk Management workshop  
- All staff and active vendors/contractors were required to complete Integrity E-Learning  
- All staff are required to sign the integrity pledge, declare any conflicts of interest annually and specifically when a conflict arises  
Joint integrity programs with MACC  
Published 12 Integrity bulletins and e-poster

# LIMITS OF AUTHORITY

The Limits of Authority lays down guiding principles governing decision-making throughout the Group, emphasizing the escalation and reporting procedures to the Board. Delegating authority is a key aspect, with the Board entrusting the President/CEO and other Executives to oversee the Company's day-to-day activities. This delegation includes the responsibility to recommend and approve both monetary and non-monetary limits of authority for operational and management decisions before execution. The Limits of Authority strikes a balance between effective oversight and empowering the Management with appropriate accountability.

# CODE OF ETHICS FOR DIRECTORS

The Board of Directors adheres to the Code of Ethics for Company Directors established by the Companies Commission of Malaysia. Each Non-Executive Director is equipped with the Non-Executive Directors' Handbook, serving as a reference for their professional responsibilities and the terms and conditions of their service. This handbook undergoes regular updates to reflect changes in applicable rules, regulations, and policies governing Directors' conduct.

# CODE OF BUSINESS ETHICS (COBE)

In 2023, TNB launched the Code of Business Ethics (COBE) and Organisational Anti-Corruption Plan (OACP) to strengthen the practice of integrity in TNB.

![](images/b9516a7376f70be04ebdae221e498446391a425bb537f197067b9ec7782f0f63.jpg)

TNB has developed the new COBE to govern the conduct of all Directors and employees which take effect on 25 August 2023. This code ensures adherence to laws and regulations, promotes sound employment practices, upholds confidentiality and privacy, and addresses matters such as conflicts of interest, business courtesies, and the proper use of TNB's assets. It also outlines how TNB engages with its shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers, and the communities in which it operates, emphasizing general principles of business integrity. All employees are expected to conduct business in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, contributing to the enhancement and protection of TNB's reputation.

# EFFECTIVE AUDIT AND RISK MANAGEMENT

# ETHICS, INTEGRITY & TRUST

The Procurement Code of Conduct serves as a guiding framework for TNB's Directors and employees, as well as suppliers/contractors and their personnel. TNB places a strong emphasis on principles such as integrity, accountability, fairness, and a zero-tolerance approach towards bribery and corruption in all supplier/contractor relationships. This code undergoes regular revisions to align with changes in regulations, reputational demands, and evolving business challenges.

Additionally, the Procurement & Supply Chain Policy and Procedures provide comprehensive guidance for executing procurement within TNB. This policy framework enables TNB to achieve optimal value, adopt leading business practices, prioritise business objectives, add value to customers, and maintain high standards of corporate governance. Both TNB's COBE and Procurement Code of Conduct are accessible on the respective sections of the Company's website at www.tnb.com.my.

# CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (COI)

In upholding principles of ethical and independent decision-making and the enhancement to the existing COI disclosures as required by the MMLR, the Directors and Top Management are required to disclose on the nature and extent of any COI or potential COI, including interest in any competing business that the person has with TNB and its subsidiaries.

Directors or Top Management with such interests are required to declare them immediately and at the respective meetings to be abstained from participating in the deliberations, in ensuring impartial decision-making. Mitigation actions shall be taken upon any declaration of COI by the Directors or Top Management, with the concurrence of the President/CEO/Chairman/Senior Independent Director. In addition, TNB Directors, Top Management and its Boards of Subsidiaries are required to make COI declaration annually and on adhoc basis. Currently the Integrity Department, Company Secretary's Office, Legal Services Department and Internal Audit Department are jointly developing the COI guidelines/ framework in ensuring it fulfills the enhancement to the existing COI disclosures as prescribed by the MMLR.

As practice by the Procurement & Supply Chain Division in collaboration with the Integrity Department, each Director shall sign an Integrity Pledge during every BTC/Board meeting. This commitment entails a declaration of any interests related to procurement or matters on the meeting agenda, underscoring the Company's dedication to preventing corruption, mitigating conflicts of interest and safeguarding the confidentiality of information.

# WHISTLEBLOWING PROCEDURE

The Whistleblowing Procedure underscores TNB's commitment to fostering an open working environment, where employees, contractors and members of the public can confidentially report instances of unethical, unlawful or undesirable conduct without fear of intimidation or reprisal. An independent investigation team examines all reported concerns and where applicable, offers feedback on the outcome of the investigation.

The objectives of the Whistleblowing Procedure are threefold:

- To identify and address unacceptable conduct.  
- To cultivate a supportive working environment that empowers employees and contractors to raise legitimate concerns with both personal and organisational implications.  
- To safeguard individuals who, in good faith, report unacceptable conduct from any adverse consequences.

Reporting channels are made easily accessible through the Online Whistleblowing Information System (WBIS) at http://wbis.tnb.com.my. Alternatively, reports can be submitted via email to the designated officers using the Whistleblowing Complaint Form, available in both Malay and English.

# ANTI-BRIBERYPOLICY

TNB is resolute in articulating its position on bribery and related matters, establishing essential pillars within its framework to fortify the Company against any manifestation of bribery. All forms of bribery related to TNB's activities are unequivocally prohibited. Upholding integrity is a collective responsibility that extends across all levels of personnel.

Guided by a stringent 'No Gifts' policy, TNB emphasises integrity through the regular signing of Integrity Pledges and the declaration of conflicts of interest by personnel. While certain exceptions may exist, TNB ensures that these policies are consistently adhered to. Prudent management of business associates acting on behalf of the Company further enhances TNB's commitment to ethical conduct.

The reporting of misconduct by personnel or third parties is not only encouraged but expected, with robust protection in place for those acting in good faith as whistleblowers. Enforcing its position on ethical standards, TNB entrusts the Integrity Department with the responsibility of upholding and reinforcing these principles.

The TCIMS undergoes periodic assessments and updates to ensure its continued effectiveness in upholding the Company's commitment to ethical business practices. This proactive approach reflects TNB's dedication to maintaining the highest standards of integrity in its operations.

Financial Year under review is on page 148 of this

Integrated Annual Report.

The Board Audit Committee (BAC) was established to assist the Board to carry out their oversight and fiduciary duties and responsibilities.

BAC's objectives, authorities and functions are governed by the Terms of Reference (ToR). The ToR was last reviewed in November 2023 and approved by TNB's Board in December 2023. The ToR is accessible on the Company's official website at www.tnb.com.my.

# MEMBERSHIP AND MEETINGS

As of 31 December 2023, the BAC comprises three (3) Independent and one (1) Non-Independent Directors, all of whom are Non-Executive Directors. This composition is aligned with Paragraph 15.09 (1) (a) and (b) of the Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad Main Market Listing Requirements (MMLR), which states that the Audit Committee must be composed of not fewer than three (3) members and all the Audit Committee members must be Non-Executive Directors, with a majority of them being Independent Directors.

The BAC is chaired by Dato' Merina binti Abu Tahir effective 1 February 2022. The BAC remains committed in adhering to the practice outlined in the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance (MCCG) 2021, whereby the Chairman of BAC was not the Chairman of TNB Board during the year under review.

In FY2023, a total of 13 BAC meetings were conducted, fulfilling the stipulation in BAC ToR that mandates a minimum of six (6) meetings per year. Attendance at all meetings met the requisite quorum as stipulated in the BAC ToR.

The Company Secretary who is the Secretary to the BAC and the Chief Internal Auditor (CIA) were in attendance during the meetings. The President/CEO and other officers were invited to the meetings to deliberate on matters within their purview.

The governance practices are further strengthened as the BAC adheres to the provision of Paragraph 15.09 (1) (c) of MMLR, which requires of at least one (1) member of the Audit Committee must be a member of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants (MIA). Two (2) members of the BAC, Dato' Merina binti Abu Tahir and Ong Ai Lin, are members of the MIA.

The BAC Chairman submits report on proceedings of the BAC meetings to the Board for information and attention. Matters reserved for the Board's approval are tabled at TNB's Board meetings. Action sheets are issued by the Company Secretary on the decisions made and actions required. These are circulated to Management and relevant parties for their actions.

# Communication

The BRC continues to cascade its tone from the top, and particularly in the year under review, through the first in-person Top Management Risk Forum held since the pandemic. The BRC not only set the tone on the importance of effective risk management but also dialogued with 102 members of top and senior management in navigating a challenging risk landscape. The BRC successfully launched the TNB risk slogan, "RISK - First In Mind", during the forum and the slogan has been further cascaded to all levels of employees through various communication platforms.

# Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control

The BRC jointly reviewed and endorsed the Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control with the BAC. Subsequently, the Board approved it for inclusion in the TNB Integrated Annual Report. This statement outlines the Group's implemented risk management practices and internal controls. Additionally, it includes assurance from the President/CEO and Chief Financial Officer to the Board, confirming that the Group's risk management and internal control system are operating adequately and effectively in all material aspects.

# (II) BSRC

From 25 August 2023 onward, the BSRC continued to exercise the oversight by the Board of Directors on the effective governance and implementation of risk and in addition placed further emphasis on sustainability initiatives, as follows:

Additionally, the BSRC also deliberated on the governance and structured monitoring of the TNB Sustainability Pathway and ET Plan that was reformed in FY2022 through the introduction of the Sustainability and Energy Transition Council (SETC). This council aims to coordinate and oversee the TNB ET Plan, providing a platform for discussing the sustainability agenda, strategy development, implementation and value delivery of ET initiatives and climate-related matters. In the year under review, BSRC also approved revisions to the ESG related Key Risk Indicator (KRI) and its status was tabled quarterly through the TNB Risk Dashboard Report.

# TNB Sustainability Statement

The BSRC deliberated on the approach and plan for compliance, assurance, reporting of the TNB Sustainability Statement and the TNB Materiality Matrix, which forms part of the TNB Integrated Annual Report. The TNB Sustainability Statement is prepared in alignment with Bursa requirements and is guided by the Bursa Sustainability Reporting Guide (3rd Edition).

# CONCLUSION

The BSRC continues to exercise its oversight over the implementation of risk management initiatives for the achievement of business objectives. In addition, BSRC will have greater oversight over the implementation of the sustainability framework and the deployment of initiatives that are supported by specific indicators measuring performance against sustainability goals and targets.

The Group Internal Audit Department (GIA) of TNB is established by the Board to provide independent, objective assurance and consulting services designed to add value and improve TNB's operations. GIA assists TNB in accomplishing its business objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of governance, risk management and control processes.

GIA reports directly to the BAC to preserve its independence and objectivity, and administratively to President/CEO to enable the required stature to fulfil its responsibilities.

GIA is headed by the Chief Internal Auditor (CIA), Lizah Abd Wahab since 1 April 2021. With more than 20 years of experience in internal auditing, she brings a wealth of expertise to steer the team with proficiency and direction. She holds a Bachelor of Accounting and Finance degree from Manchester Metropolitan University, United Kingdom and a Master of Business Administration from Universiti Tenaga Nasional and Graduate Certificate in Management from the University of Melbourne. Additionally, she is a Certified Internal Auditor and obtained a Certification of Risk Management Assurance from Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA).

# APPROACHES AND FRAMEWORK

GIA strives to protect and enhance organisational value by providing risk-based and objective assurance, advice and insight through innovative solutions. The Internal Audit Charter, approved by the BAC, delineates GIA's responsibilities, authority, and scope of internal audit activities. The Charter is reviewed annually to ensure continued relevance to its intended purpose.

The processes and activities of GIA are governed by the standards and principles outlined in the International Professional Practices Framework (IPPF) issued by IIA, which comprises Core Principles for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing, Code of Ethics, International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing, and Definition of Internal Auditing. GIA undergoes an external evaluation of its effectiveness and quality at least once every three (3) years, and the result of the review is subsequently reported to the BAC.

GIA is guided by the Internal Control Framework of Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT) in assessing and reporting the adequacy and effectiveness of the design and implementation of the organisation's overall system of internal control, risk management and governance.

# SCOPE AND COVERAGE

GIA persistently develops the annual audit plan through a risk-based approach, considering factors such as TNB's risk profile, strategic objectives, regulatory requirements as well as inputs from BAC and senior management.

In FY2023, GIA produced a total of 143 reports arising from planned audits (comprising thematic and non-thematic audits), ad-hoc audit, and follow-up audits. Audit findings were presented to the BAC for deliberation and where relevant, BAC requested Management to rectify the weaknesses based on recommendations provided by GIA. GIA oversees the execution of corrective actions using the Audit Management System and reports the status to BAC and Management on a quarterly basis.

GIA has classified the areas of review into six (6) audit hotspots, aligning with current trends, shifts in risk landscape, and the dynamic roles of internal auditors. During FY2023, some of the focal areas reviewed encompassed:

# RELATIONSHIP WITH EXTERNAL AUDITORS

The Board maintains an open and professional association with External Auditors, and the BAC is entrusted with recommending their appointment or removal, approving their remuneration, and establishing the terms of engagement for Board approval.

Responsibilities of the Board and BAC include reviewing, assessing, and monitoring the performance, suitability, and independence of External Auditors. A comprehensive policy outlines guidelines and procedures for the assessment and monitoring processes, covering aspects such as Selection and Appointment, Independence, Conflict of Interest, Non-Audit Services, Rotation of Audit Partner, Annual Reporting, Annual Assessment and Audit Fees.

The appointed Audit Partner undergoes rotation at least every five (5) Financial Years, with a mandated two (2) year gap before returning as the Audit Partner for the engagement. While External Auditors may be engaged for non-audit services, their objectivity, judgment and independence must not be impaired. Written assurance of meeting independence requirements is obligatory for each non-audit service undertaken for the TNB Group.

Three (3) fundamental principles govern the prohibition of non-audit services: External Auditors cannot function in a management role, audit their own work, or serve in an advocacy role for TNB Group. Compliance with the By-Laws of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants (MIA) concerning non-audit services is mandatory, with the application of safeguards if necessary.

TNB External Auditors Policy stipulates a three (3)-year cooling-off period for a former partner of TNB's External Auditors before being appointed as a BAC member in accordance with Practice 9.2 of the MCCG. Additionally, in alignment with Guidance 9.3 of the MCCG, the annual assessment of External Auditors incorporates information from the Annual Transparency Report of the audit firm.

# INTEGRITY IN CORPORATE REPORTING AND

# MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP WITH STAKEHOLDERS

The BAC, in evaluating the External Auditors' independence, considers non-audit fees provided for services during the Financial Year. The conclusion is that these fees do not compromise or impair the independence or objectivity of the External Auditors.

The amount of Audit and Non-Audit Fees paid or payable to PwC or its affiliates by the Company and TNB Group for the Financial Year ended 31 December 2023 is as follows:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Group RM million</td><td>Company RM million</td></tr><tr><td>Statutory Audit</td><td>10.3</td><td>1.6</td></tr><tr><td>Audit Related Services</td><td>1.9</td><td>1.3</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>12.2</td><td>2.9</td></tr><tr><td>Non-Audit Services:</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>- Tax Related Services</td><td>0.2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>- Other Non-Audit Services</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>0.2</td><td>0</td></tr></table>

The Non-Audit Fees did not exceed  $50\%$  of the Audit Fees for the Financial Year under review, in line with TNB's External Auditors Policy.

All services were procured competitively in accordance with TNB's Procurement & Supply Chain Policy and Procedures and External Auditors Policy. Non-audit services can be offered by the External Auditors of the Group if there are clear efficiencies and value added benefits to the Group.

Based on the External Auditors Assessment Results for the Financial Year 2023, overall, the Company was completely satisfied/satisfied, with a score of  $97\%$ , showing an increase of  $3.7\%$  compared to the previous Financial Year, with the services provided by PwC in term of quality, sufficiency of resources, communication and interaction and independence, objectivity and professional skepticism. All comments made were forwarded to PwC in order to further improve their services.

With that, the Board/BAC are satisfied with the quality of service, sufficiency of resources, communication and interaction and independence, objectivity and professional skepticism demonstrated by PwC in carrying out its duties as External Auditors.

Being satisfied with the External Auditors' performance, the Board recommends their re-appointment for shareholders' approval at the AGM.

# INSIDER TRADING

Directors and Top Management at TNB must not deal in the securities of the Company or of other listed issuers as long as he/she is in possession of price-sensitive information relating to such listed securities. This adherence is in line with the MMLR and pertinent provisions of the Capital Markets & Services Act 2007. Notices delineating closed periods for trading in TNB's securities are disseminated on a quarterly basis, well in advance of each closed period. The Company Secretary shall make appropriate announcement upon receiving any notices of dealing in securities in line with Paragraph 14.08 and 14.09 of the MMLR respectively.

# RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT IN RESPECT OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR UNDER REVIEW

The Board holds full responsibility for ensuring the preparation of Audited Financial Statements aligns with the Companies Act 2016 and the approved accounting standards set forth by the Malaysian Accounting Standards Board. This commitment is aimed at presenting an accurate portrayal of the Group's state of affairs, profit or loss and cash flow at the close of the accounting period. In the preparation of these financial statements, the Directors confirm compliance with applicable approved accounting standards in Malaysia, exercising reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates. Furthermore, the Audited Financial Statements are prepared on a going concern basis, as the Board, upon thorough inquiry, reasonably expects the Group to possess adequate resources for its operational continuity in the foreseeable future.

# STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL

The Board of Directors (the Board) is pleased to present its Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control (SORMIC) for the financial year ended 31 December 2023. This statement, collaboratively developed and jointly endorsed by the Board Sustainability and Risk Committee (BSRC), formerly known as the Board Risk Committee (BRC), and the Board Audit Committee (BAC), adheres to the stipulations set forth in paragraph 15.26(b) of the Main Market Listing Requirements of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad (Bursa). Additionally, it is guided by the Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control - Guidelines for Directors of Listed Issuers issued by Bursa.

The SORMIC delineates the nature and breadth of the risk management and internal control systems in TNB Group, including subsidiaries, throughout the reviewed fiscal year. It provides an overview of the framework, policy, process and measures adopted to mitigate risks and uphold operational integrity within TNB Group. Notably, this disclosure excludes associated companies and joint ventures.

The Board persistently upholds its overarching responsibility and remains dedicated to the establishment and continual upkeep of robust, efficient, and effective risk management and internal control systems. This commitment serves to safeguard shareholders' investments and the assets held by the Group. These systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate risks and therefore provide reasonable rather than absolute assurance against material losses, misstatements, or other significantly adverse consequences.

# Note:

* BRC changed to BSRC on 25 August 2023.

Since its establishment on June 5, 2013, the Board Risk Committee (BRC) reaffirms the Board's commitment to ensure that the Group has in place a robust risk management framework and that such framework has been effectively implemented to enhance the Group's ability to achieve its strategic objectives.

The BRC is supported by the Management, primarily through the Group Executive Management Committee chaired by the President/CEO. It is complemented by the cross-functional GRMWC and Subsidiaries Risk Management Working Committee (SRMWC).

The Risk Management Department (RMD) helmed by the Chief Risk Officer facilitates the implementation of the TNB Risk Management Framework.

Recognising the importance of sustainability in our business, the BRC Terms of Reference was reviewed, which led to the transformation of the BRC to the Board Sustainability and Risk Committee (BSRC), effective from 25 August 2023. Consequent to changes in the organisational structure in the fiscal year, the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) reports to the Chief Sustainability Officer with RMD being one of the departments in the newly formed Sustainability Division effective from 1 June 2023.

Throughout the fiscal year, the BRC/BSRC upheld its commitment to diligent oversight, convening nine (9) meetings to address various risks and opportunities associated with investment proposals, strategic initiatives, and operational dynamics. These meetings also encompassed a thorough review of TNB business entities' operational risk profiles and in-depth deliberations on KRI. Moreover, the BRC/BSRC also endorsed the SORMIC FY2022 and TNB Materiality Matrix FY2023, and approved the revised TNB Risk Dashboard FY2023, TNB Strategic Risks and the updated TNB Investment Risk Methodology. Business entities provided assurances to the BRC/BSRC regarding their risk management and internal controls, thus assisting the Board in its decision-making, particularly in managing potential risks and harnessing opportunities.

# STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL

# Risk Assessment Process

TNB business entities are guided by the TNB Risk Assessment Process that provides a structured approach to identify, analyse, evaluate and treat risks. TNB business entities apply the process in a systematic, iterative and collaborative manner, drawing on the knowledge and views of stakeholders to develop and review their respective risk profiles.

The TNB Risk Assessment Process was applied in the assessment of the TNB Strategic Risks based on the Reimagining TNB (RT) strategy and in consideration of internal and external factors. Below are the 12TNB Strategic Risks approved by the BRC/BSRC in the year under review:

<table><tr><td>Category</td><td>No.</td><td>TNB Strategic Risk</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">External</td><td rowspan="2">1.</td><td>Catastrophic disruptions from external factors</td></tr><tr><td>TNB faces the potential threat of unpredictable external events, which possess the capacity to significantly disrupt our business operations, profitability, and/or reputation. These events encompass various external factors, including but not limited to pandemics, cybersecurity attacks, economic collapses, and geopolitical risks. Although these occurrences have a low probability of transpiring, their unpredictability renders them capable of inflicting catastrophic impacts on our business operations.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Sustainability</td><td rowspan="2">2.</td><td>Inability to keep pace with Environment, Social &amp; Governance (ESG) developments and transitions globally</td></tr><tr><td>Corporations worldwide face increase risks in transitioning to a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy. It is vital that we align to global ESG commitments and frameworks given TNB's role as Malaysia's primary power utility. Failure to do so will impede our business growth in addition to eroding market confidence in TNB to be a utility that is able to provide sustainable energy solutions. This will adversely impact investors' confidence, stakeholder's trust and company reputation.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="6">Regulatory</td><td rowspan="2">3.</td><td>Unfavourable energy transition &amp; climate change policies &amp; regulations</td></tr><tr><td>Energy Transition regulatory risks pose significant challenges for power utilities. The shift towards renewable energy sources and decarbonisation initiatives may require costly infrastructure upgrades and technology investments. Evolving regulations can impact revenue streams and profitability, especially if incentives or subsidies change. Stricter emissions standards might necessitate the retirement of existing assets or impose penalties for non-compliance. Additionally, uncertainties in policy direction may hinder long-term planning and investments. Failure to address these risks adequately can undermine TNB's competitiveness and financial stability.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">4.</td><td>Unfavourable Electricity Supply Industry (ESI) regulatory implementation and outcome</td></tr><tr><td>Globally, the electricity supply industry is highly regulated. Government regulations and policies control various aspects, including approving generation capacity and mix, setting limits for investment and operation costs of electricity networks, and determining electricity prices. Uncertainty surrounding future regulations may hinder long-term planning and investment decisions whilst non-compliance with regulations can result in penalties and reputational damage. Inability to shape and manage the outcome of these regulation and policies governing the Malaysian ESI would be key impediment impacting TNB ability to deliver its business aspiration.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">5.</td><td>Regulatory Uncertainty</td></tr><tr><td>Due to the nature of our business, we are susceptible to the decisions by regulatory stakeholders at the federal, state and international levels. Business operations may be delayed or encumbered due to measures and decisions in relation to investment and divestment, use of natural resources and right-of-way.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Market</td><td rowspan="2">6.</td><td>Unable to be competitive in non-regulated business (international &amp; domestic)</td></tr><tr><td>Growing TNB's non-regulated business is a key strategy of TNB's future growth plans. Inability to be competitive would result in difficulty to attract new customers and potential partners leading to stagnant or decline in market share and potential revenue. Inadequate competitiveness may result in lower operational efficiencies and higher costs that may hamper our ability to access capital while reducing the overall returns.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Customer</td><td rowspan="2">7.</td><td>Inability to remain as the electricity provider of choice by customers</td></tr><tr><td>TNB supplies electricity to the entire nation, and we need to continue doing it reliably, safely and at a high quality to retain the trust and confidence of the people. At the same time, we need to continue growing TNB's brand and reputation. Failure to do so may cause customer dissatisfaction and impact our sales, EBIT and reputation.</td></tr><tr><td>Finance</td><td>8.</td><td>Ineffective capital allocation to maximise value creation
Management makes decisions on how to source and allocate funds effectively to maximise potential return. Failure to do so would dire implications to TNB, including missed opportunities, reduced financial profits and market confidence.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Capabilities</td><td>9.</td><td>Gaps in workforce capabilities to deliver RT strategy and sustainability aspiration
It is critical for TNB to focus on developing and deploying new institutional capabilities to the right areas. We also need to enhance workforce diversity in terms of skill sets and exposures that are in line with our aspiration to diversify internationally.
Failure to close the capabilities gap would impact TNB's ability to achieve its RT strategy.</td></tr><tr><td>10.</td><td>Failure to ingrain TNB culture in employees' behaviour in supporting Reimagining TNB strategy and sustainability aspiration
Culture molds the direction, beliefs and shared values that shapes employee (at all levels including the Board)'s perceptions, behaviours and understanding. Failure to ingrain the Reimagining Culture values in the organisation and processes may result in lower productivity, fraud and bribery or silo mentality.</td></tr><tr><td>Physical Asset Risk</td><td>11.</td><td>Failure to mitigate physical risks caused by climate change
Physical climate change risks pose significant challenges to TNB in the form of extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and changing precipitation patterns that can damage infrastructure, disrupt operations and impact power generation, transmission and distribution. Failure to manage these risks can result in prolonged outages, increased operation and repair costs, regulatory penalties, reputational damage and impede long-term business sustainability.</td></tr><tr><td>Supply Chain</td><td>12.</td><td>Disruptions to supply chain
TNB's ability to ensure the security of supply depends on undisrupted procurement and distribution of resources needed to operate all its infrastructure. Delays or disruption resulting from supplier failure, transportation issues and geopolitical interventions may lead to delays in project delivery, prolonged electricity supply outages and increased costs.</td></tr></table>

# Review, Monitor and Report

The BRC/BSRC approved the TNB 3-Year Cycle Risk Governance Plan for implementation from FY2022 to FY2024. This plan is implemented by the RMD to assist the BRC/BSRC in meeting its terms of reference. The plan outlines three (3) risk governance activities, which are risk review, risk maturity assessment and desktop risk assessment. According to plan, RMD in collaboration with TNB business entities, conducted 15 risk reviews, five (5) risk maturity assessments and eight (8) desktop risk assessments in the year under review.

As per the TNB Risk Management Framework, TNB business entities are responsible to assess respective risks and register into the TNB Risk Information System (TRIS), a centralised online real-time tool and database, for monitoring and reporting. Risks are also reviewed annually by the business entities with participation and eventual approval from the risk owners.

Half-year risk reports are submitted by business entities to RMD for consolidation. Group-wide consolidated half-year risk reports, which include reports of emerging risks, are deliberated and endorsed by the GRMWC for onward internal dissemination.

# Key Risk Indicators

Business entities have diligently identified relevant Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) that serve as early warning of increasing risk exposures and potential risk

events. These KRIs are developed in consideration of the risk appetite of the BRC/BSRC and Management. The status of KRIs is reported quarterly to the BRC/BSRC, GRMWC and SRMWC with mitigating measures extensively deliberated to address risk exposures from escalating beyond tolerable levels.

The BRC/BSRC monitors KRIs impacting five (5) key areas, which are operations, financial standing, regulatory, reputation and international investment. Operational-level KRIs are deliberated by the GRMWC and SRMWC that are platforms for inter-business collaboration to mitigate risks from a group-wide perspective.

Annually, these KRs undergo review to ensure relevance and adequacy, aligning with short- and long-term business objectives while considering changes in internal and external environments.

# Communication & Integration

TNB business entities consistently engage in communication with both internal and external stakeholders, providing current and comprehensive risk information. Timely feedback is gathered and integrated to foster continual enhancement. Integral to their role is the seamless integration of risk management within their objectives, governance, leadership commitment, operations, and performance management. This holistic approach ensures that risk management becomes an inherent part of the operational fabric, enhancing the overall resilience and adaptability of the Group.

# STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL

The BRC/BSRC continues to cascade its tone from the top, and particularly in the fiscal year, through the first in-person Top Management Risk Forum held since the pandemic. The BRC/BSRC not only set the tone on the importance of effective risk management but also dialogued with 102 members of top and senior management in navigating a challenging risk landscape. Market experts such as the Head of Carbon Market, Bursa Malaysia, were invited to share insights on risk and opportunities related to the power utility industry. The TNB risk slogan, "RISK - First In Mind", was launched by the BRC/BSRC during the forum and was further cascaded to all levels of employees through various communication platforms.

RMD actively promotes a culture of risk awareness throughout TNB in the year under review, organising five (5) highly successful face to face internal risk conferences, bringing together 383 TNB executives and non-executives. These risk communication efforts were held to encourage active participation across all levels with emphasis on the importance and benefits of integrating risk management into daily operations and decision-making processes. The strong support, including the commitment from TNB Management in holding dialogues with the employees during these conferences, reflects the shared responsibility for effective risk management by all employees in order to successfully navigate current and future challenges.

Additionally, RMD in collaboration with TNB Integrated Learning Solution Sdn. Bhd. (ILSAS), the centre for energy learning, advisory, services and consultancy, continue to drive risk management training modules at fundamental and intermediate levels. In the year under review, a total of 116 TNB employees completed the fundamentals module and 119 employees completed the intermediate module.

During the fiscal year, the first TNB Risk Management E-Learning Module was launched and incorporated as part of the learning journey of all TNB executives, whereby each TNB executive shall complete the online module every two (2) years. The purpose of the e-learning module is to inculcate a risk thinking mindset and strengthen informed decision-making among TNB executives. The e-learning module is continually reviewed taking into account changes in the TNB Risk Management Framework and its implementation.

# Culture

The risk culture delineated within the TNB Risk Management Framework harmonises seamlessly with the six (6) TNB core values and corresponding behaviors. The application of these core values and behaviours serves as a beacon, offering clear guidance and communicates the expected behaviour of employees. This alignment fortifies a cohesive understanding, establishing a framework for fostering and perpetuating a resilient and enduring risk culture essential for TNB's sustainable growth and resilience.

# INTERNAL CONTROL

# Group Policies and Procedures

The Board and Management have approved group-wide policies and procedures, embedding ethics and internal control principles and mechanisms within business operations. Regular review processes ensure the ongoing relevance and effectiveness of these policies and procedures.

Among others, the Group policies and procedures in place are:

<table><tr><td>TNB Code of Business Ethics</td><td>TNB Environmental Policy</td></tr><tr><td>TNB Ethics &amp; Integrity Policy</td><td>TNB Security Policy</td></tr><tr><td>TNB Risk Management Policy</td><td>TNB Communication Policy</td></tr><tr><td>TNB Confidentiality Policy</td><td>TNB Personal Data Protection Policy</td></tr><tr><td>TNB Asset Management Policy</td><td>TNB Disciplinary Procedures</td></tr><tr><td>TNB Limits of Authority</td><td rowspan="2">TNB Investment Process Control: Updated Investment Process and Investment Risk Methodology</td></tr><tr><td>TNB Procurement and Supply Chain Policy and Procedures</td></tr><tr><td>TNB ICT Security Policy and ICT Codes of Practice</td><td>TNB Group Financial Policies and Procedures</td></tr><tr><td>TNB Safety &amp; Health Policy</td><td>TNB Group Human Resource circulars and guidelines</td></tr></table>

# STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT

# AND INTERNAL CONTROL

# Financial and Operational Control Framework

The TNB Group Financial Policies and Procedures (GFPP) stand as an imperative point of reference guiding the Group's financial and operational conduct. The Group has acted in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and the Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards. Regular evaluations comparing actual performance against established budgets, targets, and historical benchmarks for key functions and strategic initiatives are carried out. Necessary mitigating measures and follow-up actions are promptly implemented.

The Board Audit Committee (BAC) reviews the Group's quarterly financial performance together with Management and these are subsequently reported to the Board. The quarterly reviews enable the BAC to deliberate and assess the Group's financial results and operational performance.

TNB continues to proactively engage with relevant stakeholders for smooth implementation of the Incentive-Based Regulations (IBR) framework. The performance of the regulated business is meticulously monitored through the IBR performance indicators and dashboards. These are reported regularly to relevant decision-making committees to ensure effective implementation of the IBR framework as well as to the Energy Commission in compliance with the IBR guidelines.

The procedures for critical functions and key activities are documented, communicated to employees and periodically reviewed. Relevant business entities have been consistently maintaining its certification in ISO 9001, ISO 14001, ISO 27001, ISO 37001, ISO 45001 and ISO 55001. Internal audits are conducted to ensure compliance with relevant standards and procedures.

# Strategic Planning and Performance Management Cycle

A holistic strategic planning process is integral in providing focus and alignment between aspiration, strategies, performance management and the desired strategic outcomes. The Strategic Planning and Performance Management (SPPM) cycle approved by the Board depicts a 5-part cycle that integrates the capital and budget allocation process with the performance management cycle. It includes the identification of strategy driven Key Performance Indicators (KPI) based on long-term business plans and annual operating plans, which are thereafter cascaded to all levels of employees. The strategy driven KPI methodology is derived from the Balanced Scorecard concept that focuses on performance measures from four (4) perspectives, which are financial, customer, internal process and learning and growth.

# Human Resource Management and Development

The TNB Ways of Working (TwoW) that promotes flexible working arrangements has been implemented across the Group in the year under review. This strategic decision seamlessly aligns with the amendments

to the Employment (Amendment) Act 2022, particularly in embracing and enacting flexible working arrangements. This way of working aims to inspire and add value to employees, create an agile workforce and foster a culture of wholehearted dedication, underpinned by three (3) fundamental principles of trust, empowerment, and mindfulness.

Job descriptions and responsibilities of approved positions are clearly defined and communicated through the internal online platform, People Matters Better Brighter. Workforce requirement planning is carried out and led by the Group Human Resource, mirroring the budget planning cycle with the aim of optimising staffing levels and increasing productivity. Employee training needs are regularly assessed and various programmes are in place to address competency gaps.

Moreover, effective succession management improves organisational ability to maintain continuity of operations with minimal disruption and benefits both the employees by preparing them to be strong talents and the organisation by facilitating smooth transitions. The TNB Succession Management Framework aims to ensure the succession management strategy is agile and in line with current and projected business objectives by defining critical positions, nominating and evaluating talents, identifying development needs, and reviewing and adapting to business needs.

# Healthcare & Wellness Management

TNB is committed towards elevating the standard of healthcare for its employees, retirees, and dependents. A key initiative introduced in the year under review is the Medication Delivery Services (MDS) to facilitate seamless procurement and delivery of long-term or chronic medications through three (3) Klinik TNB. In addition, 1,276 panel hospitals and clinics are available nationwide for widespread accessibility to essential medical treatment and healthcare.

The TNB Total Wellness Programme is aimed at educating and influencing employees towards a healthy lifestyle and work life balance continues to be implemented through the "Vibrant Living - Healthier. Together" initiative. This initiative focuses on six (6) scope, which are healthy diet, no smoking/vaping, active lifestyle, weight management, basic health screening and mental well-being. Weekly "Wellness Wednesday" health talks and awareness sessions conducted online are open to all employees and retirees with the aim of increasing awareness on common health issues and encouraging healthier habits.

# TNB Digital Strategy

TNB has undertaken significant digitalisation endeavours to embrace digital transformation as a key enabler of the RT strategy. These initiatives encompass data analytics, robotic process automation, and development of a visionary Network of the Future. TNB remains steadfast in advancing digital transformation aligned to national and organisational aspiration.

# STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL

# Management Information Systems

Leveraging on information and communication technology is vital in promoting effective and efficient business operations as well as timely and accurate communication with internal and external stakeholders. Examples of key information systems utilised by the Group for that purpose are:

Enterprise Resource Management System (ERMS)

Enterprise Human Resources Management System (EHRMS)

Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System (SCADA)

TNB Outage Management Systems (TOMS)

Billing Customer Relationship Management (BCRM)

Employee Self Service (ESS)

Super User Privilege Management and Governance, Risk and Compliance systems have been implemented to control and govern access to core systems and servers. This is to ensure that access to critical information systems and confidential information is adequately monitored and controlled. Annual disaster recovery tests are carried out at the data centres and ICT security assessments are regularly carried out on systems at the business entities. In addition, various enhancements are implemented to strengthen cyber security for Information Technology and Operational Technology systems. In the event of system failure, various mitigations are in place to minimise disruption to operations.

# Personal Data Protection

TNB is committed to safeguard data subjects' personal data in accordance with the Personal Data Protection Act 2010 (PDPA). TNB was an active contributor to the development of The Personal Data Protection Code of Practice for The Utilities Sector (Electricity) Version 2.0 (Code of Practice), which serves as a guideline for the processing and handling of data subjects' personal data. As data privacy is vital, the Legal Services Department is committed to consistently educate and communicate the requirements of the PDPA and the Code of Practice across TNB to enhance awareness and compliance to the PDPA.

# TNB Corporate Integrity Management System

The TNB Corporate Integrity Management System (TCIMS) is in place to improve the integrity culture in the Group, reduce the impact of corruption or mismanagement and position TNB at par internationally through a strategic and structured integrity management system. TNB is certified with ISO 37001:2016 Anti-Bribery Management Systems since 2018 and has put in place a management system designed to help prevent, detect and respond to bribery and comply with anti-bribery laws and voluntary commitments applicable to its activities. Annually, TNB employees complete the Integrity Pledge and Conflict of Interest declarations via the Employee Self Service system and the Integrity E-learning module via the People Matters Better Brighter system. The integrity e-learning module is also extended to the vendors and suppliers.

The Integrity Department designs and implements a comprehensive training and communication plan comprising of initiatives and programs to address gaps identified in the annual Integrity Health Index (IHI) survey. Highlights of the training and communication initiatives implemented in the fiscal year include a seminar for the Board and Management titled "The Law Behind Corporate Governance" conducted by the Malaysia Institute of Corporate Governance (MICG) and engagements and training sessions with the unions, employees and vendors on anti-bribery, corruption and corporate liability. These efforts align with the requirements outlined in the TRUST elements under Section 17A of the MACC Act 2009.

Additionally, the Whistle Blowing Information System (WBIS) underwent enhancements in the year under review to strengthen the management of integrity governance data for reporting to the Board Integrity Committee and in compliance to mandatory reporting requirements by MACC.

# Tenaga Safety Culture

The Tenaga Safety Culture Programme aims to inculcate safety as part of the everyday working culture, transforming it from a mere compliance activity. It is based on four core behaviours, which are 'Assess', 'Comply', 'Intervene' and 'Actively Caring'. Various initiatives have been implemented such as the TNB Life Saving Rules (LSR) that has been in effect since 2017. These rules are intended to preserve the lives of employees and contractors, and mitigate the risk of serious injuries within the work environment. The LSR implementation includes consequence management as part of our internal controls.

# STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT

# AND INTERNAL CONTROL

The Stop Work Intervention guideline was established in the year under review to empower employees and contractors to assume responsibility for their safety and the safety of their peers. Any individual is authorised to activate a stop work intervention upon encountering unsafe conditions or observing unsafe acts within the workplace. In addition, the NIOSH Tenaga Safety Leader Passport (NTSLP) certification, which is implemented across the Group for all employees, has been extended and enforced in the fiscal year for contractor supervisors. This aims to address the primary cause of past contractor accidents due to inadequate supervision. NIOSH had acknowledged the strategic partnership of this program, further validating its importance and impact.

# Customer Experience

With attention to customer centricity, a variety of channels, utilising the "Click, Call, Come Over," platform, is made available to customers. The platform covers a wide range of touch points that enable quality solutions, services and continuous interaction options to enhance customer experience. A systematic approach is in place for timely resolution of feedback such as service requests, complaints, comments, enquiries and concerns. In addition, the myTNB web portal and mobile application are available to customers to manage their electricity account(s) in one location. myTNB allows customers to make express payment of electricity bills without needing to log in.

# Business Continuity Management

The TNB Business Continuity Management (BCM) Framework was developed in alignment with ISO 22301:2019 'Security and Resilience - Business Continuity Management Systems'. The framework provides a structured approach in managing business continuity in the Group that enables prompt, coordinated and effective response to a crisis and maintain continuity of essential activities as well as protecting human life, assets, reputation and the environment. The framework is the focal point of reference for TNB business entities to formulate and implement business continuity strategies tailored to respective business objectives and critical functions.

The robustness of the TNB Corporate Crisis Command Structure, of which the President/CEO and TNB Management are members, is tested annually through planned drills and is activated to manage potential or declared crises in accordance with the Corporate TNB BCM document. Improvements identified in post-mortems are implemented to enhance capabilities, preparedness and resiliency. Additionally, drills of various scenarios are collaboratively conducted by TNB business entities to enhance coordination and effective response. In the year under review, specific business continuity plans were developed and tested to ensure available and reliable electricity supply throughout the period of the Malaysian state elections at Selangor, Kelantan, Terengganu, Negeri Sembilan, Kedah, and Penang following the dissolution of respective state assemblies.

To further strengthen prompt and coordinated response during crises that affect the nation, strategic engagements were carried out with relevant government agencies such as the National Disaster Management Agency (NADMA) via courtesy visits and joint drills. Notable outcomes in the fiscal year are the successful desktop drills conducted in collaboration with NADMA based on a dam safety scenario and with the Majlis Keselamatan Negara (MKN) based on a security threat scenario to critical national infrastructures in power utility, telecommunications, and oil and gas.

# CONCLUSION

The Board has obtained assurances from the President/CEO and Chief Financial Officer that the Group's risk management and internal control system is operating adequately and effectively, in all material aspects. Where areas of improvement have been identified, rectification steps have been taken for enhancement.

The Board is of the view that the risk management and internal control system in place for the year under review and up to the date of approval of this statement for inclusion into the annual report, is adequate and effective to safeguard shareholders' investment, the interests of customers, regulators and employees, and the Group's assets.

# DIRECTORS' REPORT

(b) At the date of this report, the Directors are not aware of any circumstances:

(i) which would render the amount written off for bad debts or the amount of the provision for doubtful debts inadequate to any substantial extent; or  
(ii) which would render the values attributed to current assets in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company misleading; or  
(iii) which have arisen and would render adherence to the existing method of valuation of assets or liabilities of the Group and of the Company misleading or inappropriate.

(c) At the date of this report:

(i) there are no charges on the assets of the Group and of the Company which have arisen since the end of the financial year which secures the liabilities of any other person; and

(d) No contingent or other liability of any company in the Group has become enforceable or is likely to become enforceable within the period of twelve months after the end of the financial year which, in the opinion of the Directors, will or may affect the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to meet their obligations when they fall due.

(e) At the date of this report, the Directors are not aware of any circumstances not otherwise dealt with in this report or the financial statements of the Group and of the Company which would render any amount stated in the respective financial statements misleading.

(i) the results of the operations of the Group and of the Company during the financial year were not substantially affected by any item, transaction or event of a material and unusual nature; and

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

31 December 2023

# 1 GENERAL INFORMATION

The Group and the Company are primarily involved in the business of the generation, transmission, distribution and sales of electricity and those tabulated in Note 49 to these financial statements, which also includes the details of the subsidiaries of the Group.

There have been no significant changes in these activities of the Group and of the Company during the financial year.

The Group and the Company follow the Incentive Based Regulation ('IBR') framework for the regulated business.

The Company is a public limited liability company, incorporated and domiciled in Malaysia and is listed on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad.

The address of the registered office of the Company is Pejabat Setiausaha Syarikat, Tenaga Nasional Berhad ('TNB'), Tingkat 16, Tower A, TNB Platinum, No. 3, Jalan Bukit Pantai, Bangsar, 59100 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

The financial statements of the Group and the Company have been approved for issuance in accordance with a resolution of Board of Directors on 19 March 2024.

# 2 BASIS OF PREPARATION

The financial statements of the Group and of the Company have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards ('MFRS'), International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS') and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The Directors continue to consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except as disclosed in Note 3 and respective notes in the financial statements.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with MFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. It also requires Directors to exercise their judgement in the process of applying the Group's and the Company's accounting policies. Although these estimates and judgements are based on the Directors' best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may differ. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in Note 4.

(a) New standard and amendments to published standards that are effective and applicable to the Group and the Company.

Effective for financial year beginning on 1 January 2023:  

<table><tr><td>MFRS 17</td><td>Insurance Contracts</td></tr><tr><td>Amendments to MFRS 17 Insurance Contracts</td><td>Initial Application of MFRS 17 Insurance Contracts and MFRS 9 Financial Instruments - Comparative Information</td></tr><tr><td>Amendments to MFRS 101 Presentation of Financial Statements and MFRS Practice Statement 2 Making Materiality Judgements</td><td>Disclosure of Accounting Policies</td></tr><tr><td>Amendments to MFRS 108 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors</td><td>Definition of Accounting Estimates</td></tr><tr><td>Amendments to MFRS 112 Income Taxes</td><td>Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction</td></tr><tr><td>Amendments to MFRS 112 Income Taxes</td><td>International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules</td></tr></table>

The amendments to the published standards listed above did not have any significant impact on the amounts recognised in prior periods and are not expected to significantly affect the current or future periods, other than as disclosed below.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

31 December 2023

# 2 BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED)

(a) New standard and amendments to published standards that are effective and applicable to the Group and the Company. (continued)

Adoption and amendments to MFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts

The adoption of MFRS 17 Insurance Contracts and its related amendments has resulted in changes in accounting policies, shifting from recognising insurance profits upon premium receipt to acknowledging them as it fulfils insurance services. In addition, it requires disclosing anticipated future profits from insurance contract. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023 and it supersedes MFRS 4.

The Group and the Company completed the assessment of MFRS 17 and concluded that the impact from adoption of the standard is mainly contributed by TNB Global Captive (L) Ltd., which provides reinsurance services. The adoption of MFRS 17 does not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and hence the prior period financial statements were not restated. Adjustments related to the changes in accounting policies and other relevant disclosures under MFRS 17 are detailed in Notes 17, 21, 23 and 31 of the financial statements.

Amendments to MFRS 112 - Income Taxes

Amendments to MFRS 112 Income Taxes on International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules give entities temporary relief from recognising and disclosing accounting for deferred taxes arising from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's ('OECD') international tax reform and introduces targeted disclosure requirements to help investors better understand an entity's exposure to income taxes arising from the reform, particularly before legislation implementing the rules is in effect. The Group applied temporary exception for the year ended 31 December 2023.

The legislation will be effective for the Group's financial year beginning 1 January 2024 in certain jurisdictions. The Group is in the process of assessing the potential exposure arising from Pillar Two legislation and expects to complete the assessment in the financial year ending 2024.

(b) Amendments to the published standards that are applicable to the Group and the Company but not yet effective.

Effective for financial year beginning on 1 January 2024:

<table><tr><td>Amendments to MFRS 107 Cash Flow Statements and MFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures</td><td>Supplier Finance Arrangements</td></tr><tr><td>Amendments to MFRS 16 Leases</td><td>Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback</td></tr><tr><td>Amendments to MFRS 101 Presentation of Financial Statements</td><td>Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current and Non-current Liabilities with Covenants</td></tr></table>

Effective for financial year beginning on 1 January 2025:

<table><tr><td>Amendments to MFRS 121 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates</td><td>Lack of Exchangeability</td></tr></table>

Effective date deferred by Malaysian Accounting Standards Board:

<table><tr><td>Amendments to MFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and MFRS 128 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures</td><td>Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture</td></tr></table>

# 2 BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED)

(b) Amendments to the published standards that are applicable to the Group and the Company but not yet effective. (continued)

The amendments to published standards are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group and the Company.

There are no other standards, amendments and improvements to published standards and interpretations to existing standards that are not effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group and the Company.

# 3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The material accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below and within the respective notes to the financial statements line items.

(a) Subsidiaries and basis of consolidation

(i) Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when:

exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity;  
has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the relevant activities of the entity; and  
the existence and effect of potential voting rights are considered only when such rights are substantive when assessing control.

In the Company's separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses. On disposal of such investments, the difference between net disposal proceeds and their carrying amounts are included in the statement of profit or loss.

(ii) Basis of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. The characteristics of those financial statements are:

the financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting date as the Company.  
- subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.  
- intragroup balances, transactions and unrealised gains or losses are eliminated in full.  
uniform accounting policies are adopted in the consolidated financial statements for like transactions and events in similar circumstances.

The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement and fair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are, with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair value at the acquisition date.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

31 December 2023

# 3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

(a) Subsidiaries and basis of consolidation (continued)

(ii) Basis of consolidation (continued)

The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any NCI in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Group's share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If this is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the gain is recognised in the statement of profit or loss. Refer to Note 10 for accounting policy on goodwill.

NCI is the equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the Group measures any NCI in the acquiree either at fair value or at the NCI's proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. At the end of the reporting period, NCI consists of amount calculated on the date of combinations and its share of changes in the subsidiary's equity since the date of combination.

All earnings and losses of the subsidiary are attributed to the parent and the NCI, even if the attribution of losses to the NCI results in a debit balance in the shareholders' equity.

(iii) Changes in ownership interest

When the Group ceases to consolidate because of loss of control, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value with the change in carrying amount recognised in the statement of profit or loss. This fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in OCI in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in OCI are reclassified to statement of profit or loss. Gains or losses on the disposal of subsidiaries include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the subsidiaries sold.

(b) Transactions with NCI

Transactions with NCI that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as transactions with equity owners of the Group. A change in ownership interest results in an adjustment between the carrying amounts of the controlling and NCI to reflect their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any differences between the amount of the adjustment to NCI and any consideration paid or received are recognised in equity attributable to owners of the Group.

(c) Impairment of non-financial assets

Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment losses whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit or loss for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less cost to sell and its value in use ('VIU'). For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets (cash-generating units).

Non-financial assets other than goodwill previously impaired are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. Any subsequent increase in recoverable amount is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.

All other material accounting policies are disclosed in their respective notes.

# 4 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS

Estimates and judgements are continuously evaluated by the Directors and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

The Group and the Company make estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, rarely equate to the related actual results. To enhance the information content of the estimates, certain key variables that are anticipated to have a material impact on the Group's and the Company's results and financial positions are tested for sensitivity to changes in the underlying parameters.

The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are outlined below:

(a) Impairment of associates

The Group and the Company assess impairment of its investment in associates whenever the events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, i.e. the carrying amount is more than the recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is measured at the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and its VIU. The VIU is the net present value of the projected future cash flow derived from the investment discounted at an appropriate discount rate. Projected future cash flows are based on the Group's estimates calculated based on historical, sector and industry trends, general market and economic conditions, changes in technology and other available information. The assumptions used, results and sensitivity of the impairment assessments are disclosed in Note 9.

(b) Impairment of intangible assets

The Group tests intangible assets which includes goodwill for impairment annually in accordance with its accounting policy and whenever events or change in circumstances indicate that this is necessary within the financial period. This requires an estimation of the VIU of the cash generating unit ('CGU') to which the goodwill is allocated. Estimating the VIU requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the CGU to the Group and also to apply a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. The assumptions used, results and sensitivity of the impairment assessment of goodwill are disclosed in Note 10.

(c) Measurement of expected credit loss ('ECL') allowance for financial assets

The loss allowances for financial assets are based on assumptions about risk of default and expected loss rates. The Group and the Company use judgements in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the impairment calculation, based on the Group's and the Company's past history, existing market conditions as well as forward looking estimates at the end of each reporting period. Details of key assumptions and inputs used are disclosed in Note 45.

(d) Recognition of fair value adjustments and intangible assets arising from acquisitions

During the financial year, the Group acquired Spark Renewables Pty Ltd Group ('Spark Renewables'), Dullarbtons Limited ('Dullarbtons') and Elipsgeen Limited ('Elipsgeen'), and purchase price allocation exercises were undertaken which involved assumptions in determining the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The provisional goodwill arising from these acquisitions amounted to RM491.1 million. Details of the acquisition are set out in Note 48.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

31 December 2023

# 4 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS (CONTINUED)

The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are outlined below: (continued)

(e) Estimation of income taxes

(i) Income tax

Income tax is estimated based on the rules governed under the Income Tax Act, 1967.

Differences in determining the capital allowances, deductibility of certain expenses and subsequent utilisation of reinvestment allowance may arise during the estimation of the provision for income tax between tax calculated at the statement of financial position date, and the final submission to the tax authority as a result of obtaining further detailed information that may become available subsequent to the statement of financial position date.

Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recognised, such differences will impact the income tax provisions and deferred tax balance in the period in which such determination is made.

The Group and the Company have recorded tax recoverable for which the Group and the Company believe that it is probable to be recovered. Where the final tax outcome of this matter is different from the amount that was initially recorded, such difference may cause a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the tax recoverable balance recorded in the period in which such determination is made.

Reinvestment allowance ('RIA') litigation

The Company and the Inland Revenue Board ('IRB') have entered into various of litigation cases in respect of the Company's eligibility for RIA. The details of the cases are as disclosed in Note 42(a).

As at 31 December 2023, the Group and the Company recorded a tax recoverable of RM3,522.4 million from the IRB arising from:

- Resubmission of tax computations for the Years of Assessment ('YAs') 2003 to 2006 and 2008 to 2012 pursuant to the explicit approval given by the IRB on 21 January 2013 on the eligibility of the Company in claiming the RIA amounted to RM1,765.2 million; and  
The payment which had been made to IRB in December 2020 in respect of YAs 2016 and 2017 amounted to RM1,757.2 million which is disputed by IRB as detailed in Note 42(a).

The Group and the Company have not recorded the potential additional tax liability arising from the tax impact if the RIA claimed is disallowed and the Company loses its litigation. The realisation of this tax recoverable and the potential tax liability are dependent on the outcome of judgement on the RIA claims by the Special Commissioners of Income Tax ('SCIT') and by the Kuala Lumpur High Court, including the subsequent notice of appeal filed by IRB before the Court of Appeal.

The Directors have performed an assessment on the tax recoverable of RM3,522.4 million and the potential tax liability of RM6,101.4 million based on legal view obtained from external legal counsel and the facts surrounding its RIA claims. The Directors have exercised judgement that there is sufficient evidence and case law to support the Company's appeal against the Notices and no provisions to be recognised with regards to the potential tax liability.

(ii) Deferred tax assets

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences or unused tax losses can be utilised. This involves judgement regarding the future financial performance of the particular entity in which the deferred tax asset has been recognised, as disclosed in Note 12.

# 4 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS (CONTINUED)

The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are outlined below: (continued)

(f) Post-employment employee benefits

The Group and the Company provide both Retirement Benefit Plan and Post-Retirement Medical Plan for certain employees. The present value of the employee benefits obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using certain assumptions. The key assumptions used in determining the net cost/(income) for the employee benefits include discount rate, medical claim inflation rate and salary increment rate. Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of employee benefits obligations, as disclosed in Note 24.

Discount rate

The Group and the Company determine the appropriate discount rate at the end of each financial period. This is the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the pension obligations. In determining the appropriate discount rate, the Group and the Company consider the interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related employee benefits obligations.

Medical claim inflation rate

The medical claim inflation rate for general practitioner, hospitalisation, specialist and dialysis medical claims, as determined by the Group and the Company are based on the annualised increase in average claims over the past 5 years.

Salary increment rate

The salary increment rate for employees receiving the Retirement Benefit Plan as determined by the Group and the Company is based on the average salary increment rate for the past 13 years and considerations for price inflation, real salary increase, promotions and Collective Agreement ('CA') negotiation.

# 5 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ('PPE')

# Accounting Policy

PPE are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the construction or acquisition of the items and bringing them to the location and condition so as to render them operational in the manner intended by the Group and the Company and allocated according to its components.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the items can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised.

The cost of major overhaul/inspection is recognised in the asset's carrying amount as a replacement and the remaining carrying amount of the previous major overhaul/inspection is derecognised.

Major spare parts and standby equipment are recognised as assets when the Group and the Company expect to use for more than one period. Similarly, if the spare parts and servicing equipment can be used only in connection with an item of PPE, they are accounted for as PPE.

Gains or losses on disposal of PPE are determined by reference to their carrying amount and are recognised in statement of profit or loss.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

31 December 2023

# 5 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ('PPE') (CONTINUED)

# Accounting Policy (continued)

Freehold land and capital work-in-progress are not depreciated. Other PPE are depreciated on the straight line method to allocate the cost to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, summarised as follows:

<table><tr><td>Buildings and civil works</td><td>10 - 100 years</td></tr><tr><td>Plant and machinery</td><td>3 - 50 years</td></tr><tr><td>Lines and distribution mains</td><td>10 - 50 years</td></tr><tr><td>Distribution services</td><td>25 years</td></tr><tr><td>Meters</td><td>10 - 15 years</td></tr><tr><td>Public lighting</td><td>15 - 25 years</td></tr><tr><td>Furniture, fittings and office equipment</td><td>3 - 15 years</td></tr><tr><td>Motor vehicles</td><td>5 - 20 years</td></tr></table>

Residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate, on an annual basis.

At the end of the reporting period, the Group and the Company assess whether there is any indication of impairment. If such indications exist, an analysis is performed to assess whether the carrying amount of the asset is fully recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount (Note 3(c)).

# 6 RIGHT-OF-USE ('ROU') ASSETS

# Accounting Policy

A lease is a contract, or part of a contract, whereby the lessor conveys to the lessee the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Group and the Company assess whether:

The contract involves the use of an identified asset - this may be specified explicitly or implicitly, and should be physically distinct or represent substantially all of the capacity of a physically distinct asset. If the supplier ('lessor') has a substantive substitution right, then the asset is not identified;  
The customer ('lessee') has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset throughout the period of use; and  
The customer ('lessee') has the right to direct the use of the asset. In rare cases where the decision about how and for what purpose the asset is used is predetermined, the customer ('lessee') has the right to direct the use of the asset if either the customer ('lessee') has the right to operate the asset; or the customer designed the asset in a way that predetermines how and for what purpose it will be used.

The Group and the Company as lessees

The Group and the Company lease various buildings, plant and machinery, furniture and fittings, office equipment and motor vehicles. These leases have tenures between 1 and 25 years. Lease terms are generally negotiated on an individual basis. As for leasehold land, the remaining period of the respective leases ranges from 4 to 99 years.

(i) Initial recognition

The Group and the Company recognise a ROU asset and a lease liability for all leases conveying the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time.

The ROU assets recognised by the Group and the Company are initially recorded at cost, which comprise the following:

The amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability;  
Any lease payments made on or before the commencement date of the lease, less any lease incentives received;  
Any initial direct costs incurred by the Group and the Company; and  
An estimate of costs to be incurred by the Group and the Company in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, restoring the site on which it is located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the lessor.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date. The lease payments are discounted using the Group's incremental borrowing rate.

Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:

Fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable;  
Variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate;  
Amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;  
The exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and  
Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option.

(ii) Subsequent measurement

After initial recognition, the Group and the Company measure ROU assets at cost:

Less any accumulated depreciation;  
Less any accumulated impairment losses; and  
- Adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liabilities.

The Group and the Company measure the lease liability by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect lease payments made, and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessments or lease modifications. The interest on the lease liability is recognised as finance cost in the statement of profit or loss.

(iii) Extension and termination options

Extension and termination options are included in a number of property and equipment leases across the Group. In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated).

The assessment of reasonable certainty is reviewed if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs which affects this assessment and that is within the control of the lessee.

The Group and the Company have elected not to recognise ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets.

If an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, the Group and the Company apply MFRS 15 to allocate the consideration in the contract based on the stand-alone selling prices.

A ROU asset and its corresponding lease liability are recognised at the date the leased asset is available for used by the Group and the Company. Each lease payment is allocated between the principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to statement of profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The ROU asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.

At the end of the reporting period, the Group and the Company assess whether there is any indication of impairment. If such indication exists, an analysis is performed to assess whether the carrying amount of the asset is fully recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount (Note 3(c)).

(a) Movement in accumulated impairment losses for investment in subsidiaries was mainly contributed by the impairment assessment for Power and Energy International (Mauritius) Ltd. ('PEIM'):

During the financial year, the Company had undertaken the impairment assessment of its investment in PEIM, an investment holding company. Based on the impairment assessment which estimates the cash flow available for distribution from PEIM's divestment of its significant associate, GMR Energy Limited ('GEL') as disclosed in Note 9, the recoverable amount of the Company's investment in PEIM exceeded its carrying amount, hence a reversal of impairment loss of RM137.7 million (2022: NIL) was recognised in the current financial year.

# 8 JOINT ARRANGEMENTS

# Accounting Policy

A joint arrangement is an arrangement over which there is contractually agreed sharing of control by the Group with one or more parties where decisions about the relevant activities relating to the joint arrangement require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. The classification of a joint arrangement as a joint operation or a joint venture depends upon the rights and obligations of the parties to the arrangement. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the joint ventureers have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Joint operations are joint arrangements whereby the Company has the rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities. In respect of its interests in joint operations, the Company shall recognise in its financial statements the assets that it controls and the expenses and liabilities that it incurs and its share of the income that it earns from the sale of goods or services.

The Group's interest in joint ventures is accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting.

# 8 JOINT ARRANGEMENTS (CONTINUED)

# Accounting Policy (continued)

Equity accounting involves recognising in the consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of OCI and consolidated statement of changes in equity, the Group's share of profits less losses of the joint ventures based on the latest audited financial statements or management accounts of the joint ventures, made up to the financial year end of the Group. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the results and net assets of the joint ventures to ensure consistency of accounting policies with those of the Group. The Group's investments in joint ventures are recorded at cost inclusive of goodwill and adjusted thereafter for accumulated impairment losses and the post-acquisition change in the Group's share of net assets of the joint ventures.

Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in joint ventures. Unrealised losses are also eliminated on the same basis but only to the extent of the costs that can be recovered, and the balances that provide evidence of reduction in net realisable value or an impairment of the asset transferred are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# 9 ASSOCIATES

# Accounting Policy

Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control or joint control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between  $20.0\%$  and  $50.0\%$  of the voting rights.

Investments in associates are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost. Equity accounting is discontinued when the Group ceases to have significant influence over the associates.

The Group's share of its associates' post-acquisition profits or losses are recognised in the statement of profit or loss, and its share of post-acquisition movements in OCI are recognised in OCI. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group's share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interests in the associate, including any long term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group's net investment in the associate, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. If the associate subsequently reports profits, the Group resumes recognising its share of those profits only after its share of the profits equals the share of losses not recognised. The Group's investments in associates include goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses (Note 3(c)).

Profits and losses resulting from upstream and downstream transactions between the Group and its associates are recognised in the Group's financial statements only for the unrelated investor's interests in the associates. The accounting policies of associates are adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

Dilution of gains and losses in associates are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

If the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but significant influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognised in OCI is reclassified to statement of profit or loss where appropriate.

(a) Divestment in GEL

2023

During the financial year, the Group via its wholly owned subsidiary, PEIM, had completed the divestment of its entire  $30.0\%$  equity interest in GEL via a Settlement Agreement for an amount of RM133.0 million (USD28.5 million) in cash. Hence, GEL has ceased to be an associate of the Group.

# 9 ASSOCIATES (CONTINUED)

(a) Divestment in GEL (continued)

2023 (continued)

The initial value of the investment in GEL of RM1,259.7 million has been fully written down in previous financial years. Consequently, the Group has recognised a gain of RM21.3 million from this disposal:

(b) (i) Impairment assessment for Blyth Offshore Demonstrator Limited ('BODL')

2023

Due to adverse external market conditions, the Group had undertaken an impairment assessment of its investment in BODL in the current year. An impairment charge of RM31.2 million (GBP5.5 million) was recognised as its recoverable amount was lower than the carrying amount.

The recoverable amount of BODL was determined based on VIU calculations which applied a discounted free cash flow to equity model. The cash flows used are the most recent projections and sensitivity analysis was conducted to ensure the reliability of relevant variables.

(b) (ii) Impairment assessment for Lumut Maritime Terminal Sdn. Bhd. ('LMT')

2023

The Group had reviewed the basis of impairment parameter updated based on 2023 data. Based on the assessment, the recoverable amount exceeded its carrying amount, hence no additional impairment loss was recognised in the current financial year.

2022

The Group had undertaken the impairment assessment of its investment in LMT, an associate. The assessment was triggered by Net Zero 2050 initiative of no extension of Power Purchase Agreement ('PPA') provided for the coal fired power plant. Based on the impairment assessment, the carrying amount of the Group's investment in LMT exceeded its recoverable amount by RM68.6 million.

Key assumption used

The recoverable amount was determined based on VIU calculations, which applied a discounted cash flow model of LMT for the remaining operation and maintenance contract period which expires in 2042 and its other sources of income. The cash flows used in the calculations are the most recent forecasts and projections approved by the Board of Directors and management of LMT.

The key assumptions used in determining the VIU were:

<table><tr><td></td><td>2022 %</td></tr><tr><td>Terminal growth rate</td><td>2.0</td></tr><tr><td>Cost of equity</td><td>9.0</td></tr></table>

The cash flows were discounted using cost of equity based on the risk specific to the industry. The key assumptions include optimisation of LMT's assets and no new source of business.

The Group's review includes impact assessment of changes in key assumptions. The effects of the movement in the key assumptions to the recoverable amount are as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td rowspan="2">Changes in assumptions %</td><td colspan="2">Impact on recoverable amount</td></tr><tr><td>Increase RM&#x27;million</td><td>Decrease RM&#x27;million</td></tr><tr><td>Terminal growth rate</td><td>1.0</td><td>5.9</td><td>(4.4)</td></tr><tr><td>Cost of equity</td><td>1.0</td><td>(17.5)</td><td>23.1</td></tr></table>

# 10 INTANGIBLE ASSETS

# Accounting Policy

# Goodwill

Goodwill arises from a business combination and represents the excess of the aggregate of fair value of consideration transferred, the amount of any NCI in the acquiree and the fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the acquisition date. If the fair value of consideration transferred is less than the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquiree in the case of a bargain purchase, the resulting gain is recognised in statement of profit or loss.

Goodwill is recognised in the statement of financial position as non-current asset at cost less accumulated impairment losses and tested for impairment annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the CGUs, or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of VIU and the fair value less costs of disposal. Any impairment is recognised immediately to the statement of profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity disposed.

# Rights to build

The rights to build are stated at cost less any accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. The rights to build are considered to have a finite life. The asset is reviewed annually for adjustments to the useful economic life and any indications of impairment. Impairment losses are recognised when the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its VIU.

Subsequent costs involved in renewing or maintaining the rights to build are charged to the statement of profit and loss as and when incurred.

# 10 INTANGIBLE ASSETS (CONTINUED)

# Accounting Policy (continued)

Project development portfolio

The project development portfolio consists of contractual rights acquired relating to early stage solar, wind and Battery Energy Storage System ('BESS') projects in Australia.

The project development portfolio is stated at cost less any accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. They are considered to have a finite life and are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of expected future economic benefits of the asset. The asset is reviewed annually for adjustments to the useful economic life and any indications of impairment. Impairment losses are recognised when the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its VIU.

Subsequent costs involved in renewing or maintaining the development portfolio are charged to the statement of profit and loss as and when incurred.

# Impairment assessment for goodwill

The carrying value of goodwill is allocated to the Group's CGUs. The recoverable amount of the CGU including goodwill, is determined based on its VIU. This VIU calculation applies a discounted cash flow model using cash flow projections based on forecast approved by management. The forecasts reflect management's expectations of revenue growth, operating costs and margins for the CGUs based on current assessment of market share, expectations of market and industry growth.

The discount rate applied to the cash flow forecast refers to the industry's pre-tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital ('WACC').

(a) Goodwill relating to operations in Malaysia

The discounted cash flow model used cash flow projections which covered a five-year period and cash flows beyond the projection years are extrapolated using an estimated terminal growth rate.

The following key assumptions have been applied in the VIU calculation:

<table><tr><td></td><td>2023%</td><td>2022%</td></tr><tr><td>Revenue growth rate</td><td>2.1</td><td>1.8</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-tax discount rate</td><td>8.8</td><td>8.1</td></tr><tr><td>Terminal growth rate</td><td>1.9</td><td>1.8</td></tr></table>

Based on the Group's assessment, no impairment losses were required as at 31 December 2023 as the recoverable amount exceeded the carrying amount.

The Group's review includes an impact assessment of changes in key assumptions used. Based on the sensitivity analysis performed, it was concluded that no reasonable change in the base case assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.

(b) Goodwill relating to operations in the United Kingdom

The Group tests whether the goodwill has suffered any impairment on an annual basis. The Group has determined the recoverable amount of foreign CGU by assessing the VIU of the underlying assets. Based on the impairment assessment, the carrying value of the goodwill as at 31 December 2023 exceeded its recoverable amount by RM123.6 million (2022: RM22.7 million), mainly due to external market conditions affecting future cash flows.

# 10 INTANGIBLE ASSETS (CONTINUED)

Impairment assessment for goodwill (continued)

(b) Goodwill relating to operations in the United Kingdom (continued)

The discounted cash flow model used cash flow projections which covered a 27-year period (2022: 28-year period).

The following key assumptions has been applied in the VIU calculation:

<table><tr><td></td><td>2023%</td><td>2022%</td></tr><tr><td>Revenue growth rate</td><td>(3.5)</td><td>(3.2)</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-tax discount rate</td><td>8.4</td><td>7.8</td></tr></table>

The Group's review includes an impact assessment of changes in key assumptions used. The effects of the movement in the key assumptions to the recoverable amount are as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td rowspan="2">Changes in assumptions %</td><td colspan="2">Impact on recoverable amount</td></tr><tr><td>Increase RM&#x27;million</td><td>Decrease RM&#x27;million</td></tr><tr><td>2023</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Revenue growth rate</td><td>1.0</td><td>285.8</td><td>(252.7)</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-tax discount rate</td><td>1.0</td><td>(143.2)</td><td>161.7</td></tr><tr><td>2022</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Revenue growth rate</td><td>1.0</td><td>355.7</td><td>(312.7)</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-tax discount rate</td><td>1.0</td><td>(158.1)</td><td>176.3</td></tr></table>

(c) Goodwill relating to operations in Australia

The goodwill is deemed to be attributable to Spark Renewable's future ability to develop and operate new renewable energy projects in Australia, as well as enhanced scale and operational diversity in its renewable projects portfolio.

(d) Goodwill relating to operations in the Republic of Ireland

The goodwill consists of potential upsides from extension of lease terms and grid connection approvals up to 15 years.

# 12 DEFERRED TAXATION

# Accounting Policy

Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements including those arising from business combinations. Deferred tax is not recognised on goodwill and those arising from initial recognition of an asset or liability which at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and unutilised tax credits can be utilised. Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising on investment in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Tax benefit from reinvestment allowance is recognised when the tax credit is utilised and no deferred tax asset is recognised when the tax credit is receivable.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.

The Group and the Company will recognise a deferred tax asset and a deferred tax liability for any temporary differences arising on initial recognition of a lease transaction. Where applicable, a deferred tax asset is recognised as the Group and the Company is able to benefit from the tax deductions in the future. Any differences between the deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability will be recognised in the profit and loss. Upon adopting the amendments, the Group and the Company do not expect material adjustments to the retained earnings as the initial recognition of the lease transactions gave rise to equal and offsetting temporary differences.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred taxes relate to the same tax authority. The following amounts, determined after appropriate offsetting, are shown in the statement of financial position:

<table><tr><td rowspan="3"></td><td colspan="2">Group</td><td colspan="2">Company</td></tr><tr><td>2023</td><td>2022</td><td>2023</td><td>2022</td></tr><tr><td>RM&#x27;million</td><td>RM&#x27;million</td><td>RM&#x27;million</td><td>RM&#x27;million</td></tr><tr><td>Deferred tax assets:</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>- Deferred tax assets to be realised after more than 12 months</td><td>257.8</td><td>246.4</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>- Deferred tax assets to be realised within 12 months</td><td>121.5</td><td>131.1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>379.3</td><td>377.5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Deferred tax liabilities:</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>- Deferred tax liabilities to be settled after more than 12 months</td><td>(8,119.2)</td><td>(8,496.2)</td><td>(5,600.3)</td><td>(6,337.4)</td></tr><tr><td>- Deferred tax liabilities to be settled within 12 months</td><td>(899.1)</td><td>(324.1)</td><td>(890.9)</td><td>(302.9)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(9,018.3)</td><td>(8,820.3)</td><td>(6,491.2)</td><td>(6,640.3)</td></tr><tr><td>Net total</td><td>(8,639.0)</td><td>(8,442.8)</td><td>(6,491.2)</td><td>(6,640.3)</td></tr></table>

# 15 LEASES

# Accounting Policy

The Group and the Company as lessors

When the Group and the Company act as lessors, they determine at lease inception whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating lease. To classify each lease, the Group and the Company make an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease; otherwise, then it is an operating lease.

# Operating leases

Leases where the Group and the Company retain substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased assets are classified as operating leases. The Group and the Company recognise lease payments received under operating leases as operating income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

# Finance leases

If the Group and the Company transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased assets, leases are classified as finance leases. The Group and the Company derecognise the leased assets and recognise the net investment in the lease as a receivable. The difference between the gross receivable and the present value of the receivable is recognised as unearned finance income. Lease income is recognised over the term of the lease using the net investment method, which reflects a constant periodic rate of return.

The Group and the Company as lessees

The accounting policy on ROU assets and lease liabilities for lessees are disclosed in Note 6.

(a) Finance lease receivables

The Group's finance lease receivables arise from Cooling Energy Supply Agreement ('CESA').

# 17 CONTRACT BALANCES

# Accounting Policy

(a) Contract cost assets - Costs to fulfil a contract

The Group recognises a contract cost that relates directly to a contract or to an anticipated contract as an asset when the cost generates or enhances resources of the Group which will be used in satisfying performance obligations in the future and it is expected to be recovered.

These contract costs are initially measured at cost and amortised on a systematic basis that is consistent with the pattern of revenue recognition to which the asset relates. An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit or loss when the carrying amount of the contract cost exceeds the expected revenue less expected cost that will be incurred. Where the impairment condition no longer exists or has improved, the impairment loss is reversed to the extent that the carrying amount of the contract cost does not exceed the amount that would have been recognised had there been no impairment loss recognised previously.

(b) Trade contract assets

A trade contract asset is recognised when the Group's and the Company's rights to consideration are conditional on something other than the passage of time. A contract asset is subject to impairment in accordance to MFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' (Note 45). Typically, the amount will be billed within 30 days of the supply of electricity for electricity customers and 60 to 180 days for satisfying the performance obligation for other revenue streams. An assessment of electricity supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading and the financial year end of the Group and of the Company (unread and unbilled) was made and it is recognised as trade contract assets. Payment is expected within 30 days from the billing date for all trade receivables.

# 17 CONTRACT BALANCES (CONTINUED)

# Accounting Policy (continued)

# (c) Trade contract liabilities

A trade contract liability represents the obligation of the Group and of the Company to transfer goods or services to a customer for which consideration has been received (or the amount is due) from the customers.

Trade contract liabilities primarily relate to contributions paid by electricity customers for the construction of electricity network assets. The customers' contributions are expected to be recognised as revenue over a period of 20 years, being the estimated average useful life of the electricity network assets used to connect the customers to the electricity supply.

Other trade contract liabilities within the Group are relating to students fees. All other trade contract liabilities are expected to be recognised as revenue over the next 12 months.

# (d) Non-trade contract assets and liabilities

Non-trade contract balances are pertaining to insurance and reinsurance contracts which are recognised in accordance to MFRS 4 'Insurance Contracts'.

These balances have been classified as receivables (Note 21) and payables (Note 23) respectively as at 1 January 2023 upon adoption of MFRS 17.

The Group and the Company have recognised the following assets and liabilities related to contracts with customers:

(i) Significant changes in trade contract assets and liabilities

Trade contract assets have increased as the Group and the Company have provided more services ahead of the agreed payment schedules for fixed-price contracts. The Group and the Company also recognised a loss allowance for trade contract assets.

Trade contract liabilities have increased for the Group and the Company due to larger prepayments or contributions received from customers.

The following table shows how much of the revenue recognised in the current financial year relates to carried-forward trade contract liabilities and how much relates to performance obligations that were satisfied in a prior financial year:

Management expects  $5.0\%$  (2022: 5.5%) of the transaction price allocated to the unsatisfied contracts will be recognised as revenue during the next financial year. The remaining  $95.0\%$  (2022: 94.5%) will be recognised from financial years 2025 to 2043.

In respect of the supply of electricity, the Group and the Company applied the practical expedient to not disclose information related to the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations, on the basis that revenue is recognised from the satisfaction of the performance obligations upon the consumption of electricity by the customers.

All contracts for period of one year or less are billed based on services provided. The transaction price allocated to these unsatisfied contracts is not disclosed.

Trade and other receivables

Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. Other receivables generally arise from transactions outside the usual operating activities of the Group and the Company. If collection is expected in one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer), they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets.

Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value, which is the amount of consideration that is unconditional unless they contain significant financing components. The Group and the Company hold the trade receivables with the objective to collect the contractual cash flows and therefore measures them subsequently at amortised cost less accumulated impairment losses. The impairment is determined based on the ECL model and is further disclosed in Note 45.

# Insurance contracts

# Reinsurance contracts - initial recognition

The Group applies the premium allocation approach ('PAA') to all the reinsurance contracts it holds, as:

The coverage period of each contract in the group is one year or less, including insurance contract services arising from all premiums within the contract boundary; or  
- For contracts longer than one year, the Group has modelled possible future scenarios and reasonably expects that the measurement of the liability for remaining coverage for the Group containing those contracts under the PAA does not differ materially from the measurement that would be produced applying the general model. In assessing materiality, the Group has also considered qualitative factors such as the nature of the risk and types of its lines of business.

Insurance contracts (continued)

Reinsurance contracts - initial recognition (continued)

For a group of contracts that is not onerous at initial recognition, the Group measures the liability for remaining coverage as:

The premiums, if any, received at initial recognition;  
Minus any insurance acquisition cash flows at that date, with the exception of contracts which are one year or less where this is expensed;  
- Plus or minus any amount arising from the derecognition at that date of the asset recognised for insurance acquisition cash flows; and  
- Any other asset or liability previously recognised for cash flows related to the group of contracts that the Group pays or receives before the group of insurance contracts is recognised.

The Group calculates the loss-recovery component by multiplying the loss recognised on the underlying insurance contracts and the percentage of claims on the underlying insurance contracts the Group expects to recover from the group of reinsurance contracts held. The Group uses a systematic and rational method to determine the portion of losses recognised on the group to insurance contracts covered by the group of reinsurance contracts held where some contracts in the underlying group are not covered by the group of reinsurance contracts held.

Reinsurance contracts - subsequent measurement

The Group measures the carrying amount of the liability for remaining coverage at the end of each reporting period as the liability for remaining coverage at the beginning of the period:

- Plus premiums received in the period;  
- Minus insurance acquisition cash flows, with the exception of property insurance product line for which the Group chooses to expense insurance acquisition cash flows as they occur;  
- Plus any amounts relating to the amortisation of the insurance acquisition cash flows recognised as an expense in the reporting period for the group;  
- Plus any adjustment to the financing component, where applicable;  
- Minus the amount recognised as insurance revenue for the services provided in the period; and  
- Minus any investment component paid or transferred to the liability for incurred claims.

The Group estimates the liability for incurred claims as the fulfilment cash flows related to incurred claims. The fulfilment cash flows incorporate, in an unbiased way, all reasonable and supportable information available without undue cost or effort about the amount, timing and uncertainty of those future cash flows, they reflect current estimates from the perspective of the Group, and include an explicit adjustment for non-financial risk (the risk adjustment). The Group does not adjust the future cash flows for the time value of money and the effect of financial risk for the measurement of liability for incurred claims that are expected to be paid within one year of being incurred.

Where, during the coverage period, facts and circumstances indicate that a group of insurance contracts is onerous, the Group recognises a loss in profit or loss for the net outflow, resulting in the carrying amount of the liability for the group being equal to the fulfilment cash flows. A loss component is established by the Group for the liability for remaining coverage for such onerous group depicting the losses recognised.

Where the Group has established a loss-recovery component, the Group subsequently reduces the loss recovery component to zero in line with reductions in the onerous group of underlying insurance contracts in order to reflect that the loss-recovery component shall not exceed the portion of the carrying amount of the loss component of the onerous group of underlying insurance contracts that the entity expects to recover from the group of reinsurance contracts held.

Presentation

The Group has presented separately, in the statement of financial position, the carrying amounts of portfolios of reinsurance contracts issued that are assets in Note 21 and portfolios of reinsurance contracts held that are liabilities in Note 23.

# 23 PAYABLES

# Accounting Policy

Trade and other payables

Trade and other payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Other payables generally arise from transactions outside the usual operating activities of the Group and the Company. Trade and other payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer). If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.

Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, which is the fair value of the consideration to be paid in the future for the goods and services received.

# 23 PAYABLES (CONTINUED)

# Accounting Policy (continued)

# Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group and the Company have a present legal or constructive obligations as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligations and reliable estimates of the amounts can be made. Where the Group and the Company expect a provision to be reimbursed by another party, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.

Insurance contract liabilities

The accounting policy on insurance contract assets and liabilities are disclosed in Note 21.

# 24 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

# Accounting Policy

The Group and the Company have various post-employment benefit schemes which are either defined contribution or defined benefit plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group and the Company pay fixed contributions into a separate entity (a fund) on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis and the Group and the Company have no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees benefits relating to employee services in the current and prior periods.

# Defined contribution plans

The Group's and the Company's contributions to the defined contribution plans are charged to the statement of profit or loss in the financial year to which they relate. Once the contributions have been paid, the Group and the Company have no further payment obligations.

# Defined benefit plans

The Group and the Company make contributions to the Group and Company's Retirement Benefit Plan, a defined benefit plan and an approved fund independent of the Group and Company's finances. A book provision is also provided by the Group and the Company as the contribution rate required to fund the benefits under the said plan is in excess of the Inland Revenue maximum limit. The Group and the Company also provided for a Post-Retirement Medical Plan for certain employees, which is unfunded.

The liability in respect of a defined benefit plan is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the statement of financial position date minus the fair value of plan assets. The Group and the Company determine the present value of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of any plan assets with sufficient regularity such that the amounts recognised in the financial statements do not differ materially from the amounts that would be determined at the end of the reporting date.

The defined benefit obligation, calculated using the Projected Unit Credit Method, is determined by an independent actuarial firm, considering the estimated future cash outflows using market yields at the statement of financial position date of high-quality corporate bonds which have currency and terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related liability.

The current service cost of the defined benefit plan reflects the increase in the defined benefit obligation resulting from employee services in the current year. It is recognised in the statement of profit or loss as employee benefits expense.

The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefits obligation and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is included in employee benefit expense in the statement of profit or loss. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised directly to the OCI in the period in which they arise. The actuarial gains and losses are not subsequently reclassified to the statement of profit or loss.

# (i) Retirement Benefit Trust Fund ('RBTF')

The Group and the Company operate a final salary defined benefit plan. The benefit is made as lump sum payment at retirement or earlier exits due to death and early retirement. Currently, there is no minimum funding requirement under the law.

The RBTF exposes the Group and the Company to risks from interest rates from defined benefit being greater than expected due to assumptions such as salary increment or turnover rates not being borne out. The RBTF is also exposed to investment risks in relation to the assets of the plan. Any surplus in RBTF will be used to reduce any future contributions to be paid by the Group and the Company.

The funding of the RBTF is based on recommendation of the actuary and approved by the Group and the Company. The contributions by the Group and the Company are based on  $7.0\%$  (2022:  $7.0\%$ ) of the annual basic salaries of the members. The employees are not required to contribute to the plan.

The Group and the Company expect to contribute  $6.0\%$  (2022:  $6.0\%$ ) of the annual basic salaries of members to the plan in the next financial year.

(ii) Post-Retirement Medical Benefit Scheme ('PRMBS')

The Group and the Company operate a post-retirement medical benefits plan in Malaysia. The PRMBS is closed to new entrants effective on 1 September 1998 and 1 September 1990 for the Group and the Company, respectively. There is no minimum funding requirement under the current law. The PRMBS is unfunded.

The PRMBS exposes the Group and the Company to risks from interest rates and from defined benefits being greater than expected due to assumptions such as projection of medical benefit costs and mortality not being borne out.

There has not been any settlement or curtailment during the current financial year.

# 25 CONSUMER DEPOSITS

Consumers are required to deposit a sum sufficient to cover charges for two months supply of electricity as allowed under the regulation of the Licensee Supply (Amendment) Regulations 2002 (with the exception of employees, government departments/agencies and recipients of government assistance program for eKasih Group). In default of payment of the deposit within the time specified, the supply to the consumer's installation may be disconnected, subject to certain conditions laid out in the regulations.

An interest of  $2.5\%$  per annum is credited to the consumer's cash deposit.

Consumer deposits are classified as current liabilities as the amounts shall be refunded within 30 days upon request for termination of electricity supply by the consumer.

# 26 BORROWINGS

# Accounting Policy

Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods, borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, any differences between proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value are recognised in the statement of profit or loss over the period of the borrowings.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group and the Company have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the statement of financial position date.

Where the terms of a financial liability are renegotiated and the Group issues equity instruments to a debt holder to extinguish all or part of the liability (debt for equity swap), a gain or loss is recognised in statement of comprehensive income, which is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability and the fair value of the equity instruments issued, if any.

Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facilities will be drawdown. The transaction costs are amortised over the tenure of the loan and recognised in the statement of profit or loss.

Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the statement of profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.

Government loans, where the interest rate is below the market interest rate, the differential between the initial carrying value of the loan based on market rate and the Government rate is recognised as a deferred income and is credited to the statement of profit or loss over the period necessary to match the interest costs.

Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.

# 31 REVENUE

# Accounting Policy

Revenue which represents income arising in the course of the Group's and the Company's ordinary activities is recognised by reference to each distinct performance obligation promised in the contracts with customers. Revenue from contracts with customers is measured at its transaction price, being the amount of consideration which the Group and the Company expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, net of goods and service tax, returns, rebates and discounts. Transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on the basis of the relative stand-alone selling prices of each distinct good or services promised in the contract. Depending on the substance of the respective contract with the customer, revenue is recognised when the performance obligation is satisfied, which may be at a point in time or over time.

The Group and the Company do not expect any contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year. As a consequence, the Group and the Company do not adjust any of the transaction prices for the time value of money.

# (a) Electricity revenue

Revenue from the supply of electricity in Peninsular Malaysia (since 2014), Sabah and Wilayah Persekutuan Labuan (since 2022) is regulated based on certain formulae and parameters as set out in the regulatory implementation guidance under the IBR framework and as agreed with the regulators. The allowed revenue in each year is calculated as the sum of actual revenue earned and any applicable adjustments, such as those related to the Annual Regulatory Adjustment ('ARA'), allowance or top-up by the Government and other income adjustment mechanisms as described in the Guidelines on Electricity Tariff Determination.

The contract with customers is for the supply of electricity based on tariff rates as set out in the provision of the Electricity Supply Act 1990. Collection of the contract consideration from customers is considered probable.

The promise to supply electricity represents a promise to transfer a series of distinct goods that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. The performance obligation to deliver electricity is satisfied over time as the customers simultaneously received and consumed the benefits provided by the Group's and the Company's performance. Hence, electricity revenue is recognised over time by the Group and the Company when electricity is consumed by customers.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

31 December 2023

# 31 REVENUE (CONTINUED)

# Accounting Policy (continued)

(a) Electricity revenue (continued)

Generally, customers are billed monthly. As the amount at which the Group and the Company have a right to invoice corresponds directly with the value to the customer, the revenue from electricity sales is also recognised monthly. Payment should be made by customers within 30 days from the date the bill is issued. An interest charge will be imposed if payment is made later than 30 days after the bill date.

Electricity revenue includes an estimated value of the electricity consumed by customers from the date of their last meter reading and the reporting period end. Accrued unbilled revenues recognised as contract assets are reversed in the following month when actual billings occur.

Other income which is earned from services not directly related to electricity supply but are provided using the assets and/or staff of a licensee is deducted from the revenues to be earned from regulated tariffs.

(b) Goods and services

(i) Sale of goods

Sale of goods is recognised when control of the products has transferred, being when the products are delivered to the customer and there is no unfulfilled obligation that could affect the customer's acceptance of the products. Delivery occurs when the products have been transported to the specific location, the risks of obsolescence and loss have been transferred to the customer, and either the customer has accepted the products in accordance with the sales contract, the acceptance provisions have lapsed, or the Group has objective evidence that all criteria for acceptance have been satisfied.

Revenue from these sales is recognised based on the price specified in the contract, net of the estimated discounts. Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for the discounts, using the expected value method, and revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. No element of financing is deemed present as the sales are made with a credit term of an average between 30 to 60 days, which is consistent with market practice. The Group's obligation to repair or replace faulty products under the standard warranty terms is recognised as a provision.

A receivable is recognised when the goods are delivered as this is the point in time that the consideration is unconditional because only the passage of time is required before the payment is due.

(ii) Rendering of services

Revenue from providing services is recognised over the period in which the services are rendered. Revenue is recognised based on the actual service provided to the end of the reporting period as a proportion of the total services to be provided because the customer received and uses the benefits simultaneously.

In cases of fixed-price contracts, the customer pays the fixed amount based on a payment schedule. If the services rendered exceed the payments, a contract asset is recognised. If the payments exceed the services rendered, a contract liability is recognised.

If the contract includes hourly fees, revenue is recognised at the amount to which the Group has a right to invoice. The amounts are billed within 60 to 180 days from satisfying the performance obligations and payment is expected within 30 days from the billing date.

# 31 REVENUE (CONTINUED)

# Accounting Policy (continued)

# (c) Construction contracts

Revenue from construction contracts is recognised over time or at a point in time in accordance with performance obligations being satisfied. Where revenue is recognised over time, the satisfaction of performance obligation is by reference to the stage of completion which is assessed by reference to the contract costs incurred over the total estimated costs for each contract as at the reporting date. Otherwise, revenue is recognised at a point in time when the customer obtains control of the assets. The related costs are recognised in the statement of profit or loss when they are incurred.

Where the contracts include multiple performance obligations, the transaction price will be allocated to each performance obligation based on the stand-alone selling prices. Where these are not directly observable, they are estimated based on expected cost plus margin. If contracts include sale of goods as a separate performance obligation, revenue from this sale is recognised at a point in time when the goods are delivered, the legal title has passed and the customer has accepted the goods.

When the consideration of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised only to the extent of contract costs incurred that are likely to be recoverable. An expected loss on a contract is recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss.

Estimates of revenues, costs or extent of progress toward completion are revised if circumstances change. Any resulting increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs are reflected in the statement of profit or loss in the period in which the circumstances that give rise to the revision become known by management.

The amounts will be billed within 60 to 180 days from satisfying the performance obligations and payment is expected within 30 days from billing date. Advances received are included in contract liabilities.

# (d) Customers' contributions

Contributions received from customers in the form of cash and/or PPE in respect of capital contributions for the construction of assets, used to connect the customers to a network or to provide them with the service, is included in the revenue.

The customers' contributions are viewed as indirectly related to the promise of providing supply of electricity to the customers. Supply of electricity and customers' contributions are not distinct because the customers cannot benefit from these two services on their own. The connection infrastructures are to fulfil the obligation to supply electricity to the customers. Both the supply of electricity and customers' contributions are substantially the same, and have the same pattern of transfer to the customers.

Therefore, connection and the supply of electricity are one performance obligation. It is considered as part of the transaction price for the overall service provided to the customers and is recognised over time. The customers' contributions are deferred and recognised over the period the constructed assets are used to provide electricity to the customers. The contributions are recognised as contract liabilities and amortised over 20 years, being the estimated average useful life of the assets.

# (e) Insurance contract revenue

Insurance revenue is recognised based on the expected premium receipts and the passage of time over the coverage period of a group of contracts unless the release of risk differs significantly from the passage of time, in which case insurance revenue is recognised based on the release of risk.

# 32 IMBALANCE COST PASS-THROUGH ('ICPT') UNDER RECOVERY

# Accounting Policy

ICPT, a mechanism established under the IBR framework allows the Group and the Company to pass through the volatility in fuel and other generation specific costs (termed as the 'Single Buyer Generation Cost') to the customers, such that the Group and the Company remain financially neutral. The Group's and the Company's claims and undertakings under the ICPT mechanism are such that any over or under recovery of these costs would be payable to or reimbursable from the Government. Upon approval by the Government, the agreed over or under recovery costs will be adjusted in the billing to customers, as ICPT rebate or surcharge. Actual base tariff billed to the customers remains unchanged.

The ICPT over or under recovery is recognised in the statement of profit or loss, presented separately from revenue.

# LTIP

The Group and the Company operate an equity-settled share-based compensation plan under which the entity receives services from employees as consideration for equity instruments of the Group.

The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the Company's shares is recognised as an expense in the statement of profit or loss over the vesting period of the grant, with a corresponding increase in share-based payment reserve in equity.

The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares granted.

Non-market vesting conditions are included in the assumptions to arrive at the number of shares that are expected to vest. At the end of the reporting period, the Company revises its estimates of the number of shares that are expected to be vested. The impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, is recognised in the statement of profit or loss, with a corresponding adjustment to share-based payment reserve in equity.

The fair value of shares granted to employees of subsidiaries is allocated to the subsidiaries.

The Company implemented a LTIP on 30 April 2015 for a period of 10 years. The LTIP is governed by the by-laws, which was approved by the shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting on 18 December 2014. LTIP is intended to allow the Company to award the grant of new shares to be vested to selected employees for the attainment of identified performance objectives.

# (a) The main features of the LTIP

The LTIP comprises a Restricted Share Grant ('RS Grant') and a Performance Share Grant ('PS Grant'). The main difference in the features of the RS Grant and the PS Grant is the eligibility of the selected employees in terms of their job grades in the Group and the performance targets and/or performance conditions to be met prior to the offer and vesting of the grant to the selected employees.

The details of the grant are as follows:

(i) RS Grant

The RS Grant is a restricted share grant for all eligible employees selected on a basis designated by the LTIP Committee. The RS Grant will be awarded annually to the selected employees to be vested over a period of 3 years on a pro-rata basis and after fulfilment of individual performance targets based on the Group's performance management system (such as individual performance rating) and certain performance conditions (such as financial targets) as determined by the LTIP Committee from time to time at its discretion in accordance with the terms and conditions of the LTIP.

(a) The main features of the LTIP (continued)

The details of the grant are as follows: (continued)

(ii) PS Grant

The PS Grant is a performance share grant for senior executives of the Group and the Executive Director as well as key employees of the Group selected on a basis designated by the LTIP Committee. The PS Grant will be awarded annually to the selected employees to be vested at the end of the 3-year period and after fulfilment of certain performance targets and/or conditions at the time of grant and vesting, which may include, among other factors, total shareholders' return and the long term financial performance targets/ratios of the Group as determined by the LTIP Committee from time to time at its discretion in accordance with the terms and conditions of the LTIP. At the point of vesting, the final award of the PS Grant is based on a multiple of the initial grant whereby the multiple is determined according to the performance targets and/or conditions. In the event the performance targets and/or conditions are not met by the selected employees, the grant will not be vested to them at the end of the performance period.

The new ordinary shares to be allotted and issued upon the vesting of the ordinary shares pursuant to the RS Grant and PS Grant will not be subjected to any retention period or restriction on transfer.

In implementing the LTIP, the grant will be satisfied by way of allotment and issuance of new ordinary shares to the respective RS and PS grantees upon vesting of the grant.

The LTIP Committee shall decide from time to time at its discretion to determine or vary the terms and conditions of the offer, such as the eligibility criteria and allocation in each grant, the timing and frequency of the award of the grant, the performance targets and/or performance conditions to be met prior to the offer and vesting of the grant and the vesting period.

(b) Maximum number of new ordinary shares available under the LTIP

The maximum number of new ordinary shares which may be made available under the LTIP and/or allotted and issued upon vesting of the new ordinary shares under the LTIP shall not be more than  $10.0\%$  of the issued and paid-up ordinary share capital of the Company (excluding treasury shares) at any point in time during the duration of the LTIP.

(c) Basis of allocation and maximum allowable allotment

The total number of new ordinary shares that may be offered to any one of the selected employees and/or to be vested in any one of the grantees under the LTIP at any time shall be at the discretion of the LTIP Committee (subject to the by-laws and any applicable law).

(d) Eligibility

Employees of the Group and of the Company (including the Executive Director) who meet the following criteria as at the date of offer shall be eligible to be considered as an eligible employee to participate in the LTIP:

(i) Has attained the age of 18 years;  
(ii) Has entered into a full-time or fixed-term contract of employment with, and is on the payroll of any company within the Group and has not served a notice of resignation or received a notice of termination;  
(iii) Whose service/employment has been confirmed in writing;  
(iv) Is not a non-executive or independent director of the Company; and  
(v) Has fulfilled any other eligibility criteria which has been determined by the LTIP Committee at its discretion from time to time, as the case may be.

The LTIP Committee may determine any other eligibility criteria for the purpose of selecting an eligible employee at any time and from time to time, at its discretion.

# 34 STAFF COST (CONTINUED)

LTIP (continued)

(e) Ranking of the new ordinary shares

The new ordinary shares to be allotted and issued pursuant to the LTIP shall, upon allotment and issuance, rank equally in all respects with the then existing issued ordinary shares.

The new ordinary shares to be allotted and issued pursuant to the vesting of the grant under the LTIP shall not be entitled to any dividends, rights, allotments and/or any other distributions, for which the entitlement date is prior to the date on which the new ordinary shares are credited into the Central Depository System ('CDS') accounts of the respective grantees upon vesting of the grant under the LTIP.

# 36 FOREIGN EXCHANGE LOSS

# Accounting Policy

(a) Functional and presentation currency

Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the 'functional currency'). The financial statements are presented in Ringgit Malaysia ('RM'), which is the Company's functional and presentation currency.

(b) Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are remeasured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the statement of profit or loss. However, exchange differences are deferred in OCI when they are attributable to items that form part of the net investment in a foreign operation.

(c) Group companies

The results and financial positions of the Group's entities that have functional currencies which are different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:

(i) Assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that statement of financial position;  
(ii) Income and expenses for each statement of profit or loss and OCI are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions); and  
(iii) All resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate. Exchange differences arising on these items are recognised in OCI.

On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are taken to shareholders' equity.

On the disposal of a foreign operation (that is, a disposal of the Group's entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, a disposal involving loss of joint control over a joint venture that includes a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of significant influence over an associate that includes a foreign operation), the cumulative amount of the exchange differences relating to that foreign operation recognised in OCI, and accumulated in the separate component of equity, are reclassified from equity to statement of profit or loss, as part of the gain or loss on disposal.

# 37 FINANCE INCOME/COST AND FAIR VALUE CHANGES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

# Accounting Policy

Finance income are interests received from investments or financial instruments.

Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowing pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.

Finance income is calculated by applying the effective interest method to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset except for financial assets that subsequently become credit impaired. For credit-impaired financial assets the effective interest rate is applied to the net carrying amount of the financial assets (after deduction of the loss allowances).

The accounting policy on fair value changes are as per disclosed in Note 45.

General and specific borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised during the period of time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use. Qualifying assets are assets that necessarily takes substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use. Other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.

Accounting policy on finance charges for lease liabilities and government grants are disclosed in Notes 15 and Note 27, respectively.

# 38 TAXATION AND ZAKAT

# Accounting Policy

(a) Income tax

Current tax expense is determined by the expected income taxes payable in respect of the taxable profit for the financial year and is measured using the applicable tax rates according to the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period in the countries in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate the taxable profits.

Management periodically evaluates the positions taken in its tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation. Provisions are established where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

Tax is recognised in the statement of profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in OCI. In this case, the item is recognised in OCI, net of tax.

The Group and the Company recognise non-current tax recoverable on an undiscounted basis.

(b) Zakat

The Group and the Company recognise its obligation towards the payment of zakat on business income in the statement of profit or loss. Zakat payment is an obligation and is accrued based on  $2.5\%$  of profit before tax and determined according to the percentage of Muslim shareholding in the Company.

# 42 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND MATERIAL LITIGATIONS

# Accounting Policy

The Group and the Company do not recognise contingent assets and liabilities other than those arising from business combinations, but disclose its existence in the financial statements. A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Group and of the Company or a present obligation that is not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation. A contingent liability also arises in the extremely rare case where there is a liability that cannot be recognised because it cannot be measured reliably. However, contingent liabilities do not include financial guarantee contracts. A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Group and of the Company. The Group and the Company do not recognise contingent assets but disclose its existence where inflows of economic benefits are probable, but not certain.

Determination of the treatment of contingent liabilities is based on the Group's and the Company's view of the expected outcome of the contingencies after consulting legal counsel for litigation cases and internal and external experts to the Group and the Company for matters in the ordinary course of business.

# 42 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND MATERIAL LITIGATIONS (CONTINUED)

Contingent liabilities (continued)

All third party claims are being resolved and the Directors are of the opinion that their outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on the financial positions of both the Group and the Company.

claims by third parties include claims by contractors, consumers and statutory body. These claims are being addressed and the Directors are of the opinion that their ultimate resolution will not have a material effect on the financial position of the Group and the Company.

Trade guarantees and performance bonds provided to third parties for the benefit of the Group and the Company are for normal and ongoing business requirements consistent with generally acceptable and recognised industry practices. The liability would only trigger upon the default of the Group's and the Company's obligations under the guarantees and bonds. At the reporting date, the likelihood of the guarantees and bonds being called upon is remote.

Material litigations

(a) Reinvestment allowance ('RIA')

On 7 December 2016, the Company and the Inland Revenue Board of Malaysia ('IRB') entered into a consent judgement before the Kuala Lumpur High Court to substitute judicial review proceedings for notices of additional assessment dated 23 November 2015 for Years of Assessment ('YA') 2013 and 2014 amounting to RM2,068.2 million (referred to as 'Notices 1') arising from the disallowance of the Company's RIA claims. The consent judgement also stipulates that the IRB will not commence any proceedings relating to the Notices 1 until the matter is determined by the Special Commissioners of Income Tax ('SCIT') and the High Court, if there is a subsequent appeal by either party. On 15 December 2016, the Company filed appeals against the Notices 1 to the SCIT according to Section 99(1) of the Income Tax Act 1967, which have since been registered before the SCIT. However, the hearing at SCIT is adjourned pending the Court of Appeal's decision on 16 May 2024 in relation to notice of additional assessment for the YA 2018.

Meanwhile, for the notices of additional assessment issued for the YAs 2015, 2016, and 2017 amounting to RM3,977.9 million (referred to as 'Notices 2'), both the Company and the IRB recorded a consent order for judicial review application before the High Court on 30 December 2020. On 22 August 2023, the High Court allowed the Company's judicial review application to set aside the Notices 2. The High Court agreed that the Company is in the business of manufacturing electricity and as such, the Company is entitled to claim RIA on the capital expenditures which were incurred in the YAs 2015, 2016 and 2017 in the course of expanding, modernising and automating its business. In response, on 25 August 2023, the IRB filed a notice of appeal against the High Court's decision. The Court of Appeal has fixed the hearing date on 3 October 2024.

With regards to the notice of additional assessment for the YA 2018 amounting to RM1,812.5 million (referred to as 'Notice 3'), both the Company and the IRB recorded a consent order for judicial review application before the High Court on 21 January 2021. On 8 February 2022, the High Court allowed with cost, the Company's judicial review application to set aside the Notice 3. The High Court agreed that the Company is in the business of manufacturing electricity and as such, the Company is entitled to claim RIA on the capital expenditure which was incurred in the YA 2018 in the course of expanding, modernising and automating its business. Separately, on 8 February 2022, the IRB filed a notice of appeal against the High Court's decision. Subsequent to the hearing and case management at the Court of Appeal on 6 February 2024 and 7 February 2024 respectively, the Court of Appeal has fixed the decision date on 16 May 2024.

The Company has obtained legal advice from its tax solicitors on the merits of the cases mentioned above and on this basis, the Directors are of the opinion that there is no possible obligation, therefore no provision is required in the financial statements for the potential tax liability up to the reporting date.

Notwithstanding with the above, the Company continued to claim the RIA for YAs 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 based on the legal advice, as the Directors of the view that it is permitted by the law.

# 42 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND MATERIAL LITIGATIONS (CONTINUED)

Material litigations (continued)

(b) KEV

On 29 October 2021, the IRB disallowed the interest expenses incurred by KEV in relation to the Redeemable Unsecured Loan Stock granted to KEV by the Company and Malakoff Corporation Berhad under Section 33(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1967 and KEV's revision of revenue for YAs 2004 to 2009. As a result thereof, the IRB issued notices of assessment for the YAs 2011, 2012 and 2014 and notices of additional assessment for the YAs 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 amounting in aggregate to RM595.9 million.

On 16 November 2021, KEV commenced a judicial review against the Minister of Finance at the High Court to challenge the matters arising from the above-mentioned notices. Pursuant to an out-of-court settlement with the IRB, KEV has withdrawn the judicial review application before the High Court on 21 June 2023.

The out-of-court settlement had no material impact to the Group's financial position.

(c) Southern Power Generation Sdn. Bhd. ('SPG')

On 26 May 2023, the IRB issued notices of assessment for YAs 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 amounting in aggregate to RM78.5 million to SPG.

On 6 June 2023, SPG filed a judicial review against the IRB at the High Court to challenge the matters arising from the above-mentioned notices. Subsequently, on 14 September 2023, the High Court granted leave to SPG to commence judicial review against the IRB and granted an interim stay of all further proceedings including the enforcement until the substantive hearing on 11 January 2024. Due to an ongoing discussion with a view to a proposed settlement with the IRB, the substantive hearing was vacated. The High Court has fixed a new hearing date on 28 March 2024.

Based on the legal advice obtained from its tax solicitors on the merits of the case, SPG is of the view that the proposed settlement with IRB will not have a material impact to the financial statements.

Notwithstanding with the above, SPG continued to claim tax deductions for YAs 2022 and 2023 as permitted by the law.

# 44 SEGMENTAL REPORTING

Segmental reporting is not presented as the Group is principally engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sales of electricity and the provision of other related services, which are substantially within a single business segment and this is consistent with the current practice of internal reporting. The Group operates primarily in Malaysia.

# 45 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

# Accounting Policy

Financial instruments comprise financial assets and financial liabilities as below:

# Financial assets

# (a) Classification

The Group and the Company classify their financial assets in the following categories: at amortised cost ('AC'), at FVOCI or FVTPL. The classification depends on the entity's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows.

# (i) Financial assets at AC:

The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash flows; and  
The contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest.

# (ii) Financial assets at FVOCI:

Equity securities which are not held for trading, and which the Group and the Company have irrevocably elected at initial recognition to recognise in this category. These are strategic investments and the Group and the Company consider this classification to be more relevant; and  
- Debt securities where the contractual cash flows are solely principal and interest and the objective of the Group's and of the Company's business model is achieved both by collecting cash flows and selling financial assets.

# (iii) Financial assets at FVTPL:

- Debt instruments that do not qualify for measurement at either AC or FVOCl;  
Equity instruments that are held for trading; and  
Equity instruments for which the Group and the Company have not elected to recognise fair value gains and losses through OCI.

The Group and the Company reclassify debt instruments when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes.

# (b) Recognition and derecognition

Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade-date, the date on which the Group and the Company commit to purchase or sell the assets. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group and the Company have transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.

# (c) Measurement

# (i) Initial recognition

On initial recognition, the Group and the Company measure a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVTPL are expensed in the statement of profit or loss.

Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest.

# 45 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)

# Accounting Policy (continued)

Financial instruments comprise financial assets and financial liabilities as below: (continued)

Financial assets (continued)

(c) Measurement (continued)

(ii) Subsequent measurement

Debt instruments

Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group's and the Company's business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories into which the Group and the Company classify its debt instruments:

- AC: Interest income from financial assets at AC is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in the statement of profit or loss. Impairment losses are presented as a separate line item in the statement of profit or loss.  
- FVOCI: Movements in the carrying amount of debt instruments classified under FVOCI are taken through OCI. Upon derecognition of the assets, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified to the statement of profit or loss. The interest income from these financial assets is included in the finance income using the effective interest rate method. The foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment expenses are presented as a separate line item in the statement of profit or loss.  
- FVTPL: Financial assets that do not meet the criteria for AC or FVOCI are measured at FVTPL. A gain or loss on debt instruments which are measured at FVTPL are recognised in the statement of profit or loss.

Equity instruments

The Group and the Company have elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity instruments in OCI. The fair value gains and losses of these instruments will not be reclassified subsequently to the statement of profit or loss. Dividends from such investments are recognised in the statement of profit or loss as other income. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) on equity instruments measured at FVOCI are also reported as other changes in fair value.

(d) Impairment

The Group and the Company assess on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments carried at AC and FVOCI. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.

The Group and the Company have the following financial instruments that are subject to the ECL model:

(i) Trade receivables  
(ii) Trade contract assets  
(iii) Non-trade receivables:

intercompany balances  
amounts due from associates/joint ventures  
- rechargeable job orders ('RJO') debtors  
sundry deposits for rental spaces  
- rental receivables  
staff loans/advances  
investment in unquoted debt securities

(iv) Financial guarantee contracts issued

While cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirements of MFRS 9, the identified impairment loss is immaterial.

# Accounting Policy (continued)

Financial instruments comprise financial assets and financial liabilities as below: (continued)

Financial assets (continued)

(d) Impairment (continued)

ECL represents a probability-weighted estimate of the difference between the present value of the cash flows according to the contract and present value of the cash flows the Group and the Company are expected to receive, over the remaining life of the financial instruments. For financial guarantee contracts, the ECL is the difference between the expected payments to be reimbursed to the holder of the guaranteed debt instrument less any amounts that the Company expects to receive from the holder, the debtor or any other party.

The measurement of ECL reflects:

(i) An unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes;  
(ii) The time value of money; and  
(iii) Reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.

For trade receivables, trade contract assets and lease receivables, the Group and the Company apply the MFRS 9 simplified approach, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables, except for those which are in default or credit impaired are assessed individually.

For non-trade receivables, at each reporting date the Group and the Company measure ECL through a loss allowance at an amount equal to 12 months ECL if credit risk on a financial instrument or a group of financial instruments has not increased significantly since initial recognition.

The Group and the Company use the three-stage approach for non-trade receivables which reflect their credit risks and how the loss allowances are determined for each of those stages. Summary of the assumptions underpinning the Group's and the Company's ECL model for non-trade receivables are as follows:

<table><tr><td>Types of non-trade receivables</td><td>Stage 1
Low credit risk
(12 months ECL Model)</td><td>Stage 2
Significant increase in credit risk (Lifetime ECL Model)</td><td>Stage 3
Credit impaired
(Lifetime ECL Model)</td></tr><tr><td>• Intercompany balances</td><td>Positive operating cash flows/Net assets (Total Assets - Total Liabilities)/ Subsidiaries with assets under construction having guaranteed long term revenue contract and agents</td><td>Negative operating cash flows and net liabilities (Total Assets - Liabilities)/ without defaulting on loan repayments</td><td>Dormant/History of default</td></tr><tr><td>• Amounts due from associates/joint ventures/investment in unquoted debt security</td><td>Positive operating cash flows/ Net assets (Total Assets - Total Liabilities)</td><td>Negative operating cash flows and net liabilities (Total Assets - Total Liabilities)/No current default</td><td>History of default and currently defaulted</td></tr><tr><td>• RJO debtors</td><td>Covered by indent/ downpayment/Letter of Undertaking (&#x27;LOU&#x27;)</td><td>No indent/downpayment/LOU</td><td>Accident cases</td></tr><tr><td>• Sundry deposits for rental spaces</td><td>Active contracts</td><td>Inactive contracts and amounts outstanding less or equal to 12 months</td><td>Inactive contracts and amounts outstanding more than 12 months</td></tr><tr><td>• Rental receivables (net deposits)</td><td>Active contracts and amounts outstanding less or equal to 3 months</td><td>Active contracts and amounts outstanding more than 3 months</td><td>Inactive contracts</td></tr><tr><td>• Staff loans/advances</td><td>Current employees</td><td>Ex-employees with no default in payment</td><td>Ex-employees with default in payment</td></tr></table>

Financial assets (continued)

(d) Impairment (continued)

When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECL, the Group and the Company consider reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group's and the Company's historical experience and informed credit assessment including forward looking information, where available.

The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or fully) to the extent that there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when either the Group or the Company determine that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subjected to the write off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group's and the Company's procedures for recovery of amounts due.

Financial liabilities

The Group and the Company classify its financial liabilities at AC or at FVTPL.

Offsetting financial instruments

Financial assets and liabilities are offsetted and the net amounts are presented in the statement of financial position when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy.

Financial guarantee contracts

Financial guarantee contracts are contracts that require the Group or the Company to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due, in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument.

Financial guarantee contracts are recognised as a financial liability at the time the guarantee is issued. The liability is initially measured at fair value and subsequently at the higher of;

(i) The amount determined in accordance with the ECL model; and  
(ii) The amount initially recognised less, where appropriate, the cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the principles of MFRS 15.

The fair value of financial guarantees is determined as the present value of the difference in net cash flows between the contractual payments under the debt instrument and the payments that would be required without the guarantee, or the estimated amount that would be payable to a third party for assuming the obligations.

Where guarantees in relation to loans or other payables of associates are provided for no compensation, the fair values are accounted for as contributions and recognised as part of the cost of the investment.

(b) Financial risk management

The Group and the Company have exposures to the following risks embedded in its financial instruments:

Credit risk;  
- Liquidity risk; and  
Market risk.

# Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of a financial loss to the Group and the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. The Group's and the Company's exposures to credit risk arise principally from its receivables from customers, investment in unquoted debt security, deposits, bank and cash balances and derivative financial instruments. In addition, the Company's exposure to credit risk arises principally from loans and advances to subsidiaries and financial guarantees given to banks in respect of banking facilities granted to certain subsidiaries and an associate.

Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk

The Group and the Company have a credit policy in place and the exposures to credit risk are monitored on an ongoing basis. Normally, financial guarantees given by banks, shareholders or directors of customers are obtained, and credit evaluations are performed on customers requiring credit over a certain amount.

Exposure to credit risk, credit quality and collateral

The Group's and the Company's credit policy provide trade receivables with a 30 to 90 days (2022: 30 to 90 days) credit period. The Group and the Company have no major significant concentration of credit risk due to their diverse customer base. An impairment has been made for estimated unrecoverable amounts, determined by reference to past default experience of individual debtors and collection portfolios.

The total trade receivables and trade contract assets and the impairment provided are as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">Group</td><td colspan="2">Company</td></tr><tr><td>2023

The Group and the Company have other financial assets which are lease receivables, investment in unquoted debt security and others.

The Group and the Company apply MFRS 9 simplified approach to measure expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables and trade contract assets.

For certain large customers with high risk of default, the Group and the Company assessed the risk of loss for each customer individually based on their financial information, past trend of payments and external credit ratings, where applicable.

To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables and trade contract assets are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. The trade contract assets that relate to unbilled customers have substantial same risk characteristics as the trade receivables for the same types of contracts. The Group and the Company have therefore concluded that the expected loss rates for trade receivables are a reasonable approximation of the loss rates of the trade contract assets.

(b) Financial risk management (continued)

Credit risk (continued)

(i) Trade receivables and trade contract assets (continued)

Impairment losses (continued)

The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period of 14 months and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables. The Group and the Company have identified growth rates of real Gross Domestic Product ('GDP') of Malaysia to be the most relevant factor, and accordingly, adjusts the historical loss rates based on the expected changes in this factor. As at 31 December 2023, for non-government customers, a combination of growth rates of real GDP and inflation rates were identified as the most relevant factors.

On that basis, the loss allowance was determined for both trade receivables and trade contract assets as reflected in the earlier tables.

During the financial year, the collection trends of the Group's and the Company's trade receivables continued to improve. The Group and the Company revised the expected cash flows from their trade receivables which resulted in a reversal of impairment loss.

The Group and the Company also written off the inactive trade receivables which had been fully impaired in the previous financial years, therefore there was no impact to the net trade receivables.

The opening loss allowances for trade receivables and trade contract assets reconciled to the closing loss allowances are as follows:

Credit risk (continued)

(i) Trade receivables and trade contract assets (continued)

Impairment losses (continued)

Trade receivables are secured by deposits in the form of cash and bank guarantees. ECL is not provided on receivable balances fully secured by deposits. The deposit amounts are reviewed on an individual basis periodically.

Individual receivables which were known to be uncollectible were written off by reducing the carrying amount directly.

Impairment losses on trade receivables and trade contract assets are presented as net impairment losses within operating profit. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the same line item.

(ii) Investment in unquoted debt security, deposits, bank and cash balances, derivative financial instruments and financial assets at FVTPL

Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk

Investments, deposits, bank and cash balances, derivative financial instruments and financial assets measured at FVTPL are liquid security and mainly with reputable financial institutions.

Investment in unquoted debt security are investment in an associate's financial instruments. The credit risk of this associate is monitored on a quarterly basis and the loss allowances are provided for accordingly.

Exposure to credit risk, credit quality and collateral

The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amounts in the SOFP.

In view of the sound credit rating of counterparties, the Group and the Company do not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations. The Group and the Company do not have overdue investments that have not been impaired.

The investments, deposits, cash and bank balances and derivative financial instruments are unsecured.

Bank and cash balances are held with banks and financial institutions which have lower credit risks. In addition, some of the bank balances are insured by Government agencies. Consequently, the Group and the Company are of the view that the loss allowance is not material and hence, it is not provided for.

The total investment in unquoted debt security and the impairment provided are as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan="3"></td><td colspan="2">Company</td></tr><tr><td>2023</td><td>2022</td></tr><tr><td>RM&#x27;million</td><td>RM&#x27;million</td></tr><tr><td>Investment in unquoted debt security</td><td>287.5</td><td>278.5</td></tr><tr><td>Less: Loss allowances</td><td>(28.2)</td><td>(25.1)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>259.3</td><td>253.4</td></tr></table>

Impairment losses

The impairment for the remaining investment in unquoted debt security, deposits, bank and cash balances, derivative financial instruments and financial assets at FVTPL during the financial year and previous financial year was insignificant.

Intercompany balances

Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk

The Company provides unsecured loans and advances to subsidiaries. The Company monitors the results of the subsidiaries regularly.

Exposure to credit risk, credit quality and collateral

At the end of the financial year, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by their carrying amounts in the SOFP.

The total amounts due from subsidiaries and impairment provided are as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan="3"></td><td colspan="2">Company</td></tr><tr><td>2023</td><td>2022</td></tr><tr><td>RM&#x27;million</td><td>RM&#x27;million</td></tr><tr><td>Amounts due from subsidiaries</td><td>8,550.8</td><td>10,590.8</td></tr><tr><td>Less: Loss allowances</td><td>(573.2)</td><td>(573.9)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>7,977.6</td><td>10,016.9</td></tr></table>

# Impairment losses

Generally, the Company considers loans and advances to subsidiaries having low credit risk. The Company assumes that there is a significant increase in credit risk when a subsidiary's financial position deteriorates significantly based on stages determined in the accounting policy part (d) of this note. As the Company is able to determine the timing of payments of the subsidiaries' balances when they are payable, the Company considers the amount payable to be in default when the subsidiaries are not able to pay when demanded. The Company considers a subsidiary's balances to be impaired when the subsidiary is:

- unlikely to repay its payables to the Company in full;  
- having prolonged negative operating cash flows and is in net tangible liabilities position; or  
- a dormant entity or has a history of default.

At the end of the financial year, there was no indication that the amounts due from the subsidiaries are not recoverable other than those which have already been impaired. The Company does not specifically monitor the ageing of advances to the subsidiaries.

During the financial year, there has been reversal of loss allowances due to repayments received from subsidiaries.

Other non-trade receivables, amounts due from associates and joint ventures

Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk

Credit risk on other non-trade receivables are mainly arising from RJO debtors which are receivables from specific works requested by customers.

Credit risk also arises from sundry deposits for rental of office spaces from third parties and rental receivables. The Company manages the credit risk together with the specific leasing arrangements.

Staff advances and staff loans have low credit risk as these are mostly provided to existing staff. These balances are managed on a monthly basis.

Amounts due from associates and joint ventures are mostly due to transactions within the Group and have a low credit risk. These balances are managed on a monthly basis.

Exposure to credit risk, credit quality and collateral

At the end of the financial year, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by their carrying amounts in the SOFP.

The Company receives down payments, LOUs or indents for RJO debtors where works are requested by customers. In cases of RJO debtors arising from accidental damages to the Company's assets whereby the third party is identifiable, these amounts are fully impaired as there is very low prospect of recovery.

The Company receives deposits from third parties for rental of office spaces.

For staff loans and staff advances, any repayment is done through monthly payroll deductions.

(iv) Financial guarantees

Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk

The Company provides financial guarantees to banks in respect of banking facilities granted to certain subsidiaries and an associate. The Company monitors the ability of the subsidiaries and the associate to service their loans on an individual basis annually.

Impairment losses

The Company assumes that there is a significant increase in credit risk when a subsidiary or associate has indication of defaulting on its banking facilities. The Company considers a financial guarantee to be credit impaired when the subsidiary or associate is unlikely to repay its credit obligation to the bank in full.

The Company determines the probability of default of the guaranteed loans individually using internal information available.

Loss allowance has been recognised mainly arising from the financial guarantee provided by the Group in 2016 to support the loan facility offered to Iç Anadolu Dogalgaz Elektrik Üretim ve Ticaret A.§. ('ICAN'), a subsidiary of Gama Enerji Anonim Şirketi ('Gama Enerji'). The ECL is determined based on an internal assessment of Gama Enerji debt servicing ability taking into account of the current adverse macroeconomic conditions in Türkiye. The impairment loss for financial guarantees for the Group and the Company are in Stage 3.

# Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group and the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group's and the Company's exposures to liquidity risk arise principally from its various payables, loans and borrowings. The Group and the Company monitor rolling forecasts of the Group's and of the Company's liquidity requirements.

As of 31 December 2023, the Company's current liabilities exceeded their current assets by RM2,120.3 million (2022: RM1,434.6 million), mainly due to consumer deposits amounting to RM7,659.6 million (2022: RM7,185.7 million).

The Company's cash flow forecast for the next 12 months takes into account the expected revenue growth rates, customer collection trends, low rate of termination of electricity account that would crystallise the entire consumer deposits above and one-off transactions. The Company expects to be able to generate sufficient internal cash flows from operations for the next 12 months from the reporting date to meet operational and financing needs as and when they fall due.

In addition, as at 31 December 2023, the Company have undrawn borrowing facilities amounting to RM14,011.4 million (2022: RM10,815.6 million) to support any cash shortfall while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn borrowing facilities at all times to ensure the Company have the financial flexibility.

Surplus cash of the Group and of the Company is invested in profit bearing current accounts, money market deposits and other instruments with appropriate maturities and sufficient liquidity level to provide sufficient headroom as determined by the cash flow forecasts and to enable the Group and the Company to discharge liabilities in the normal course of business.

Currency risk sensitivity analysis

A  $10.0\%$  strengthening of the foreign currencies against RM at the end of the financial year would have decreased post-tax profit or loss by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remained constant and ignores any impact of forecasted sales and purchases.

A  $10.0\%$  weakening of the foreign currencies against RM at the end of the financial year would have had equal but opposite effect on the above currencies to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remained constant.

Foreign currency risk for the Group and the Company which have a functional currency other than USD, JPY, EUR and GBP are not material and hence, sensitivity analysis is not presented.

(ii) Interest rate risk

The Group's and the Company's investments in fixed rate debt security and its fixed rate borrowings are not exposed to a significant risk of change in their fair values due to changes in interest rates. The Group's and the Company's variable rate borrowings are exposed to a risk of change in cash flows due to changes in interest rates. Investment in equity security and short term receivables and payables are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk.

<table><tr><td rowspan="3"></td><td colspan="2">Group</td><td colspan="2">Company</td></tr><tr><td>2023</td><td>2022</td><td>2023</td><td>2022</td></tr><tr><td>RM&#x27;million</td><td>RM&#x27;million</td><td>RM&#x27;million</td><td>RM&#x27;million</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed rate instruments:</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Financial assets</td><td>16,182.5</td><td>2,890.0</td><td>13,297.2</td><td>923.6</td></tr><tr><td>Financial liabilities</td><td>88,498.4</td><td>95,678.8</td><td>98,964.7</td><td>110,037.0</td></tr><tr><td>Floating rate instrument:</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Financial liabilities</td><td>4,132.7</td><td>1,481.8</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr></table>

The financial assets are not sensitive to interest rate changes.

A  $5.0\%$  change in the interest rates of the financial liabilities with floating interest rates at the end of the financial year would have affected the Group's and the Company's profit or loss and equity by RM0.7 million (2022: RM0.1 million). This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates remained constant.

(iii) Other price risk

Other price risk arises from the Group's and the Company's investments in equity security, debt security and unit trust funds.

Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk

The Group and the Company are exposed to price risk because the investments held are classified on the statement of financial position as FVOCI and FVTPL. The Group and the Company mainly invest in unit trust funds, primarily in short term deposits as underlying instruments with minimal price risk.

Fair value of financial instruments

The carrying amounts of deposits, bank and cash balances, short term receivables and payables, short term borrowings, short term amount due from/(to) subsidiaries and short term derivative financial instruments approximate their fair values and are equivalent to nominal values due to the relatively short term nature of these financial instruments.

The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value and those not carried at fair value for which fair value is disclosed, together with their fair values and carrying amounts shown in the statement of financial position.

# 45 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)

(b) Financial risk management (continued)

Fair value of financial instruments (continued)

(i) Policy on transfer between levels

The fair value of an asset to be transferred between levels is determined as of the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.

There were no transfers between levels during the financial year.

(ii) Level 1 fair value

Level 1 fair value is derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.

(iii) Level 2 fair value

Level 2 fair value is estimated using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the financial assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly.

Derivative financial instruments

The fair value is estimated by the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract.

Non-derivative financial instruments

Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purpose, is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the end of the reporting period.

(iv) Level 3 fair value

Level 3 fair values for the financial assets and liabilities are estimated using unobservable inputs.

(v) Interest rates used to determine fair value

The interest rates used to discount estimated cash flows, when applicable, ranging between  $0.1\%$  to  $8.0\%$  (2022:  $0.1\%$  to  $8.0\%$ ).

Although the Group and the Company believe that their estimates of fair value are appropriate, the use of different methodologies or assumptions could lead to different measurements of fair value.

The favourable and unfavourable effects of using reasonably possible alternative assumptions have been calculated by recalibrating the model values using expected cash flows and risk-adjusted discount rates based on the probability weighted average of the Group's and of the Company's ranges of possible outcomes.

# 46 CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT

The Group's and the Company's main objective of capital management is to safeguard the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders. The Group and the Company will also strive to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

For the purpose of sustaining or changing the capital structure, the Group and the Company may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, issue new shares or return capital to shareholders.

In order to be consistent with industry norms, the Group and the Company monitor its capital structure on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as total borrowings divided by capital employed. Total borrowings include non-current borrowings and current borrowings as shown in the consolidated statement of financial position. Capital employed is the summation of total equity and total borrowings.

# 47 RESTatement

(a) Financial assets at FVOCI

During the year, the Group and the Company changed the presentation of the fair value changes of financial assets measured at FVOCI as 'Items that will not be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss' within the statements of comprehensive income from 'Items that maybe reclassified subsequently to profit or loss' previously. There is no change to OCI or total comprehensive income for the Group and the Company.

(b) Reclassification for deposits maturing more than 90 days

The Group also changed the classification of the cash flows relating to placements and withdrawals of deposits maturing more than 90 days from the date of acquisition. These cash flows are separately classified as 'Cash Flows from Investing Activities' in the consolidated statement of cash flows. They were previously classified as 'Cash Flows from Financing Activities'. The change had no impact on the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents during the year or the total cash and cash equivalents balance.

The following table shows the adjustments for each individual line item. Line items that were not affected by the changes have not been included.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To The Members of Tenaga Nasional Berhad (Incorporated In Malaysia) (Registration No. 199001009294 (200866-W))

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Our opinion

In our opinion, the financial statements of Tenaga Nasional Berhad ("the Company") and its subsidiaries ("the Group") give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and of the Company as at 31 December 2023, and of their financial performance and their cash flows for the financial year then ended in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.

What we have audited

We have audited the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, which comprise the statements of financial position as at 31 December 2023 of the Group and of the Company, and the statements of profit or loss, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows of the Group and of the Company for the financial year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, comprising material accounting policies and other explanatory information, as set out on pages 202 to 362.

Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the "Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements" section of our report.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Independence and other ethical responsibilities

We are independent of the Group and of the Company in accordance with the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, Conduct and Practice) of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants ("By-Laws") and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) ("IESBA Code"), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the By-Laws and the IESBA Code.

Our audit approach

As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company. In particular, we considered where the Directors made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters, consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.

We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and of the Company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group and the Company operate.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To The Members of Tenaga Nasional Berhad (Incorporated In Malaysia) (Registration No. 199001009294 (200866-W))

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

# Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

# Key audit matters

# Revenue recognition for sales of electricity

Refer to Note 31 - Revenue

Sales of electricity of RM51,713.2 million and RM48,223.3 million is the most significant component of the Group's and the Company's revenue, respectively, for the financial year ended 31 December 2023.

Revenue from sales of electricity is based on the end customers' consumption and the related tariff rates, which are governed by the Incentive Based Regulations imposed by the Energy Commission.

We focused on the revenue recognition for sales of electricity as it involves the use of complex billing and accounting systems to process large volumes of data with different tariffs based on respective customer categories and consumption.

# Reinvestment allowance ('RIA') claims

Refer to Note 4 - Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements and Note 42 - Contingent Liabilities and Material Litigations

The Inland Revenue Board ('IRB') had disallowed the Company's RIA claims for the Years of Assessment ('YAs') 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 and had issued notices of additional assessments ('Notices') to the Company, amounting in aggregate to RM7,858.6 million.

As at 31 December 2023, the Group and Company recorded a tax recoverable of RM3,522.4 million and have not recorded the potential tax liabilities of RM6,101.4 million arising from the tax impact if the RIA claims are disallowed and the Company loses its appeal. Based on the legal advice obtained from its tax solicitors on the merits of the cases, the Directors are of the opinion that no provision is required in the financial statements for the potential tax liability up to the reporting date.

We focused on this area due to the inherent uncertainties involved in the outcome of judgement on the RIA by the Special Commissioners of Income Tax and by the Kuala Lumpur High Court, including the subsequent notice of appeal filed by the IRB before the Court of Appeal.

# How our audit addressed the key audit matters

We performed the following audit procedures:

- Tested the overall information technology general controls of the billing and accounting systems recording the revenue transactions;  
- Tested the application controls within the billing systems over the following:

- maintenance of tariff rates in the billing systems;  
- accuracy of calculation of amounts billed to customers; and  
- recording of revenue transactions;

- Tested the billings and revenue adjustments on a sampling basis to assess whether the revenue recognised and revenue adjustments are valid and recorded accurately; and  
- Examined the correspondence with the Energy Commission and assessed whether there were any material matters that would affect revenue recognition.

Based on the above procedures performed, we did not find any material exceptions.

We performed the following audit procedures:

- Evaluated the Directors' assessment on the basis of recoverability of the tax recoverable of RM3,522.4 million in respect of RIA and the potential tax liabilities of RM6,101.4 million in respect of RIA by the IRB by assessing the independent legal confirmations obtained from management's external legal counsel; and  
- Examined the correspondence between the Company and the tax authority and assessed the matters in dispute based on advice from our tax experts to review the basis of applying the relevant tax laws.

Based on the procedures performed above, we did not find any material exceptions to the Directors' judgement in the treatment of the tax recoverable balance and the potential tax liabilities.

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Key audit matters (continued)

# Key audit matters

# Assessment on carrying value of post-employment benefits

Refer to Note 4 - Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements and Note 24 - Employee Benefits

As at 31 December 2023, the Group recorded post-employment benefit asset of RM147.1 million and post-employment benefit liabilities of RM12,371.1 million while the Company recorded post-employment benefit asset of RM147.1 million and post-employment benefit liabilities of RM11,613.7 million.

Management assessed the present value of post-employment benefit plans by relying on the actuarial valuation reports from an actuary. The actuarial valuation reports estimated the present value of post-employment benefit plans based on key assumptions that comprised expected rate of salary increases, medical cost inflation and discount rates.

We focused on this area because of the significant estimates made by management in determining the present value of post-employment benefit plans.

# Business Combination - Acquisitions during the financial year

Refer to Note 4 - Critical Accounting Estimates and Significant Judgements, Note 10 - Intangible Assets and Note 48 - Significant Acquisitions during Current and Preceding Financial Years

Acquisition of Spark Renewables Pty Ltd and its subsidiaries ('Spark Renewables Group')

On 20 September 2023, the Group completed its acquisition of  $100\%$  equity interest in the Spark Renewables Group for a purchase consideration of RM1,184.9 million. The Group assessed the acquisition of these subsidiaries as a business acquisition in accordance with MFRS 3 "Business Combinations".

Based on the purchase price allocation ('PPA') exercise performed, the fair value of identifiable net assets recognised on the date of acquisition was RM852.5 million, of which RM325.2 million relates to fair value adjustments. The provisional goodwill recognised amounted to RM332.4 million.

# How our audit addressed the key audit matters

We performed the following audit procedures:

- Obtained an understanding of the terms and conditions of the post-employment benefit plans; and  
- Tested the present value of post-employment benefit plans based on the actuarial valuation reports by performing the following:

- Discussed with the actuary on the valuation method used and checked that the valuation method is acceptable in accordance with MFRS 119 "Employee Benefits";  
- Discussed with the actuary on the key assumptions used in the actuarial valuation and checked the reasonableness by comparing to historical data;  
- Checked the reasonableness of the discount rates with the assistance of our valuation experts by comparing to market yields of high quality government securities at the reporting date;  
- Checked the membership data used in the actuarial models through inspection of payroll personnel files and other supporting documents; and  
- Compared the fair value of plan assets based on the actuary report against the trustee's report.

Based on the procedures performed above, we did not find any material exceptions to the Directors' estimates of the post-employment benefits carrying value.

Acquisition of Spark Renewables Group

We performed the following audit procedures:

- Agreed purchase consideration to the share sale agreement;  
- Obtained and discussed the PPA report prepared by an external party for the acquisition to assess the appropriateness of the identification of assets acquired and liabilities assumed;  
- Assessed the appropriateness of key assumptions, in particular, asset useful life, plant performance, electricity prices and operating expenses, used in the underlying cash flows projections adopted in the PPA exercise by comparing these assumptions against due diligence reports, existing agreements and market outlook;  
- Engaged our internal valuation experts to perform the following:

- assess the appropriateness of the methodology adopted by management in determining the fair value of the identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed in accordance with MFRS 13 "Fair Value Measurement";  
- assess the reasonableness of valuation of the intangible assets acquired by way of benchmarking precedent market transactions involving companies in a similar industry and recomputation based on independent market data; and  
- assess the reasonableness of the discount rate used in the underlying cash flow projections;

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

# Key audit matters

Business Combination - Acquisitions during the financial year (continued)

# Acquisitions of Dullarbtons Limited and Elipsgeen Limited

On 20 December 2023, the Group completed its acquisitions of  $100\%$  equity interests in both Dullarbtons Limited and Elipsgeen Limited for a purchase consideration of RM494.0 million. The Group assessed the acquisitions of these subsidiaries as a business acquisition in accordance with MFRS 3 "Business Combinations".

Based on the PPA exercise performed, the fair value of identifiable net assets recognised on the date of acquisition was RM335.3 million, of which RM84.6 million relates to fair value adjustments. The provisional goodwill recognised amounted to RM158.7 million.

We focused on this area because the determination of fair values in the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including the identification of intangible assets, requires significant judgement in estimating the underlying assumptions to be applied.

# How our audit addressed the key audit matters

Acquisition of Spark Renewables Group (continued)

We performed the following audit procedures: (continued)

- Checked the calculation of the provisional goodwill arising from the acquisition, being the difference between the total purchase consideration and the provisional fair values of identification net assets acquired; and  
- Assessed the adequacy and appropriateness of the disclosures relating to the acquisition in the Group's consolidated financial statements.

# Acquisitions of Dullarbtons Limited and Elipsgeen Limited

We performed the following audit procedures:

- Agreed purchase consideration to the share purchase agreements;  
- Assessed the appropriateness of key assumptions, in particular, asset useful lives, electricity prices and operating expenses, used in the underlying cash flows projections adopted in the PPA exercise by comparing these assumptions against due diligence reports, existing agreements and market outlook;  
- Engaged our internal valuation experts to perform the following:

- assess the appropriateness of the methodology adopted by management in determining the fair value of the identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed in accordance with MFRS 13 "Fair Value Measurement"; and  
- assess the reasonableness of the discount rates used in the underlying cash flow projections;  
- Checked the calculation of the provisional goodwill arising from the acquisition, being the difference between the total purchase consideration and the provisional fair values of identification net assets acquired; and  
- Assessed the adequacy and appropriateness of the disclosures relating to the acquisitions in the Group's consolidated financial statements.

Based on the procedures performed above, we did not find any material exceptions to the Directors' judgements with respect to the key assumptions applied to the PPA exercises of the acquisitions.

Information other than the financial statements and auditors' report thereon

The Directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Directors' Report and the Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control, which we obtained prior to the date of this auditors' report, and other sections of the TNB Integrated Annual Report 2023, which is expected to be made available to us after that date. Other information does not include the financial statements of the Group and of the Company and our auditors' report thereon.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To The Members of Tenaga Nasional Berhad (Incorporated In Malaysia) (Registration No. 199001009294 (200866-W))

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Information other than the financial statements and auditors' report thereon (continued)

Our opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditors' report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements

The Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company that give a true and fair view in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

# Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

(a) Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.  
(b) Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's and of the Company's internal control.  
(c) Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors.  
(d) Conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's or on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements (continued)

(e) Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.  
(f) Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements of the Group. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

From the matters communicated with the Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

In accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia, we report that the subsidiaries of which we have not acted as auditors, are disclosed in Note 49 to the financial statements.

# OTHER MATTERS

This report is made solely to the members of the Company, as a body, in accordance with Section 266 of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility to any other person for the content of this report.

# NOTICE OF THE  $34^{\text{TH}}$  ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING

The last increment of the Non-Executive Directors remuneration/benefits payable was made in 2013. The Board in 2023 engaged an independent expert to undertake the Non-Executive Directors' Remuneration Benchmarking exercise. Based on the findings, the structure of Non-Executive Directors' remuneration (including benefits) was generally aligned with the market practice and the Board/BNRC agreed to retain the existing Non-Executive Directors' remuneration and it is to be reviewed in three (3) years' time.

For the proposed Ordinary Resolution 19, as Muazzam bin Mohamad, Non-Independent Non-Executive Director was appointed with effect from 1 July 2023 of which after the  $33^{\mathrm{rd}}$  AGM of the Company, therefore, the approval of the payment of Director's fee since his appointment until the  $34^{\mathrm{th}}$  AGM shall be sought at this AGM.

The proposed Ordinary Resolutions 8 to 18 for the payment of Directors' fees and benefits payable to the Non-Executive Directors of the Company from the  $34^{\text{th}}$  AGM until the conclusion of the next AGM are tabled herewith in line with the provision of the Act and Guidance 7.2 of the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance 2021 to ensure full disclosure.

The Non-Executive Directors remuneration policy of TNB and its subsidiaries is as follows:

* subject to not more than three (3) payments in a month.  
save for TNB Non-Executive Chairman, none of TNB Non-Executive Directors are currently on the board of TNB subsidiaries.

In determining the estimated total amount of benefits payable, the Board had considered various factors including the number of scheduled and special meetings for the Board, Board Committees and boards of subsidiaries along with the number of Non-Executive Directors involved.

Payment of Non-Executive Directors' benefits will be made by the Company and its subsidiaries on a monthly basis and/or as and when incurred, provided that the proposed Ordinary Resolution 18 be passed at the  $34^{\text{th}}$  AGM. The Board is of the view that it is fair and justifiable for the payment of benefits to the Non-Executive Directors be made as and when incurred, after the Non-Executive Directors have discharged their responsibilities and rendered their services to the Company.

Details of the Directors' Remuneration for the Financial Year ended 31 December 2023 are enumerated on page 163 of the Corporate Governance Overview Statement of this Integrated Annual Report.

# (d) Ordinary Resolution 20 - Re-appointment of Auditors
