# Chairman's Letter to Shareholders

# OVERVIEW

The year 2024 was one of both challenges and opportunities on the global and local scale. Global supply chains continued to be affected by ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Eastern Europe together with trade tensions, especially between the United States (US) and China. Against a background of elections in major economies such as the US, India and the European Union, financial markets were volatile and there was a push for de-dollarisation, with some countries reducing their reliance on the US dollar in trade.

Global real GDP growth registered at  $3.3\%$  in 2023 and is projected to moderate slightly to record  $3.2\%$  in 2024. At the same time, inflation declined in many countries but remained a concern due to persistent supply chain issues and energy price fluctuations. Amid this backdrop, the world continued to witness various extreme weather events, further driving decarbonisation efforts. Investments in renewable energy (RE) technologies and infrastructure are increasing while more governments have started to implement carbon pricing and stricter emissions regulations.

Despite the external headwinds, economic growth in Malaysia was robust, at  $5.1\%$ , as compared to  $3.6\%$  in 2023. This was primarily due to continued expansion in domestic demand and a rebound in exports. The government's continued focus on sustainable development, as outlined in the National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR) and the Twelfth Malaysia Plan (12MP), served as further impetus for growth, with projects under national master plans attracting significant domestic and foreign investments.

The New Industrial Master Plan, which aims to position the country as a digitally connected nation with extensive and reliable digital infrastructure, has been particularly effective – especially in promoting data centre expansion. In 2024, 18 data centres were commissioned under the Green Lane Pathway, increasing energy demand by 1.9GW. Overall electricity demand led to a  $6.5\%$  increase in electricity sales compared to  $3.9\%$  in 2023, driving a  $6.9\%$  growth in TNB Group's revenue.

# STRONG FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

Against a backdrop of increased demand and high operational efficiency, TNB recorded strong revenue growth and an  $18.5\%$  increase in Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) to RM8.72 billion from RM7.36 billion in 2023. Based on our earnings, the Board declared a total dividend of 51.0 sen per share—the highest in four years—amounting to RM2.96 billion, or  $59.6\%$  of the Group's Adjusted Profit After Tax and Minority Interest (PATAMI). This payout, made in conjunction with our  $75^{\text{th}}$  anniversary, is at the upper end of our dividend policy range of  $30\%$  to  $60\%$ . Indeed, we have consistently adhered to this policy, demonstrating TNB's commitment to providing attractive returns to our shareholders.

In addition to healthy dividends, we also distributed RM1.09 billion in taxation and zakat, benefiting the rakyat and nation. Of note, we were able to create financial value for our stakeholders while also utilising RM8 billion in approved Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) (including an energy transition CAPEX of RM3.2 billion). The latter encompassed the installation of 949,226 units of smart meters in 2024 to further empower our consumers in managing their energy consumption.

TNB's excellent financial performance, coupled with the  $1.8\%$  decline in overall receivables, contributed to improved credit ratings to "AAA" by Rating Agency Malaysia (RAM) and Malaysian Rating Corporation Berhad (MARC), "A3" by Moody's Corporation (Moody's), and "A-” by S&P Global.

# A 75-YEAR LEGACY OF POWERING THE NATION

In commemorating a milestone such as our  $75^{\text {th }}$  anniversary, it is only natural that we reflect on our journey over the years. It is truly heartwarming to be reminded of how, since our inception in 1949, LLN/TNB has been at the epicentre of Malaysia's progress, playing a pivotal role in the nation's economic transformation.

Over the past 75 years, we have evolved from a small electricity department into one of the largest utility companies in Southeast Asia, with a diversified portfolio that spans generation, transmission, distribution and retail. From pioneering RE projects to enhancing grid reliability and capacity, TNB has consistently provided world-class services and maintained a resilient energy supply system.

In addition, through the consistently high dividends paid to our shareholders – primarily Government-Linked Investment Companies (GLICs) such as Permodalan Nasional Berhad, Khazanah Nasional, Employees Provident Fund, Kumpulan Wang Persaraan (Diperbadankan) and Lembaga Tabung Haji – we have been contributing to the rakyat through pension funds and indirectly to support overall economic development. TNB itself has gone beyond our core business to provide affordable energy solutions via initiatives such as our Village Street Lighting Programme in close collaboration with the Government. Since its launch in 2000, we have installed more than half a million streetlights in rural areas. By 2024, we had entered Phase 11 of the programme, and had put up another 14,210 energy-efficient LED lights, funded under the 12MP.

# FRONTRUNNER IN THE ENERGY TRANSITION

Given the urgency to manage and mitigate climate change, a key government agenda today is to minimise the national carbon footprint with the ultimate objective of achieving net zero emissions. This is the thrust of the NETR, launched in 2023, which focuses on increasing RE to  $70\%$  of the country's total generation capacity by 2050.

I'm pleased to share that TNB is a key player in the country's energy transition as we spearhead three flagship projects under NETR, namely Centralised Solar Parks (CSPs), hybrid hydro-floating solar (HHFS), and co-firing hydrogen and ammonia projects. On top of that, it is with even greater pleasure to share that we have recorded other key wins including securing 500MW (686MWp) capacity under the government's Large Scale Solar 5 (LSS5) project in Kedah while making positive inroads into the energy transition in Sabah. This is being realised through the 15MW (23MWp) LSS Sabah project and the 400MWh battery storage project in Lahad Datu, which is set to be the largest in ASEAN to date, and amongst the first in Malaysia.

At the same time, we are driving the RE agenda in collaboration with various partners. We are working with PETRONAS to advance the hydrogen business in Malaysia and explore carbon capture and storage (CCS) opportunities for gas-fired plants. We have also partnered with Sime Darby Property on the installation of rooftop solar on its housing development projects; and are engaging with BHPetrol as well as Petron on the development and expansion of charging stations for electric vehicles (EVs). We currently have 66 EV charging stations installed nationwide and have set the target of increasing the number to 250 by the end of 2025. Meanwhile, it is good to see that increased access to EV charging stations is contributing to more battery EVs on the road, with the number standing at 37,300 units at end of 2024.

# CHAIRMAN'S LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

Meanwhile, TNB is also propelling Malaysia's rapid expansion in the global RE market with the launch of the 102MW Solar Greenfield Development in the United Kingdom (UK), which presents an opportunity for TNB to learn and share our experience in RE.

# REGIONAL ENERGY HUB

At the regional level, we continue to entrench our position as a key player in the ASEAN Power Grid, committed to advancing energy security and leading the region's energy transition. In September 2024, we signed a 100MW cross-border deal with Singapore's Keppel Electric as part of the Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project (LTMS-PIP). This was followed by a partnership in December with leading Singaporean renewables player Sembcorp Power for a maiden 50MW cross-border RE trade via Energy Exchange Malaysia (ENEGEM). This will certainly be a focus area in 2025 onwards when Malaysia assumes the role as the Chair of ASEAN.

# SUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITIES

TNB has a tradition of contributing towards the upliftment of society through zakat and corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives that empower people and drive sustainable growth. Starting out as a government agency, community empowerment is part of our DNA, focusing on education, sports, community well-being and the environment. In 2024, we distributed RM33 million in zakat, while allocating a total of RM63 million to CSR projects.

Empowering future generations through education support by Yayasan Tenaga Nasional.

Under the education pillar, as at December 2024, our foundation Yayasan Tenaga Nasional (YTN) has sponsored 1,582 students with an investment of RM42.6 million. Since its establishment over 30 years ago, YTN has allocated over RM1.8 billion to support the education and welfare of 20,700 students. Today, as we champion the country's energy transition, we are proud to collaborate with Universiti Tenaga Nasional (UNITEN) to launch the TNB Energy Transition Academy, where the focus is on developing human capital equipped to tackle future energy challenges. Meanwhile, in collaboration with the Government and Energy Commission, we continue to educate the public on energy systems, consumption patterns and sustainability via our Malaysia Energy Literacy Programme (MELP) which promotes informed decision-making and responsible energy use.

Sports is another area in which TNB has contributed significant resources since the 1970s, especially hockey where we have trained and sponsored many world-class national players. At the heart of our hockey initiatives is the TNB Thunderbolts programme, aimed at developing young players aged between 13 and 17 years to become future stars. In 2024 itself, nearly RM6 million was allocated for the Malaysian Hockey Confederation, TNB Thunderbolts and hockey clinics.

Meanwhile, we support socio-economic development via various programmes. Among our flagship initiatives are Program Baiti Jannati and Projek Mesra Rakyat through which we rebuild, repair or purchase homes for vulnerable groups. Since 2018, we have channelled RM40.2 million to these programmes, benefitting close to 1,000 families. We also provide support to communities surrounding our power generation projects. In recent years, we have extended substantial aid to the Orang Asli communities neighbouring the Nenggiri hydro project, providing farming and other income generating opportunities to more than 1,200 individuals.

In the environmental sphere, our efforts centre around decarbonisation such as tree planting and installing energy efficient lights for non-profit organisations as well as in underserved areas.

# ESG EXCELLENCE

Our environmental and social programmes are underpinned by strong corporate governance; and all three (3) environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles are deeply embedded in our corporate strategy, ensuring responsible business practices that benefit all stakeholders.

In 2024, we achieved a significant milestone with the establishment of the TNB Sustainability Framework comprising 14 key focus areas and setting out our sustainability commitments, including the aspiration to achieve Net Zero by 2050. Towards Net Zero, we seek to reduce, capture and offset our carbon emissions as per our Carbon Management Strategy. To keep track of our progress, we are monitoring and disclosing our Scopes 1, 2 and 3 emissions in our Sustainability Report.

In addition to the Sustainability Framework, in 2024 we also developed and launched our Biodiversity Framework outlining our aspiration and guiding principles in support of Malaysia's National Policy on Biological Diversity and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KMGBF). This new framework provides structure for project-specific initiatives we have already been implementing over the years. For example, as part of the Nenggiri hydroelectric project, we have created a nursery to grow native plant species for habitat rehabilitation and enrichment. We have also established various wildlife corridors and designated grazing zones to facilitate safe animal movements and minimise human-wildlife conflicts.

Meanwhile, we are proud to become the first electricity utility player in ASEAN to establish a Transition Finance Framework, which provides transparency in terms of the processes employed by TNB in undertaking sustainable finance transactions (SFTs) to fund projects that support our decarbonisation and energy transition efforts.

With regard to integrity and accountability, we achieved  $100 \%$ compliance with Adequate Procedures on Corporate Liability under Section 17A of the Malaysian Anti- Corruption Commission (MACC) Act 2009. In addition,

# TNB remains dedicated to leading Malaysia's energy transition while ensuring long-term value creation for our shareholders.

a total of 34,653 employees and 1,237 vendors have successfully completed anti-corruption training.

The fact that TNB's MSCI ESG Rating has been upgraded from "BBB" to "A" validates all our efforts and demonstrates that we are on the right track to becoming a sustainability-driven organisation.

# OUTLOOK

The global economy is expected to grow at a moderate pace in 2025, with advanced economies facing slower growth due to tighter monetary policies, geopolitical uncertainties, and trade tensions. Meanwhile, efforts to combat climate change will accelerate, with increased investments in RE, energy efficiency and decarbonisation technologies.

In Malaysia, the outlook remains resilient, with GDP growth projected at  $4.5\% - 5.5\%$  supported by strong domestic demand, private sector investment, and conducive government fiscal policies. The implementation of 12MP and NETR will support sustainable economic growth and the country's energy transition.

The energy sector itself will face continued volatility in global oil and gas prices due to geopolitical tensions, supply-demand imbalances, and OPEC+ production decisions. In contrast, coal prices stabilised in 2024 and are expected to remain steady moving forward.

At TNB, we are very thankful for the successful Incentive-Based Regulation (IBR) Regulatory Period 4 (RP4) outcome, which testifies to the government's commitment to the IBR framework. With a maintained Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) of  $7.3\%$  and CAPEX of RM42.8 billion (including contingent CAPEX), this is set to stimulate the nation's economy and prepare the electricity network to facilitate the nation's energy transition. Through RP4 implementation, TNB commits to ensure a reliable and continuous supply of electricity to our customers, enhance our customer service level and facilitating the nation's energy transition agenda.

# ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

TNB's journey over the last seven (7) decades has been extremely commendable. While the team deserves to be acknowledged for shaping the organisation into the next-generation utility player it is today, we have also received unrelenting support from various stakeholders, particularly the Malaysian Government, our regulator, our shareholders and investors, our partners, and all our customers. On behalf of the Board, I would like to express my gratitude to these key stakeholders, as well as to our highly capable Management and the thousands of employees who often go beyond the call of duty to maintain security and reliability of supply.

As we look to the future, TNB remains dedicated to leading Malaysia's energy transition while ensuring long-term value creation for our shareholders. Our roadmap for 2025 and beyond includes further investments in RE, energy storage and smart grid infrastructure to solidify our position as a sustainable energy leader in the region. We are confident that, with the support of our employees and other stakeholders, TNB will continue to thrive in an evolving energy landscape.

# STRATEGY FOR ENERGY TRANSITION

At TNB, we are aligned to Malaysia's energy transition and climate goals set in the National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR). In 2024, we embarked on a refreshed corporate strategy, Reimagining TNB 2.0, which outlines our focus to enable the nation's decarbonisation and energy transition journey.

Our corporate strategy is anchored on four (4) strategic pillars: Deliver Clean Generation; Develop The Energy Transition Network; Offer Dynamic Energy Solutions and Drive Regulatory Evolution.

Subsequently, our strategic pillars are underpinned by five (5) enablers: Capital Allocation and Value Creation; Corporate Structure, Governance and Partnerships; Communication and Stakeholder Engagement; Digitalisation; and Talent, Capabilities and Culture.

# ESG HIGHLIGHTS

While achieving notable successes within our operations, it gives me pleasure to share that we have also made significant advances in our sustainability space. In 2024, we rolled out a new Sustainability Framework with 14 key areas and introduced policies covering biodiversity, labour rights, and transition finance. I'm especially proud that TNB is the first utility in ASEAN to launch a Transition Finance Framework — a noteworthy step in supporting our energy transition with the right funding approach.

As a result of these key developments, I am delighted to share that our MSCI ESG rating soared from "BBB" to "A", with key gains in areas like carbon emissions, water use, and renewables. We concurrently improved our FTSE Russell score, thanks to better performance in both environmental and social indicators including to health and safety.

On another note, our TNB Platinum headquarters also received recognition for Gold at The Edge's Best Managed & Sustainable Property Awards 2024.

Most importantly, we continue to keep our 34,939 employees safe, as aptly shown from steadily improving safety targets. Indeed, safety should never be taken for granted, and we will keep working to make safety part of our culture.

# PAT increased by 81.7% to RM4.73 billion

# Our market cap grew by 49.5% from RM58.1 billion as at end 2023 to RM86.9 billion at end 2024

# DELIVER CLEAN GENERATION

To date, TNB currently has 3.3GW of renewable energy (RE) in Peninsular Malaysia and 1.1GW abroad, mainly in the UK, Ireland and Australia.

In 2024, we secured over 700MWp of solar projects in large solar capacity through Large Scale Solar 5 (LSS5) and LSS Sabah. In addition, we achieved financial close for a 45MWp solar plant in Kulim under the Corporate Green Power Programme (CGPP).

2024 Internationally, we operate a combined capacity of 927MW comprising of solar and wind assets in the UK, Ireland and Australia, and as well as commenced construction of two (2) new solar farms in the UK, totalling 102MWp and wind under development of 120MW.

Under the NETR, we are making progress on three (3) flagship projects, namely Centralised Solar Parks (CSPs), hybrid hydro-floating solar (HHFS), and co-firing hydrogen and ammonia projects. Allow me to share on the progress of these projects.

On HHFS, there is a 2.5GW floating solar photovoltaic development across our hydro reservoirs. This includes a successful installation of 154kWp at our own Kenyir Dam.

For CSPs, we are developing five (5) 150MWp solar parks across Malaysia with local partners. Currently, we have secured to supply 150MWp of green energy to Bridge Data Centres via Corporate Renewable Energy Supply Scheme (CRESS).

In addition, we are also working with PETRONAS on green hydrogen using solar power from our Kenyir project. A pilot system is currently in place with 500kWp solar panels and 1MWh battery storage.

Notable domestic RE projects being undertaken by TNB include the 300MW Nenggiri hydro project in Kelantan which has achieved  $48\%$  completion.

# DEVELOP ENERGY TRANSITION NETWORK

TNB is supporting the country's energy transition by upgrading the existing electricity network, ensuring security of supply. In December 2024, we completed the monopole transmission tower project in Penang, enabling 2,000MVA of power transferred to the island.

Regionally, we are also securing RE supply at the regional level by facilitating trade with neighbouring countries. These include exporting RE to Singapore through Keppel Electric under the Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project (LTMS-PIP). Concurrently we signed a 50MW green energy supply deal with Sembcorp in December.

To support the growing data centre industry, we successfully rolled-out a Green Lane Pathway with a 12-month delivery guarantee and a dedicated One Stop Centre support team. By the end of 2024, 18 data centres were energised, and 38 supply agreements secured, totaling 5.9GW.

On enabling the smart lifestyles of our customers, we have installed over 4.5 million of smart meters in the homes of our customers. These customers can now enjoy more control and empowerment through information on daily consumption and subsequently enjoy other features offered in myTNB App, enabled by smart meters.

# DYNAMIC ENERGY SOLUTIONS

Through our own solar arm, GSPARX Sdn Bhd (GSPARX), we have successfully secured over 500MW of solar capacity across Peninsular Malaysia. Major development includes projects with Sime Darby Property in Elmina and Bandar Bukit Raja with solar panels installed in their residential, sales galleries, malls, and clubhouses. At these developments there are also customers living in solar-powered homes with the option to sell excess electricity back to the grid.

TNB is actively supporting the energy transition by advancing electric mobility initiatives. At the end of 2024, 66 TNB Electron chargers have been installed, with a target to expand this network to 250 chargers by 2025. We launched our first 200kW fast-charging station in collaboration with BHPetrol and have strengthened partnerships with Petron to further develop the EV ecosystem.

As part of our internal decarbonisation efforts, we are committed to electrifying  $30\%$  of our operational fleet by 2030, representing over 1,000 vehicles. To support the broader EV charging landscape, we introduced the EV Green Lane in 2022 - a streamlined facilitation platform that has received over 360 applications from charge point operators to date.

I am pleased to say that we also made headway in renewable energy certificates (RECs) space via our subsidiary, TNBX Sdn. Bhd.'s platform named Malaysia Green Attribute Trading System (mGATS). To date, a sum of 1,100GWh of green energy was opened for commercial trading - boosting corporate access to clean energy.

# DRIVE REGULATORY EVOLUTION

TNB is appreciative of the government's steadfast support in the growth and development of the energy industry. We strive to maintain open dialogue and engagement on energy and electricity-based matters. Among others, we worked on the Incentive-Based Regulation (IBR) framework, which enters its fourth period - the IBR Regulatory Period 4 (RP4) in January 2025.

The previous IBR RP3 cycle saw fruitful accomplishments, including RM23.6 billion in CAPEX on projects that strengthen the nation's energy security, reliability and sustainability. This has

subsequently charted the next phase of projects in RP4 that will meet rising demand in the energy transition agenda and strengthen long-term energy agenda.

As a core driver of Malaysia's energy transition, we are honored to represent the nation at global climate forums like the  $29^{\text{th}}$  United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP29), and actively contribute to local policy-making. Contributions include input on key bills such as the Energy Efficiency Act, CCUS Bill, and proposed Climate Change Bill.

We also support national reforms through MyPower Corp and recently signed an Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the state government and industry players to explore new energy projects in the state.

Looking ahead, we are committed to working closely with policymakers to ensure the regulatory landscape supports decarbonisation, energy access, and investor confidence.

# OUTLOOK

Going forward, we are optimistic about 2025, with economic growth projected at  $4.5\% - 5.5\%$  and electricity demand rising up to  $4.5\%$ . With the launch of RP4 and a promising  $7.3\%$  return on investment, we are provided with strong confidence to scale up.

Taking into consideration the infrastructure that will have to be built to support the country's energy transition, the budgeted CAPEX has been more than doubled to RM42.8 billion comprising

# Trade-Offs

TNB strategically balances reinvestment and shareholder returns to sustain financial strength. While energy transition investments may impact short-term returns, they unlock long-term value, support business resilience, and enable scalable clean energy solutions aligned with national policy and global decarbonisation goals.

TNB prioritises infrastructure modernisation and reliability upgrades to enhance long-term system efficiency and grid resilience. While this requires upfront CAPEX, it ensures sustainable service delivery, supports renewable integration, and positions TNB for future-ready operations.

Strategic workforce transformation through upskilling, diversity, and safety excellence ensures long-term capability and engagement. While reskilling and organisational restructuring require ongoing investment, they enhance talent agility and drive a high-performance culture aligned with the Group's energy transition goals.

TNB channels resources into research and development, and digital innovation to accelerate decarbonisation and operational excellence. This forward investment may trade off short-term gains but enables long-term competitive advantage, technological leadership, and value creation across the energy ecosystem.

TNB fosters trust with stakeholders through inclusive programmes and transparent engagement. While expanding stakeholder programmes requires time and resources, it strengthens the licence to operate, deepens partnerships, and enables just transition outcomes for communities and customers alike.

In reducing environmental impact and enhancing stewardship of natural resources, TNB invests in cleaner energy and efficient practices. These actions may involve trade-offs with legacy assets but are vital for long-term sustainability and aligning with national and global climate ambitions.

# Operating Landscape

# The Market Landscape

In 2024, Malaysia's energy sector underwent significant transformations, driven by economic recovery, policy advancements, technological innovations and a steadfast commitment to sustainability. Electricity demand in Peninsular Malaysia continued its upward trajectory, recording  $6.5\%$  year-on-year growth for the year, primarily fueled by industrial sector recovery and the burgeoning digital economy.

# NAVIGATING UNCERTAINTY IN ENERGY ENVIRONMENT

The global energy market in 2024 was marked by fluctuating coal prices, which moderated from previous highs but remained volatile, reflecting the ongoing variability in fossil fuel markets. This volatility posed challenges to electricity tariff management. In response, the Malaysian government maintained the Imbalance Cost Pass-Through (ICPT) mechanism, ensuring that domestic consumers with monthly consumption up to  $600\mathrm{kWh}$  continued to receive a rebate of 2 sen/kWh.

The ICPT mechanism, implemented since January 2014 under the Incentive-Based Regulation (IBR) framework, allows Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) to adjust electricity tariffs in response to changes in fuel and generation costs. This approach ensures that fluctuations in global fuel prices are fairly reflected in consumer tariffs, maintaining transparency and financial stability within the energy sector.

# ADVANCING ENERGY TRANSITION COMMITMENTS

The launch of Malaysia's National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR) in 2023 underscored the nation's dedication to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. The roadmap sets ambitious targets, aiming for renewable energy (RE) to constitute  $70\%$  of the national installed capacity by 2050. TNB is actively contributing to these goals by investing in RE projects and modernising the grid to support a more resilient electricity network.

In line with these commitments, TNB has initiated several projects focusing on solar and hydroelectric power, leveraging Malaysia's abundant natural resources. The company is also exploring innovative solutions such as energy storage systems and smart grid technologies to enhance grid flexibility and reliability. These efforts are designed to facilitate the integration of RE sources and accommodate the evolving energy consumption patterns of consumers.

# DEMAND GROWTH AND ELECTRIFICATION OPPORTUNITIES

The higher anticipated growth in electricity demand in Peninsular Malaysia reflects the nation's economic expansion and increased electrification across various sectors. To meet this rising demand, TNB is committed to enhancing system reliability and supporting Malaysia's decarbonisation agenda through strategic investments and collaborations with stakeholders.

A significant portion of this increased demand is attributed to the rapid growth of data centres in Malaysia. Electricity demand from data centres is projected to reach 12.9GW by 2030 and 20.9GW by 2040, as mentioned by Energy Transition and Water Transformation (PETRA) Minister, Datuk Seri Fadillah Yusof on 12 December 2024, underscoring the critical need for capacity expansion and sustainable energy solutions. TNB is proactively engaging with data centre operators to develop tailored energy solutions that align with their sustainability objectives, including the provision of RE options and energy efficiency advisory services.

Moreover, TNB is exploring opportunities in the electrification of transportation, recognising the potential of electric vehicles (EVs) to contribute to energy demand growth while reducing carbon emissions. Initiatives include the development of EV charging infrastructure and collaborations with automotive industry stakeholders to promote EV adoption.

# ENHANCING GRID RESILIENCE AND MODERNISATION

To accommodate the increasing penetration of RE sources and the growing complexity of the energy landscape, TNB is investing in grid modernisation initiatives. These efforts focus on enhancing grid resilience, integrating advanced digital technologies and implementing smart grid solutions to improve operational efficiency and reliability.

TNB's grid modernisation strategy includes the deployment of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), which enables real-time monitoring and management of electricity consumption. This technology empowers consumers with greater control over their energy usage and facilitates demand-side management, contributing to overall grid stability.

Furthermore, TNB is strengthening its transmission and distribution networks to support the integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) and facilitate bi-directional energy flows.

# Strengthening Our Sustainability Governance

A strong sustainability governance and leadership structure is vital to spearhead our sustainability agenda and to provide clear and definitive guidance to achieve our Net Zero aspirations. Our sustainability governance forms a part of the TNB Governance Framework that is aligned with the principles of the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance (MCCG). The TNB Sustainability Governance Structure is in place to facilitate oversight, strategic management, and implementation of sustainability strategies and initiatives at all levels.

# Committed to Reaching Overall ESG-Related Targets with Enhanced ESG Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

In 2024, sustainability-related Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were further enhanced and embedded within the Board and senior management's performance evaluation scorecard to drive Group-wide accountability in steering our sustainability performance. Sustainability performance objectives relating to the ESG pillars are tied to the President/CEO and top management KPIs, as shown below. TNB ESG rating score includes performance and management for environmental, social, and governance including carbon emissions, water, capability development, and anti-corruption.

# TNB Materiality Assessment

Our sustainability agenda is centred around material ESG matters as outlined in our materiality matrix. To ensure our approach remains relevant and responsive to evolving trends and stakeholder expectations, we conduct a comprehensive materiality assessment every two (2) years. In 2024, we conducted a comprehensive materiality assessment, adhering to the guidelines of the Bursa Sustainability Reporting Guide (3rd Edition) which comprises of three (3) phases.

# PHASE 1: IDENTIFICATION OF STAKEHOLDERS & MATERIAL SUSTAINABILITY MATTERS

Our material sustainability matters are aligned with our strategic goals, which are the Reimagining TNB (RT) 2.0 and achieving Net Zero by 2050. We also incorporate insights from our eight key stakeholder groups to ensure that our sustainability efforts are aligned with their priorities and expectations. We also benchmark identified material sustainability matters against leading global power utilities and Government-Linked Companies.

To prioritise these material sustainability matters, weightages are accorded to each stakeholder group, reflecting their priorities and importance to TNB.

# PHASE 2: PRIORITISATION OF MATERIAL SUSTAINABILITY MATTERS

The relative importance of material matters is assessed based on two considerations:

(i) significance/magnitude of the impact of the material matter to the Company; and  
(ii) influence on the assessment and decisions of stakeholders.

To prioritise the identified material sustainability matters, we engaged in focus group discussions with employees who regularly interact with stakeholders and analysed data and feedback from engagement sessions with stakeholder groups that were conducted throughout the year.

As a result, a materiality matrix that prioritises the relative importance of each material matter to the Company and stakeholders is derived.

The materiality matrix is deliberated, reviewed, validated and approved by the following levels of authority:

PHASE 3: REVIEW AND VALIDATION OF OUTCOMES  

<table><tr><td>Committee</td><td>Action</td></tr><tr><td>Sustainability Division Management</td><td>Deliberate</td></tr><tr><td>Sustainability &amp; Energy Transition Committee (SETC)</td><td>Review</td></tr><tr><td>Board Sustainability &amp; Risk Committee (BSRC)</td><td>Validate</td></tr><tr><td>Board of Directors</td><td>Approve</td></tr></table>

# Responsible Business and Financial Performance

We are committed to upholding responsible business practices while maintaining solid financial performance. Our strategy aims to foster long-term resilience by leveraging our core activities and exploring new growth opportunities sustainably, while delivering values to our shareholders. Our corporate governance structure complies with the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance (MCCG) and aligns with international best practices and standards in the areas of good governance, compliance and transparency to effectively facilitate our business operations and growth.

# SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURES ON MATERIAL MATTERS

# MM1: Responsible Business and Financial Performance

With a strong governance structure, the TNB BOD and Management play active roles in making strategic decisions to support TNB's position as a leader in the energy sector, enhancing value for stakeholders and providing stable financial returns to our shareholders. We remain committed to our dividend policy which aims to provide stable and sustainable dividends, while maintaining an effective capital structure that supports our growth and expansion strategies. As a result of a solid corporate governance system that defines roles and responsibilities, the BSRC and Management oversee the main climate-related decisions aimed at creating value for shareholders over the long term, in cognisant of the environmental and social impacts.

![](images/d02a205cd7eaa05e6ae5314a1b34131fa2439fcc087cef47bc95297cf66e90b9.jpg)

# MANAGEMENT APPROACH

Our governance structure reflects our commitment for strong financial performance while ensuring excellence in corporate governance. Key elements of our governance structure include clear roles and responsibilities of TNB BOD and sub-Boards. TNB BOD places high importance on responsible business with integrity, by establishing the Board Integrity Committee (BIC) in 2015.

See page 185 in the IAR for the TNB BIC roles and responsibilities. See page 183 in the IAR for the TNB Corporate Governance Statement and the Statement of Risk Management and Internal Control (SORMIC) and page 219 for our financial performance.

# TNB CODE OF BUSINESS ETHICS (COBE)

We have established a comprehensive TNB Code of Business Ethics (COBE), approved by TNB BOD, which applies to all directors and employees at all levels. It outlines the ethical principles and expected behaviours in engagements with our stakeholders including shareholders, customers, vendors, and the communities in which we operate.

The COBE includes guidelines on conflicts of interest, giving and accepting business courtesies and the use of company assets and resources with care. It governs our decision-making and conduct, reinforcing our commitment to integrity. The TNB COBE is reviewed as and when needed.

The BIC oversees the effective implementation of TNB COBE to ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations, sound employment practices, confidentiality and privacy.

# ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND ANTI-TERRORISM FINANCING

We strictly prohibit money laundering or terrorism financing offences in our business operations. Any suspicious, irrelevant or unusual transactions are immediately reported to the Management and TNB BOD, for necessary actions.

# TNB CORPORATE INTEGRITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (TCIMS)

We are committed to adhering with guidelines required by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC). The TCIMS is designed to foster an integrity-based culture across the TNB Group by mitigating the risk of misconduct and corruption in compliance with international anti-bribery standards. The TCIMS allows both TNB personnel and external parties to report misconduct or illegal activities via the TNB Whistle Blowing Information System (WBIS), whereby all concerns are independently investigated with actions taken accordingly.

The TCIMS consists of the following four (4) policies:

![](images/855a06c446790e6fefb7439316c68c1d9c78b3a8158d876a4b3b731db0f1ed51.jpg)

# Anti-Corruption through TNB Anti-Bribery Policy

TNB upholds a zero tolerance approach to bribery and corruption where we explicitly state that bribery and corruption are strictly prohibited in all forms, including offering, giving, soliciting or accepting bribes. This policy applies equally to all our business dealings with commercial business associates (vendors, consultants, joint venture partners, consortium partners, advisors, agents), government entities and countries worldwide without exception.

![](images/fdb5266396af7ba955e2e4d05145448f179583d70aeef43b09cf05d72d45e215.jpg)

# Conflict of Interest (COI) Policy

This policy requires TNB BOD and all employees to declare any potential, perceived, or actual conflicts of interest promptly, using established mechanisms. All employees, including directors and top management sign an Integrity Pledge, declare COI annually, and disclose their interests particularly in competing businesses to ensure transparent and ethical decision-making.

In 2024, we enhanced this policy by emphasising the roles and responsibilities of TNB BOD and key senior management, including subsidiaries, in alignment with the MMLR. In addition, the guideline on COI Management for BOD and key senior management was established to facilitate conflict of interest management process. The enhanced COI Policy and guideline were reviewed by an independent third party, endorsed and approved by the BIC and TNB BOD.

![](images/64a6a58e471e34502776ebf9345e17ecd4ec70eae45d2a9e4080de29032dca34.jpg)

# Gifts, Hospitality, and Related Benefits Policy

This policy outlines strict guidelines on the acceptance of gifts and hospitality, aiming to ensure transparency in all interactions with external parties. It includes provisions for political donations which are strictly overseen by the BIC. In 2024, no political contributions were made.

![](images/55369de78a79e9aac403ab39fe39c8021a7272d2e2097aeca8e10c75ca899801.jpg)

# Whistleblowing Policy

This policy supports an open working environment where unethical or unlawful conduct can be reported confidentially and without fear of reprisal. TNB provides multiple channels for reporting including an online system and a toll-free number, ensuring all concerns are investigated independently and feedback is provided to the complainants. In 2024, the whistleblower management process was reviewed by an independent third party with positive observations.

# CORRUPTION RISK ASSESSMENT & ETHICAL AUDITS

Corruption risk exposures are continually assessed across all business operations to identify exposures in areas such as bribery, fraud, abuse of power, theft, false claims, cheating and disciplinary issues. A total of 1,458 causes related to business ethics identified in the business processes are registered and monitored in TNB Risk Information System (TRIS) and risk controls are implemented by respective business entities. The Organisational Anti-Corruption Plan (OACP) outlines anti-corruption initiatives to prevent corruption and integrity violations, as well as to elevate transparency and accountability.

Annual internal and external audits on our Anti-Bribery Management System (ABMS) are carried out to all identified key business operations which includes Grid, Distribution Network, Retail, New Energy, Regulatory & Stakeholder Management, Single Buyer, Group Corporate Communication, Company Secretary, TNB Global Business Solutions, Group Finance, Group People, Procurement & Supply Chain, Strategy & Ventures, ICT, Sustainability, Group Internal Audit, Legal Services, and Grid System Operator.

# SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURES ON MATERIAL MATTERS

# MM1: Responsible Business and Financial Performance

ABMS audits are to ensure compliance with internal policies and assess effectiveness of risk mitigations on corruption risk exposures including fraud and bribery. These audits are conducted by independent internal and external experts for unbiased evaluations and recommendations. The outcome from the audits are reported to Integrity Committee for management review and to BIC as the governing body. Every year, workshops on fraud and bribery risk are conducted for targeted business operations.

# STRENGTHENING TNB INTEGRITY CULTURE

# Ethical Behaviour Training & Communication

A comprehensive training plan on ethical behaviour is outlined in our annual Training & Communication Plan (TCP). The TCP is an important component in our strategy to foster a strong integrity culture. This comprehensive plan includes ethical standards training for TNB BOD, employees, contractors, and vendors. The training elements in TCP, among others, include integrity seminars tailored for TNB BOD and top management, Integrity e-learning for all employees, contractors and vendors, and in-person awareness sessions with employees. The TCP also covers communication strategies such as publications of integrity bulletins and e-posters communicated through internal channels. The progress and effectiveness of the TCP is periodically reported to the BIC.

We continuously invest in the competency of our employees in integrity management. In 2024, 41 employees have successfully completed the Certified Integrity Officers (CeIO) programme by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Academy (MACA).

# MM2: Energy Transition and Innovation

# Long Duration Energy Storage (LDES)

TNB is exploring on a LDES solution with a potential of 1,750MW at our hydro power plants utilising Hydro Energy Storage System (HESS). Technically, HESS stores energy by pumping downstream water at hydro plant back into the dam during period of excess energy generated from non-dispatchable renewables resources such as Solar PV. The stored water can be utilised to generate electricity in stabilising the grid due to the dynamics of Renewable Energy generation and electricity demand, and assist in restoring the power system in the event of blackout. Additionally, HESS can complement the intermittency power generation caused by solar PV thus allowing higher capacity of solar PV to connect with the Grid, supporting the National Energy Transition Roadmap's goals.

![](images/11b471c361ed42d0fbf8fe7cb8fe818127fbef06b5ac8953199f4bbfd79a70c0.jpg)

HESS uses a system of two interconnected reservoirs with one at a higher elevation than the other. During the period of surplus energy (pumping mode) water is pumped from lower reservoir to upper reservoir using excess energy from solar. Whereas during the period of excess demand (generating mode), water is released from upper reservoir and flows down through turbines to generate electricity.

# PROGRESSING ASEAN POWER GRID DEVELOPMENT FOR ENHANCED REGIONAL CONNECTIVITY

# Climate Change and Emissions

Taking a decisive step towards combating climate change, Malaysia has developed the National Climate Change Policy 2.0 that is anchored on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. In TNB, we acknowledge the impact we have on climate change as well as the threats of climate change to our business. We consistently assess climate related risks and opportunities to our assets, business operations and growth, with a robust climate adaptation and mitigation plan to enhance business resiliency.

In support of targets outlined in the Paris Agreement and United Nations 2030 Agenda as well as Malaysia's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to reduce economy-wide carbon intensity against GDP by  $45\%$  by 2030 compared to 2005, TNB aims to reduce our annual carbon emissions intensity for Scope 1 by  $5\%$  annually from 2024. This annual target reflects our steadfast commitment to achieve  $35\%$  carbon emissions intensity reduction by 2035 and Net Zero by 2050. Our efforts to reduce carbon emissions intensity is outlined in our Carbon Management Strategy and Renewable Energy (RE) Capacity Expansion.

The TNB Energy Transition Plan, which cuts across the electricity value chain, continues to direct focused efforts in addressing climate change and GHG emissions reduction as we transition to a low-carbon economy. In the spirit of a just transition, we believe that building a strong and positive relationship with stakeholders and strategic partners is essential in view of the complexity and uncertainties inherent in energy transition.

# MANAGEMENT APPROACH

# SERVING MALAYSIA'S ECONOMIC GROWTH WHILE REDUCING EMISSIONS

As Malaysia's economy progresses, electricity demand has shown consistent growth. Historical trends reveal that the national power sector's emissions has risen in tandem with GDP and electricity demand. From 2018 to 2024, Malaysia's GDP grew at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of  $3.9\%$ , surpassing the power sector's absolute emissions CAGR of approximately  $1\%$  and TNB's own absolute emissions CAGR of  $0.8\%$ . This indicates that TNB's absolute emissions have been contained at a slower rate compared to the growth in GDP working towards greener fuel mix.

Looking ahead, Malaysia's GDP is projected to continue its growth trajectory from 2025 to 2030. The ongoing energy transition is expected to result in a reduction in emissions, while still supporting positive GDP growth. TNB's emissions are anticipated to decrease further through the effective implementation of its Energy Transition (ET) Plan.

# TNB'S COMMITMENT IN ADDRESSED CLIMATE RISKS & OPPORTUNITIES

Since 2019, we have adopted the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework that serves as a comprehensive approach for assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities. We are persistent in evaluating and mitigating both physical and transition risks, drawing guidance from the Representative Concentrating Pathways (RCP) scenarios by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as well as scenarios suggested by the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS). Furthermore, we identify business opportunities linked to transitioning to a low-carbon economy and execute adaptation strategies for climate change impacts like floods, heatwave, soil movement and coastal flooding.

# CARBON MANAGEMENT STRATEGY: REDUCE, CAPTURE, OFFSET

# Reduce Carbon Emissions

In our relentless pursuit of a sustainable future, we are committed to achieving  $19\%$  reduction in carbon emissions intensity by 2050, through a series of targeted initiatives.

# Enhancing Power Plant Efficiency

Carbon emissions are reduced by optimising fuel consumption at our thermal power plants to generate the same amount of electricity. To achieve this, we continuously monitor the heat rate of our thermal power plants and implement various efficiency enhancement initiatives, which include coal blending, periodic boiler cleaning, condenser cleaning, and compressor washing. We also leverage on Digital Twin technology to optimise power plant performances by simulating different scenarios and identifying the most efficient operating conditions.

# SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURES ON MATERIAL MATTERS

# MM3: Climate Change and Emissions

# Transitioning Energy Sources

We continue to explore the feasibility of retiring our coal-fired power plants ahead of schedule, subject to shareholders' agreement and approvals from relevant authorities and regulators. This is expected to reduce emissions from our coal power plants, as they retire according to their respective Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), as follows:

![](images/8073b03026fd15e65bdda76c56d04abfd10d99606cceafb036e23588c5a34aec.jpg)

Initiatives are ongoing as part of our efforts to transition to alternative energy sources:

# Hydrogen Fuel: Paving the way for a Sustainable Energy Future

Building upon the TNB-PETRONAS MOU entered in 2022 to decarbonise the energy sector, a joint feasibility study on green hydrogen as an alternative clean energy was completed in 2024. Both parties are entering into a strategic collaboration agreement to explore a joint venture for the development of end-to-end green hydrogen value chain towards establishing Peninsular Malaysia as a green hydrogen hub.

# Hydrogen Production for TNB Power Plant Operations

In 2024, TNB Research Sdn. Bhd. (TNBR) initiated a project on green hydrogen production system that is feasible, efficient, and scalable for the power sector. A 500kWp rooftop solar installation, coupled with a 1MWh battery system, would supply the energy needed by the electrolyser to produce an estimated  $125,000\mathrm{Nm}^3$  of green hydrogen annually. The green hydrogen produced will be used for generator cooling at one of TNB's power plants, while other potential applications are being explored simultaneously.

# Ammonia-Biomass Co-firing at Coal Power Plants

Following the successful execution of the Empty Fruit Bunch (EFB) Pellet Trial Burn at the Jimah East Power (JEP) (1,000MW Unit 2) Power Plant, further assessment and studies are ongoing to evaluate the technical behaviour under increased concentrations.

# Biomass as Sustainable Fuel of the Future

In 2024, TNB Fuel Services Sdn. Bhd. (TNBF) supplied and delivered 4,305 metric tonnes of biomass in the form of EFB pellets to Tanjung Bin Power Sdn. Bhd., a subsidiary of Malakoff Berhad, as part of the co-firing project in the NETR.

# Capture Carbon Emissions

We aim to achieve a  $30\%$  reduction in carbon emissions intensity by 2050 through the implementation of advanced carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) technologies, which are:

Carbon Utilisation: Development of a  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  utilisation system through biological and hydrogenation pathways.

A project was initiated in June 2024 to assess the technical and economic viability of integrating CCU technology at the Jimah East Power (JEP) coal power plant. The goal is to successfully capture up to  $5,000\mathrm{kg}$  of  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  annually using microalgae.

# Advancing Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) Solutions through Strategic Partnerships

The first stage of a CCUS joint feasibility study with PETRONAS was completed in the first half of 2024, on the costs involved in capturing carbon and transporting it to the receiving terminal. In the next stage, the study shall focus on the costs of sequestration, as well as obtaining supportive government policy including carbon tax.

# Offset Carbon Emissions

We have been diligently investing in nature-based carbon offset initiatives such as reforestation to tackle hard-to-abate emissions. We target to plant 40,000 trees annually, covering about 89 acres and sequestering approximately 1,600 tCO $_2$ e. In 2024, a total of 49,214 trees were planted at 25 designated areas across the country, which is equivalent to approximately 91.65 acres and 1,968.60 tCO $_2$ e sequestered.

# Our Response to Challenges and Unforeseeable Incident

As we have established our Carbon Management Strategy and committed to an annual  $5 \%$ reduction in scope 1 emissions intensity starting from 2024, we acknowledge a slight increase in our 2024 emissions intensity compared to 2023. This was due to an unforeseeable incident on 4 December 2023, when our 1,000MW TNB Manjung Unit 4 (M4) Ultra-Super Critical coal power plant faced an approximately 11- month forced outage due to steam turbine blade damage. To ensure grid system security and meet rising customer demand, higher-emissions sub- critical coal power plants were dispatched during this period.

Through a collaborative effort with the OEM and an efficient crisis recovery strategy, we successfully expedited M4's restoration by 10 days, preventing an excess emissions of approximately 329,323 tCO $_2$ e.

To enhance the reliability of our coal power plants and prevent recurrence of similar incidents, we are implementing robust measures, including improving steam quality, conducting regular blade inspections using Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) methods, and monitoring vibrations to detect early signs of anomalies.

# SCOPE 2 EMISSIONS: IMPROVING ENERGY EFFICIENCY WITHIN OUR OPERATIONS

We are dedicated to reducing our energy consumption intensity to lower our Scope 2 emissions through energy efficiency initiatives.

# Improving Power Plant Auxiliary Energy Consumption

We are implementing energy efficient initiatives at our power plants for the auxiliary systems such as co-firing of high-sulfur coal with lower-sulfur brands to decrease auxiliary consumption in the Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) aeration fan and absorber spray pump, optimising the auto-changeover frequency of air compressors and adjusting the operation of the Main Cooling Water Pump (MCWP). By optimising these auxiliary systems, energy is utilised efficiently leading to reduced overall energy consumption.

# Enhancing Energy Efficiency at TNB Office Buildings

Through the “Drip by Drip, Watt by Watt” campaign rolled out since July 2023, we are actively reducing electricity and water consumption at 109 TNB-owned offices. This campaign promotes energy conscious practices, fosters a collective commitment among TNB personnel towards resource conservation, that leads

to cost savings. TNB personnel towards resource conservation, leading to cost savings. In 2024, our efforts have resulted in a reduction of 1,723,244 kWh in electricity consumption, equivalent to an estimated reduction of 1,333 tCO $_2$ e in Scope 2 emissions and RM877,131.00 cost savings.

# Our Flagship Green Building – TNB Platinum Campus

The TNB Platinum Campus is designed in accordance with Green Building Index (GBI) principles, adopting key features such as a  $25\%$  reduction in electricity consumption compared to conventional building designs. It includes a photovoltaic system capable of supplying up to  $2\%$  of the building's total electricity needs, along with efficient energy monitoring facilitated by the Integrated Building Management System's Energy Sub-Metering System.

# Reliable Energy and Fair Tariff

Our commitment to stakeholders extends beyond merely providing a secure and reliable electricity supply; it encompasses addressing their expectations regarding affordability and sustainability. In addressing the future of the electricity industry within Malaysia, TNB is strategically navigating the evolving regulatory and policy landscape to ensure the best outcomes for its business, stakeholders, and the broader community. It is here that we recognise the symbiotic relationship between government support, TNB's proactive measures and the collective move towards a sustainable energy transition.

# SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURES ON MATERIAL MATTERS

# MM4: Reliable Energy and Fair Tariff

We continue to see the Malaysian government's steadfast support for the Incentive-Based Regulation (IBR) framework, which has been governing our electricity sector since 2014 and implemented for three (3) Regulatory Periods (RP). The IBR framework has enabled enhancements in our network infrastructure, including the improved agility, flexibility and regional interconnectivity of the grid. In December 2024, the government has approved TNB Regulatory Period 4 (RP4) with RM42.82 billion of CAPEX, which consists of RM26.55 billion base CAPEX and RM16.27 billion contingent CAPEX, allocated from 2025 to 2027 to accelerate energy transition plan for the nation. TNB continues to perform beyond the requirements of the IBR framework, with world-class System Minutes and System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) ensuring reliable energy is supplied to our customers. With the IBR framework, tariffs are established in a fair and transparent manner to address local economic growth and socioeconomic challenges.

# MANAGEMENT APPROACH

# ENSURING RELIABLE SUPPLY

In 2024, we upheld our world-class grid performance, recording Transmission System Minutes of 0.0019 minutes and a System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) of 47.88 minutes. This achievement is an outcome of our implementation of the ISO 55001 Asset Management System, which promotes optimal asset performance through structured and systematic approaches, including risk-based preventive maintenance supported by data analytics. Additionally, a total of RM3.2 billion was invested in FY2024, to strengthen grid network resiliency ensuring continuous reliable supply to customers despite facing complexity with greater demand supply and RE interconnection and more complex system in near future.

Moving forward for RP4 (2025-2027), we intend to increase investments in the national grid to make the grid more modern, reliable and dynamic in addressing the challenges of Energy Transition. We believe that the demand for clean and renewable energy will continue to grow spurred by the trend in digitalisation and artificial intelligence that requires more data centres to be constructed, as such will continue to play our role in strengthening grid resiliency and reliability in delivering top notch product and services for our customers.

We have introduced the Green Lane Pathway, a strategic initiative aimed at enhancing Malaysia's data centre market. This pathway offers efficient and environmentally responsible solutions for data centre operators by streamlining the onboarding process, expediting approvals, and facilitating a smoother setup of data centre operations in the country.

A key feature of the Green Lane Pathway is its fast-track electricity supply, which connects data centres three times faster than the standard delivery time. This reduces the implementation period from range of 36 to 48 months to just 12 months. Since the establishment of the Green Lane Pathway, we have successfully completed all 18 supply connections ahead of schedule, meeting a demand of 1,856MW. In 2024, we completed nine (9) data centres electricity supply projects, with a total energy demand of 1,236MW, which represents  $66\%$  of the total energy demand. Additionally, TNB has established a One-Stop Centre (OSC) to assist data centre investors, providing dedicated support services to attract more companies to establish their operations in Malaysia.

# ROBUST BUSINESS CONTINUITY MANAGEMENT (BCM)

In the event of disruptions to our business, we are fully committed to preparing and responding effectively, guided by the TNB Corporate Business Continuity Management (BCM) Framework. Our BCM Framework provides a structured approach that enables us to respond quickly and effectively while ensuring the continuity of our operations towards greater resilience.

In time of needs, mobile generator set will be despatched to ensure continuous power supply to our customers.

# FAIR AND TRANSPARENT TARIFF DETERMINATION

The electricity tariff structure is governed by the Energy Commission (EC) based on the IBR framework with built-in incentives to improve our efficiency and for greater tariff transparency to our customers. TNB is protected against fuel cost fluctuations with the effective implementation of the Imbalance Cost Pass-Through (ICPT) mechanism within the IBR framework.

Below is the electricity ecosystem and regulatory framework which supports a transparent tariff structure:

![](images/d8f9684fd8dec6b8b866e660e3040f28206298faa7886137f126a03999db1690.jpg)

In 2024, the Government continues to uphold the Imbalance Cost Pass-Through (ICPT) mechanism, focusing on a more targeted approach for domestic customers for 1H2024. This includes the removal of rebates for domestic customers with consumption between 600 - 1,500 kWh, ensuring that subsidies are allocated more effectively to protect vulnerable groups.

Overall, the ICPT framework has proven to be an effective mechanism for maintaining the balance between ensuring sustainable electricity

supply and supporting vulnerable customers, ultimately contributing to the stability of the electricity market in Malaysia. For the upcoming ICPT implementation, TNB will continue to ensure that the ICPT mechanism remains effective and responsive to market conditions. TNB will work closely with the Government to further enhance the ICPT mechanism through forward forecast approach, alongside frequent adjustment of the additional generation costs. This enhancement will also balance the need for fair pricing.

# SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURES ON MATERIAL MATTERS

# MM4: Reliable Energy and Fair Tariff

The Government has launched the Corporate Renewable Energy Supply Scheme (CRESS) in September 2024 to enhance corporate access to green electricity supply. CRESS is a strategic initiative which aims to provide corporations with greater access to green electricity, reinforcing Malaysia's commitment to a sustainable energy future. This programme leverages the concept of open grid access, enabling third parties to supply electricity to their preferred customers using the grid network under a regulated system access charge.

CRESS principle ensures that energy prices are determined through voluntary agreements between parties, free from external compulsion. This concept facilitates a marketplace where the price of energy is negotiated in good faith, with both buyer and seller seeking mutually acceptable terms. The aim is to create a transparent, fair, and competitive environment that ensures both sides can sustain their interests.

For the first phase, CRESS is open to high and medium voltage power consumers. This means that existing buildings, on top of buildings requiring new or additional power demand, can utilise green electricity through the CRESS policy in Malaysia.

# REGULATORY ENGAGEMENT TO STRENGTHEN INSTITUTIONAL GOVERNANCE

We consistently engage with regulatory stakeholders to enhance the governance framework of the electricity sector, working towards balancing the energy trilemma. We continue to contribute to governmental studies and policy formulation, including the implementation of the National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR) flagship projects and the CRESS.

The effectiveness of our engagement efforts is reflected in the Regulatory Relationship Strength Index (RRSI) score, which gauges the sentiment and expectations of key ministries, regulators, and government agencies that directly interact with TNB. Dedicated TNB personnel engage with stakeholders at the federal and state levels to address potential issues and enhance mutual collaboration. We achieved our highest RRSI score in 2024 with an overall trust score of  $94\%$ , surpassing our target of  $92\%$ , showcasing a consistent increase since 2020.

# MANAGEMENT APPROACH

# SAFETY, HEALTH & GOVERNANCE OVERSIGHT

We have strengthened our governance by enhancing the oversight and management of health and safety matters. In 2024, the Terms of Reference and membership of the TNB Health, Safety & Environment Committee (HSEC) have been enhanced with approving authority to drive the implementation of HSE across TNB. Chaired by the Chief Distribution Network Officer (CDNO), with members from the top management of key operations and corporate functions, the HSEC deliberates strategies and monitors the performance of initiatives implemented across TNB Group. The Board Sustainability and Risk Committee (BSRC) and TNB Group Executive Management Committee (GEMC), chaired by the President/Chief Executive Officer, maintain oversight on the implementation of HSE strategies and initiatives.

We uphold rigorous safety standards with the aim of zero workplace fatality and maintaining a Lost-Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) below 1.0.

In 2024, the number of fatal accidents remained at four (4) as per previous year. A detailed diagnostics based on past incidents was conducted to identify strategic initiatives to enhance our health and safety management practices across the organisation. GEMC approved the identified key focus areas as follows:

![](images/ef19c0baddd1991f16933f7ef5b8f20d433fc64f5968d41e201ed786c3195c50.jpg)

We have zero tolerance to fatality and every fatal accident is investigated and deliberated vigorously to identify root causes and actions to prevent recurrence. In the event of a fatal accident, the HSEC convenes immediately to ensure urgent mitigations are taken. The outcomes of fatality investigations are deliberated at GEMC and BSRC.

We remain guided by the TNB Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Policy, which underscores our unwavering commitment to adhering to relevant legislation and regulations. This includes complying with all the relevant laws and regulations, namely the Occupational Safety and Health Act 1994, Electricity Supply Act 1990, Fire Services Act 1988, as well as the Energy Commission licensing conditions.

The Health, Safety and Environment Management System (HSEMS) provides a framework for TNB Group to ensure the health and safety of employees, contractors and the public are managed holistically and systematically, based on the principles of ISO management systems.

Our business entities that are currently certified with ISO 45001:2018 Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems are:

# Health & Safety Training For Employees

We are committed to building employee capability in health and safety practices and culture, ensuring that safety remains paramount in all our endeavours and is ingrained in every aspect of our TNB operations. Every two years, employees undergo mandatory safety and health training through the Tenaga Safety Passport module.

To enable greater self-regulation among our employees, HSEMS implementation training is provided to employees to ensure they are adequately trained to implement health and safety practices in respective workplaces.

We continue to provide health and safety trainings for our employees. In 2024, a total of 13,973 employees group-wide attended the related trainings, underscoring our dedication to equip our workforce with the essential health and safety skills and knowledge.

# Health & Safety Risk Assessments

We meticulously identify all work-related hazards, assess the health and safety risks, and establish relevant controls to eliminate hazards and mitigate risks through our Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment, and Risk Control (HIRARC) procedure. Our HIRARC procedure is developed based on guidelines from the Department of Occupational Safety & Health (DOSH) and forms the foundation of our safety protocols. HIRARC procedures must be carried out prior to the commencement of any project and maintenance works. We conduct regular training sessions on HIRARC to ensure comprehensive understanding and implementation of the procedure across our operations.

Specific risk assessments are also conducted to assess exposures related to the workplace and work conditions such as Chemical Health Risk Assessment (HRA), Noise Risk Assessment (NRA) and Ergonomic Risk Assessment (ERA).

# Life Saving Rules

We have implemented five (5) out of six (6) Life Saving Rules (LSR), which are LSR 1-5, with the primary objective of preventing serious accidents that could result in fatalities among employees and contractors. In 2024, the LSR consequence management process was enhanced with the inclusion of human factor assessment.

<table><tr><td colspan="2">Core Rules</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">LSR 1:

We refined our incident investigation process by incorporating the Human Factor Analysis (HFA), a methodology introduced by Energy Institute, United Kingdom, to effectively identify the cause of human errors in an accident. This effort is to ensure fair justification is reached when human errors have resulted in fatal accidents before the consequence management process takes into effect. To effectively implement this initiative, 30 employees from various business entities were trained in-house by a representative from Energy Institute.

# Occupational Health

We continue our efforts to strengthen occupational health (OH) practices by focusing on noise, ergonomic, and chemical management initiatives. Aligned with regulatory requirements, assessments in these areas were conducted with verification by internal audits and external parties.

We continue to participate in the Systematic OH Enhancement Level Program (SOHELP) organised by DOSH. This programme drives occupational health compliance and improves overall health among employees, where companies with best practices based on a year of evaluation are acknowledged in the annual National SOHELP Convention. A total of 17 business entities with high exposure have enrolled in the SOHELP programme to drive the reduction of occupational diseases. In 2024, our OH practices were acknowledged with  $2^{\text{nd}}$  Prize in the Best SOHELP Award (Category 2 - Conglomerate Company) at the National SOHELP Convention 2024.

# Public Safety Awareness Programme

As a caring and responsible organisation, we are committed to enhancing public safety. Any incidents related to TNB electrical installation involving the public safety are highly of our importance. TNB management, through HSE committee reviews investigation outcomes and identifies mitigation actions for each incident, overseen by BSRC to prevent recurrence. Significant effort has been carried out to mitigate these incidents to happen in the future through collaborative efforts with both internal and external stakeholders.

Key initiatives include the "RumahKu Selamat" campaign, where we encourage employees and contractors to promote electrical safety within their families. We also engaged targeted community groups, particularly those in plantations focusing on palm, paddy farmers, and fishermen to educate them about electrical hazards and safety.

An integrated public safety campaign during flood season raises awareness about electrical safety before, during, and after floods. It engages customers in flood-affected states through multilingual print media, digital and radio advertisements, personalised myTNB engagements, and visits to temporary flood shelters to distribute safety posters. These were further shared on TNB's social media accounts and through collaborations with Key Opinion Leaders (KOL), reinforcing the importance of electrical safety as part of disaster preparedness. Additionally, we work closely with the Energy Commission (EC) and local authorities to ensure compliance and safety in house renovations and TNB installations. Through these initiatives, we strive to foster a safer environment and promote sustainable practices within our communities.

We instill safety to be an integral aspect of our employees' everyday working culture by anchoring on four (4) core behaviours of "Assess," "Comply," "Intervene" and "Actively Caring" (ACIA). To nurture these fundamental behaviours, we implement a wide range of initiatives to progressively inculcate the safety mindset. We conduct Safety Culture Assessment (SCA) once every two (2) years to promote leadership involvement and foster a sense of health and safety ownership by adopting the "Hearts and Minds Safety Culture Toolkit" methodology developed by the Energy Institute in the United Kingdom. The last assessment was conducted in 2023 where the result was at "Proactive" level. This year we focus our efforts to address gaps identified through the Safety Culture Management Plan (SCMP).

Our appointed HSE Culture Change Agents (HSE CCAs) act as ambassadors who advocate the ACIA behaviour through interactions and consistent communication, as well as monitoring and evaluating workplace safety. This encourages employees' participation in health and safety implementation with two-way communication to inculcate the Tenaga Safety Culture.

Our group-wide Nampak, Dengar & Rasa Selamat (NDRS) framework advocates occupational safety and health awareness and practices. This framework anchors on three (3) core elements, namely engineering, education and enforcement, and is supported by a consequence management process that rewards positive behaviour, encourages good practices, and addresses non-compliance appropriately. We give recognition to individuals and business entities for outstanding performance and behaviour during NDRS Award ceremony that is conducted every year.

In 2024, we further reinforced our TNB Stop Work Policy by implementing the Intervensi Stop Work (ISW) guideline across the Group, whereby all employees are empowered to intervene and stop work if an unsafe condition or act is observed. This initiative is enabled through the HSE Wallet mobile application for real-time reporting and response.

# ADVANCING HSE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION

We leverage on digitalisation to manage and centralise HSE data with the progressive rollout of modules for the holistic implementation of our eHSE online system. The TNB Safety Information System (TSIS) captures reports of incidents and near misses, and incidents are investigated to identify corrective and preventive actions to prevent recurrence. The HSE Wallet mobile application enables employees to record potential incidents, stop work intervention occurrences and good safety and health practices across the Group.

In 2024, we upgraded eHSE system by integrating multiple modules that incorporate Non-Conformance Report (NCR), Notice, Compound & Lawsuit (NCL), Safety Health Committee Online, Chemical Register and Legal Compliance. This upgrade streamlines our HSE processes to strengthen compliance and accountability across the Group and facilitates analysis and diagnostics for informed decisions.

# SUPPORTING EMPLOYEES' HEALTH AND WELLNESS

We encourage our employees to stay active by continuing our wellness programme through subscription to the BookDoc mobile application where all employees are encouraged to track their daily steps as part of our initiative to promote fitness.

We conduct basic health screenings for all employees nationwide to monitor their health status. The health screening provides a baseline for employees to gauge their vital health statistics such as blood glucose levels, blood pressure, and Body Mass Index (BMI). Where necessary, TNB's Wellness Team will provide basic counselling and advice to employees on steps to modify their lifestyle and improve their overall health. Intervention plans are also made available such as M-Quit, a programme to help employees to quit smoking, and Biggest Loser challenge, a 6-month programme to manage weight and fitness.

Weekly 'Wellness Wednesday' and monthly "Are You Ok? Jom Sembang" webinars are held throughout the year in collaboration with panel hospitals on health and wellness-related topics, open to all employees and retirees. These webinars, with at least 1,000 participants each session, aim to increase awareness on common global health issues and holistic wellbeing, including identification and control of physical and mental health, treatment of bacterial and viral diseases, and prevention through healthier habits and lifestyle. In 2024, over 50 global health topics were conducted in this webinar sessions, ranging from various subjects including bipolar disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and depressions, stress management, cancer, diabetes, eye disease, monkey pox infection, and weight management.

# WATER MANAGEMENT

At TNB, we recognise that water is a finite resource. Water management initiatives and performance are among the key focus areas that are presented and deliberated in the SETC, demonstrating our commitment to efficient water management in our operations.

The SETC is chaired by the President/Chief Executive Officer (CEO), with members from TNB's top management team, to ensure executive-level responsibility for environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters. Our commitment to water efficiency is not just a responsibility but also a testament to our dedication to sustainable practices and resource conservation.

In FY2024, TNB consumed a total of 9,029 megalitres of water, a reduction of around  $10\%$  compared to the previous year. We withdraw water from seawater, surface water and town water for our operations, of which an estimated  $90\%$  or more was discharged back to the respective sources. Our focus, therefore, is to optimise the use of the  $0.1\%$  of town water withdrawn, where  $0.013\%$  of it is treated and safely discharged to nature. Our main efforts are concentrated on optimising the use of the remaining town water withdrawn through efficient operations, enhanced technologies, and innovation.

# SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURES ON MATERIAL MATTERS

# MM6: Biodiversity & Environmental Management

# Town Water Optimisation in Thermal Power Plant Operations

Our thermal power plants were built and continue to operate in accordance with the World Bank Environmental and Social Standards which include stringent water consumption protocols, aligned with high-efficiency thermal plant operations, reflecting our dedication to responsible and sustainable resource management.

Our power plant steam generation process is designed as a closed-loop system aimed at minimising reliance on town water sources. From 2023 to date, average water intensity (water consumption from town water source per net generation of respective plant) of our power plants is much lower than our counterparts with similar power plant technology, demonstrating our commitment to responsible water use.

Furthermore, we specialise in state-of-the-art plant upgrade initiatives. For instance, to address increasing water consumption since 2021 at our combined-cycle gas turbine plant, Sultan Ibrahim Power Plant, we installed 100 units of Zero Leakage Valve at the Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) in 2024 to reduce town water consumption.

# Alternative Water Sources for Thermal Power Plant Cooling System

For our power plant cooling system, we utilise alternative sources such as seawater and river water to minimise dependency on town water sources.

Our open circuit Main Cooling Water (MCW) system effectively employs these sources, discharging water back into the sea at temperatures and chlorine levels compliant with the Department of Environment (DOE) standards, resulting in zero net water consumption. This approach underscores our commitment to sustainable practices and environmental stewardship, aligning with global water conservation standards established by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). The average water intensity (water consumption from town water source per net generation of the respective plants) for our power plants is much lower than our counterparts using similar power plant technology.

# TNB Generation Assets Located in Areas of Low Water Stress

All of TNB generation assets in Peninsular Malaysia are strategically located in areas with zero water withdrawals from water-stressed areas. Our water stress mapping is based on the Aqueduct by the World Resources Institute. This proactive approach prevents potential conflicts over water use between industry and local communities.

# Rainwater Harvesting

# WASTE MANAGEMENT

At TNB, our operations generate both hazardous and non-hazardous waste, each requiring tailored management and disposal strategies. We systematically categorise waste by its characteristics, origin, and potential environmental impact. This approach enables us to implement effective disposal, recycling, and treatment methods aligned with best practices.

Guided by the principles of the circular economy, TNB strives to establish a closed-loop waste management system that minimises waste generation, reduces environmental impact, and contributes to a sustainable future. Our initiatives are driven by our environmental policy and reflect our dedication to responsible environmental stewardship, focusing on:

# Raising Awareness:

Promoting sustainable environmental practices among internal teams and external stakeholders.

# Enhancing Systems:

Continuously improving our Health, Safety, and Environment Management System (HSEMS) to meet the highest safety and environmental standards.

# Innovative Technologies:

Investing in cutting-edge solutions to advance environmental management practices.

# Regulatory Compliance:

Ensuring full adherence to environmental laws and regulations while proactively identifying areas for improvement.

# Transparent Reporting:

Maintaining accountability through detailed reporting of our environmental performance.

Our waste management efforts extend beyond compliance, emphasising education and collaboration to inspire sustainable practices among stakeholders. In anticipation of increasing solar and battery assets, we are committed to manage the end-of-life of these assets. By doing so, we aim to meet regulatory standards and prevent environmental harm, contributing meaningfully to a sustainable future.

# Hazardous Waste Management

The TNB Scheduled Waste Roadmap 2018-2030 shapes our hazardous waste management strategy that is in line with national goals outlined in the DOE Strategic Engagement Plan 2021-2030. Our roadmap includes phased targets, starting with a  $30\%$  scheduled waste recycling rate by 2025.

Proactive waste prevention is our key priority and when waste generation is unavoidable, we manage it responsibly through the 4R approach — Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Recover — alongside alongside our circular economy practices.

In compliance with the Environmental Quality Act, we strictly enforce the TNB Scheduled Waste Disposal Management Guidelines across all operations, which includes a five-step standardised process to manage hazardous waste through classification, storage, packing and labelling, inventory management, disposal and continuous monitoring.

Scheduled waste generated from our operations, including lead acid batteries, lubricating and hydraulic oils, contaminated soil, and chemical containers, are treated through reuse, cementation, or incineration as per regulatory requirements. With tailored disposal methods such as recycling of electronic waste, and physical/chemical treatment for mercury waste, we ensure safe and compliant waste handling to reduce environmental impact.

In terms of performance monitoring, we utilise the DOE-governed ESWIS system to enable reliable data tracking.

TNB continues to uphold best practices in hazardous waste management through inspections, risk-based audits, and Self Visual Report (SVR) programme. The SVR aims to promote self-regulation practices and accountability across our operations. In 2024, a total of 640 SVRs were recorded across 86 storage facilities.

# Reducing Hazardous Waste and Maximising Recycling Rates

We have successfully reduced the amount of hazardous waste generated by  $3.67\%$  in 2024 (895,038 MT) compared to the previous year (929,123 MT). Of this hazardous waste,  $55.58\%$  (497,452 MT) was recycled.

Fly ash and bottom ash from our power generation operations constitute  $99\%$  of our total hazardous waste generated. The remaining hazardous waste is mainly used transformers, used lubricating oil, used batteries and e-waste.

Fly ash has substantial potential for reuse, particularly in construction. In 2024, we collaborated with ten (10) construction or cement companies to make use of the fly ash in the production of concrete and bricks, diverting the fly ash from landfills and promoting a circular economy. When recycling is not feasible, the fly ash is transported to secure, licensed landfills that adhere to DOE environmental standards.

# Enhancing E-Waste Management

Our e-waste management guidelines aim to significantly increase the amount of e-waste diverted from landfills. In 2024, we launched our E-Waste Inventory System for comprehensive e-waste tracking from waste generation to disposal, with our e-waste amounting to 10 metric tonnes (baseline). Moving forward, we aim to increase e-waste collection by  $10\%$  in 2025 from this baseline.

# Verification with Licensed Waste Collectors

We work exclusively with waste collectors licensed by DOE, ensuring responsible waste collection. To strengthen the validation of TNB's scheduled waste treatment, disposal methods, and data collection, we actively collaborate with our licensed vendors to ensure compliance and continuous improvement in our processes. In 2024, we began these efforts with onsite reviews, focusing on the collectors' waste treatment methods and inventory management. Visits to selected sites confirmed that  $75\%$  of our scheduled waste was recycled or recovered, reinforcing our commitment to the circular economy.

# A Streamlined Process for Responsible Disposal by Licensed Vendors

Damaged solar panels are stored at the licensed vendor's warehouse for responsible disposal, with approximately 300 panels already processed. The panels are meticulously dismantled, separating the glass and metal components. The glass is carefully broken down and disposed of at a designated industrial landfill, while the compressed metal is sold to a third party for recycling. For residential, commercial, industrial, and government clients, we prioritise recycling panels for reuse at other TNB sites if they are still under warranty and in good condition. This stringent approach not only ensures regulatory compliance but also significantly mitigates the environmental impact of our operations.

# MM6: Biodiversity & Environmental Management

# Responsible for End-of-Life Management of Solar Panels & Battery

As our solar capacity expands, so does our commitment to managing the end-of-life stage of solar panels. We recognise the importance of responsible end-of-life management for solar panels within a circular economy framework. By adhering to strict regulatory guidelines and employing the 3Rs principle (Reuse, Repurpose, Recycle), TNB ensures minimal environmental footprint during decommissioning. Furthermore, TNB actively explores avenues for panel reusability and recycling, aligning with Malaysia's ambitious target of achieving  $70\%$  renewable energy by 2050.

Our approach to solar panel end-of-life management adheres strictly to the Environmental Quality (Scheduled Waste) Regulation 2005, delegating the disposal process to licensed vendors under the close supervision of the DOE. This stringent approach ensures regulatory compliance and mitigates the environmental impact of our operations.

# A STREAMLINED PROCESS FOR RESPONSIBLE DISPOSAL BY LICENSED VENDORS

# Storage of Damaged Solar Panels

Damaged solar panels will be stored at the warehouse of the licensed vendor for further disposal. Approximately 300 solar panels waste have undergone the disposal exercise with the vendor.

# Segregation of Solar Panel Components

Damaged panels will be dismantled from their structures and separated. For photovoltaic (PV) panels, the glass and metal components are typically separated first. The glass is broken down, and the metal frames are compressed into bundles.

# Recycling and Disposal Process

Following segregation, the glass is disposed of at a designated industrial landfill. The compressed metal, meanwhile, is sold to a third-party for recycling.

# Residential, Commercial, and Industrial Solar Panels

For solar panels installed for residential, commercial, industrial, and government clients, we prioritise recycling them for reuse at other TNB sites if there is a suitable site for re-installation, and the panels are still under warranty and in good condition.

In alignment with our circular economy commitment, we proactively explore initiatives across the solar energy lifecycle, from procurement to end-of-life management. These initiatives serve as integral steps towards supporting Malaysia's target of achieving  $70\%$  RE capacity target by 2050.

# Procurement

We consider the recyclability of solar panels during procurement. This means prioritising components with high recycled content and favouring vendors with responsible sourcing practices.

# Product Lifespan Extension

We focus on extending the lifespan of panels through proper maintenance, cleaning, and potential repair programmes. This reduces the need for early replacements and associated waste generation.

# Second-Life Applications

We explore opportunities for reusing panels that are no longer suitable for primary use. For example, repurposing panels in non-critical applications.

Our subsidiary, TNB Research Sdn. Bhd. (TNBR), continuously seeks solutions to enhance solar PV circularity potential. TNBR has developed the Pilot Recycling System for PVs, which uses thermal treatment for material separation, supported by an optimised heat recovery design. The system is able to separate the PV samples into material components of clean glass, silicon wafer, metal and other recyclable resources.

By embracing these circular economy principles, we aim to establish a closed-loop system for solar energy, effectively minimising waste and environmental impact while fostering a more sustainable future.

In managing the battery lifecycle, we actively benchmark best practices and collaborate with industry partners to:

- Optimise battery performance  
Explore innovative second-life applications  
- Minimise environmental impact through responsible recycling

![](images/ec8c0247026d7bee0a9a7f1697e07b04ff249068f48f96c46e1443d1b538b836.jpg)  
TNB launched the Uniforms and Fabrics Recycling Campaign with more than 100 tonnes of recycled waste collected by end of 2024.

We have also intensified collaboration with vendors who are capable, licensed, and have vast experience in recycling and recovery to process our waste batteries.

Our commitment to responsible end-of-life solar and battery management extends beyond environmental considerations and encompasses minimising waste while educating stakeholders on sustainable practices.

# Responsible Effluent Management

In mitigating legal and operational risks and ensuring that effluents meet quality standards to protect public health and the environment, we have developed the Industrial Effluent Treatment System (IETS) Management Guideline.

Industrial effluent treatment systems are fundamental in managing wastewater generated by TNB to safeguard the environment and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. These systems encompass various stages and processes designed to remove contaminants from the effluent before its safe discharge into the environment.

# Non-Hazardous Waste Management

Our non-hazardous waste management complies with the Solid Waste and Public Cleansing Management Act 2007 (Act 672) and regulations set by the Jabatan Pengurusan Sisa Pepejal Negara (JPSPN). We are taking a phased approach towards improving our non-hazardous waste management. In 2023, we introduced the Tenaga Solid Waste Inventory (TESWI) to streamline data collection and monitoring of non-hazardous waste generation, promoting waste separation and recycling practices.

In 2024, 958 tonnes of non-hazardous waste were generated, with garden waste as the largest category, followed by mixed waste, residual waste, paper waste and bulk waste. Of the total, 831.09 tonnes (86.8%) were disposed, while 126.91 tonnes (13.2%) were recycled. With data analysis and identification of key waste streams, we can pinpoint opportunities for targeted reduction and recycling efforts.

Initiatives such as source segregation, on-site composting and sustainable landscaping to transform waste into valuable resources are being explored to support our circular economy goals.

# Uniforms and Fabrics Recycling Campaign

TNB launched the Uniforms and Fabrics Recycling Campaign in August 2024, targeting 75 tonnes of fabric collection by July 2025 across 135 locations in celebration of its 75th anniversary. This initiative promotes fabric waste recycling practices. By December 2024, the campaign had exceeded expectations, achieving 102.08 tonnes (136% of the target), with 89.86 tonnes (88%) from general fabrics and 12.23 tonnes (12%) from TNB uniforms. With strong participation and continued support from employees, TNB is making significant strides in reducing fabric waste and embedding a culture of recycling, and we strive to continue the recycling initiative.

# ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

In 2024, we faced penalties for non-compliance with the Environmental Quality (Scheduled Waste) Regulations 2005 and Environmental Quality (Industrial Effluent) Regulations 2009. We took full responsibility and swiftly settled all fines through immediate engagement with the DOE to prevent recurrence. We continue to implement corrective and preventive actions to ensure strict adherence to environmental regulations and to uphold the highest standards of compliance in our operations.

In 2024, the number of compounds received had reduced compared to the previous year as a result of rigorous inspections, internal audits and proactive self-regulation efforts aimed at achieving full compliance.

# Community Development and Social Impact

Since our inception 75 years ago, we have been a part of nation-building, contributing to national and community growth. We believe that as a responsible organisation, it is a part of our responsibility to give back to the communities, providing opportunities for them to improve their lives and well-being.

We aim to drive progress with positive social impact to the community by allocating  $1 \%$ of our Profit After Tax towards community development in social, education, environmental and sports. We continue to effectively engage with stakeholders to ensure our community development programmes create value and enhance social impact for responsible and sustainable growth. We are driven by our tagline “Better World. Brighter Lives.” towards brightening lives in Malaysia and beyond.

As a key driver of Malaysia's Energy Transition, we are dedicated to a just and inclusive transition, ensuring no one is left behind.

# MANAGEMENT APPROACH

In 2024, TNB invested over RM63 million in community programmes, strategically directed across four key focus areas: Social, Education, Environment and Sports. This dedicated funding underscores our commitment to making a positive impact on communities.

![](images/787e0de1f275d2e484c471825646070ef24ed9bf708061dec40792e7fe270c2d.jpg)  
In FY2024, TNB has contributed RM0.5 million to Home for the Needy programme.

# SOCIAL

# Home for the Needy

Through our Home for the Needy programme, we have successfully provided 962 homes supporting 962 families, primarily from the B40 and underprivileged communities, including differently-abled individuals, senior citizens and single parents. In 2024, we continue to refurbish and build new homes for underprivileged families, an investment amounting to RM0.5 million.

# Rural Electrification Programme

Through the Rural Electrification Programme (Bekalan Elektrik Luar Bandar) carried out in collaboration with the Ministry of Rural and Regional Development, TNB facilitates the electrification of rural regions, encompassing remote villages and indigenous people settlements. Where feasible, these areas are connected to the national grid. Otherwise, off-grid solutions are deployed including solar hybrids, generator sets and mini-hydro systems.

# Village Street Lighting Programme

Since 2002, TNB has been collaborating with the Government in the Village Street Lighting programme, with the aim to illuminate public areas in remote villages, improving community safety. In 2024, a total of 14,210 units of village streetlights were successfully installed at a total cost of RM39.91 million.

# Program Satu Pemimpin Satu Kampung (Santuni Madani)

The TNB's Group Executive Committee (GEC) members are empowered to further engage adopted villages to suggest solutions on socioeconomic problems in order to support infrastructure development and improve the well-being of the local community, aligned to the government's Santuni Madani programme. With its objectives of caring leadership, fostering sense of belonging and promoting sustainability engagements, TNB has contributed over RM31,000 by the end of December 2024 and will continue the effort beyond 2024.

# Engaging Indigenous People (Orang Asli)

TNB actively engages with Orang Asli communities living near our operation sites and implements targeted initiatives to improve their well-being and socioeconomic conditions and address grievances. Specifically for resettled Orang Asli communities, a variety of community engagement activities and resilience-building programmes are implemented to promote community cohesion and well-being, including:

Income Restoration and Upliftment: Providing land for rubber and fruit plantations, alongside training for upskilling and reskilling to enhance productivity and employability.  
02 Housing: Providing new houses of approximately 800 square feet per house.  
Infrastructure and Amenities: Providing essential infrastructure including electricity supply, healthcare facilities, clean water supply, and schools.  
04 Grievance Management: Engagements to address grievances are held regularly to ensure timely responses to concerns raised.

At the Nenggiri Hydroelectric Project site, the Social Impact Management Plan (SIMP) and Resettlement Action Plan have been initiated for the benefit of approximately 243 households comprising more than 1,200 individuals. These plans include physical development cost of resettlement area, cash compensation, and resettlement management costs, which currently amount to over RM59 million. TNB also invests over RM3.5 million in social impact and skills development programmes focusing on job and skills training, including financial literacy and other soft skills programmes for the Orang Asli communities.

# EDUCATION

We aim to transform individuals and their families through the power of education by promoting accessible, high-quality educational opportunities and by educating Malaysians on their role in managing energy efficiently.

# Ceria Ke Sekolah Programme (CKS)

Annually, we organise the CKS programme to provide primary school students from low-income families with adequate school supplies such as school uniform, school bags and shoes. In 2024, we contributed RM0.7 million to this programme, which benefited 6,640 students.

# Yayasan Tenaga Nasional (YTN)

At YTN, we sponsor students at the higher education level, both locally and internationally, through scholarships and convertible loans. In 2024, we contributed over RM41.5 million to support 1,582 students, with a particular focus on those from the underprivileged group through the My Brighter Future (MyBF) programme.

# Better Brighter Internship

TNB offers internship opportunities to students from higher learning institutions, providing them with valuable workplace exposure, thereby enhancing their employability upon graduation. In 2024, a total of 559 students interned in TNB and 2 were eventually employed by TNB.

# Graduate and Apprentice Programmes

We have been driving talent development through our PROTÉGÉ - Ready to Work Programme, which aims to tackle two key challenges in the country: reducing graduate unemployment and developing a skilled workforce for Malaysia's growing energy sector. This initiative is implemented through a hybrid learning model that combines theoretical knowledge with practical application. Since the launch of the SLIM/Protege programme at TNB back in 2011, a total of 6,610 trainees have been successfully trained, of which 546 trainees have been absorbed into TNB and its subsidiaries. Under the PROTÉGE Phase 8 intake (spanning between December 2022 till July 2024), TNB has trained over 500 trainees. TNB's commitment and achievement in supporting this nation building initiative was recognised by Kementerian Pembangunan Usahawan dan Koperasi (KUSKOP) Malaysia.

# Cultivate Sustainability and Environmental Awareness Among Youth

TNB in collaboration with Universiti Tenaga Nasional (UNITEN), co-organised the "Debat Alam Sekitar" organised by the Department of Environment Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability, a debate competition involving higher education institutions across Malaysia. The debate competition enabled students to engage in meaningful discussions on pressing environmental challenges supported by data and research, enhancing their understanding and commitment to sustainability.

Commemorating our  $75^{\text {th }}$  anniversary, we launched a sustainability-themed video competition titled “Sustainability Superheroes: Your Journey, Our Future”. University students participated in this competition, which aimed to raise awareness on sustainability practices. Participants were encouraged to showcase innovative ideas, personal contributions, or community- driven projects that promote ESG values.

Our involvement in these events underscores our dedication to cultivating environmental awareness among youth, fostering a new generation of environmentally conscious leaders.

# Sustainable & Responsible Supply Chain

In our commitment to driving a sustainable future, our procurement and supply chain approach focuses on embedding responsible, transparent, and ethical practices across the entire supply chain ecosystem. We have embarked on a sustainable supply chain approach that goes beyond traditional procurement, emphasising sustainability at every stage. We endeavour to apply a rigorous Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) lens to all our operations, ensuring that we create lasting value while minimising negative impacts.

Guided by the TNB Procurement & Supply Chain Policy & Procedure, we continue to pursue best-value procurement practices that uphold ethical and transparent standards for our vendors, partners, and contractors. Through the TNB Code of Business Ethics (COBE) and the TNB Sustainable Procurement Code of Conduct (SPCC), we maintain a strong commitment to ethical dealings that support a fair and responsible supply chain.

In 2024, we continued to advance our sustainability journey by promoting environmental stewardship, social responsibility and robust governance throughout our supply chain. Our efforts contribute to building a resilient, inclusive and sustainable future for Malaysia and beyond.

In 2024, TNB recorded a substantial procurement expenditure of approximately RM36.37 billion, reflecting a consistent trajectory and underscoring our role in supporting Malaysia's economy.

Our procurement spend includes:

- Fuel-Related Expenditures: Approximately RM23.2 billion of our spend was dedicated to fuel, primarily locally sourced natural gas and internationally sourced coal, which are essential for power generation. By balancing local and international sources, TNB ensures a reliable energy supply to meet the nation's demands.  
Non-Fuel Expenditures: Non-fuel procurement spending amounted to RM13.15 billion, with around  $95\%$  sourced from local suppliers. This local focus reinforces our dedication to supporting Malaysian businesses across various industries and enhances the resilience of our supply chain.

Our commitment to local sourcing is reflected in  $52.81\%$  of our total procurement spend in 2024. This strengthens the Malaysian economy and aligns with our goal of building a supply chain that benefits local communities and businesses.

# SUSTAINABLE PROCEDURE CODE OF CONDUCT (SPCC)

The TNB Sustainable Procurement Code of Conduct (SPCC), introduced in 2024, outlines a framework for ethical and responsible procurement practices, setting standards that vendors must adhere to. Any non-compliance could lead to penalties, including contract suspension or termination. By setting clear guidelines for environmental responsibility, labour rights and health and safety standards, SPCC ensures our vendors meet ethical requirements and our commitment to TNB's ESG goals.

Code of Conduct for Vendors

# Whistleblowing and Grievance Reporting

The SPCC includes provisions for whistleblowing, allowing vendors and employees to report unethical practices anonymously. TNB ensures the confidentiality of whistleblowers and actions are taken accordingly.

# FACILITATING OPEN DIALOGUES AND GRIEVANCE MANAGEMENT

TNB fosters open, transparent, and effective communication with key stakeholders and vendor associations including Persatuan Rakan Niaga Strategik Malaysia (PERNISMA), Persatuan Usahawan Tenaga Malaysia (PUTM), Gagasan Profesional Melayu Malaysia (GPMM), Persatuan Industri Tenaga Boleh Baharu dan Alam Sekitar (PINTARE) through various channels. These include face-to-face engagements such as the Business Partnership Retreat and Opportunity Day, Procurement Cycle Digitalisation (PCD) Rangers for e-tendering support and the Sistem Maklum balas Bahan platform. Regular Vendor Satisfaction Surveys are conducted as feedback for Vendor Grievance Management.

# SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURES ON MATERIAL MATTERS

# MM9: Sustainable & Responsible Supply Chain

Furthermore, our commitment to accountability is evident in our enhanced Vendor Grievance Procedure, which ensures a streamlined, centralised approach to handling grievances that allows for anonymous reporting to uphold impartiality and integrity.

# Vendor Grievance Management

The Vendor Grievance Management aims to uphold integrity, fair labour, and sustainability within the supply chain by providing clear steps for addressing grievances and promoting transparency. It is guided by TNB's core values, such as integrity, professionalism, and collaboration, ensuring a respectful, accountable, and open environment for vendors and stakeholders. The vendor grievance procedure includes accessible grievance channels, a dedicated committee for fair evaluation, and ongoing support for vendors to drive continuous improvement and uphold ethical standards.

# VENDOR COLLABORATION ECOSYSTEM

Together with our vendors, we collaborate to strengthen the supply chain ecosystem towards greater transparency and efficiency. This includes enhancing vendor performance and capabilities, and facilitating open dialogue.

# Enhancing Vendor Performance

The Contractor Assessment and Supplier Evaluation (CASE) system facilitates transparent evaluation of vendor performance, helping vendors to continually improve in providing quality products and services. This commitment to excellence strengthens our partnerships and supports a culture of continuous improvement throughout our supply chain.

# Elevating Vendor Capability Training and Development

TNB is committed to equipping our vendors with the knowledge and skills necessary to remain relevant and competitive in an evolving industry landscape. By offering a range of targeted training and development programmes, we support through programmes that build capabilities and aligning them to our stringent quality and safety standards.

These programmes include competency certification schemes such as Orang Kompeten Suruhanjaya Tenaga, technical competencies such as Kad Kelayakan Teknikal and ESG awareness and training.

# Creating Opportunities for Local Vendors

We recognise our role in bolstering the local value chain ecosystem. In 2024, we continue to promote business matching activities to offer opportunities for new business and collaboration.

- Data analysis & matching: Through open advertisement, we identify potential vendors with sound prospects and strong track records who are assessed and matched to identified opportunities.  
- **Matchmaking events:** TNB organises and participates in matchmaking events that expand our supplier base and fosters new partnerships, including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). These initiatives promote opportunities for local suppliers to be integrated into the value chain, contributing to economic growth and social impact.

Stakeholder collaboration: We work closely with industry associations, government-linked companies, and relevant stakeholders to engage with suppliers who are dedicated to responsible business practices and sustainable growth.

# Creating Opportunities for our Local Vendors through Bumiputera Vendor Development Programme 3.0 (PV 3.0)

TNB's vendor development programme has been in place since 1994. After more than 30 years of implementation, it has been reviewed, in line with the NETR and the Government's Bumiputera economic agenda. Subsequently, the existing programme was enhanced by introducing a new framework to support TNB's business needs in the energy transition landscape and to realise the Government's aspiration in driving the Bumiputera Economic Transformation Plan 2035 (PuTERA35).

This programme comprises 731 Bumiputera Contractors, and 26 manufacturers (operating under the Bumiputera Spend Share Policy), further reinforcing our dedication to economic inclusivity and supporting the national Bumiputera Spend Share initiative.

The PV 3.0 plays a vital role in driving Bumiputera participation in the energy sector in alignment with NETR (National Energy Transition Roadmap), offering opportunities in energy transition, green technologies and digital solutions. With a local procurement target to steadily increase from  $47.8\%$  (in 2024) of total TNB procurement spending to  $55\%$  by 2030, PV 3.0 aims to foster long-term market growth and create more than 1,700 Bumiputera vendors by 2030.

TNB is dedicated to enhancing the competitiveness of Bumiputera contractors by facilitating joint ventures with high-tech companies, supporting participation in international trade missions, and providing a comprehensive platform under PV 3.0 that encourages business expansion and skill development. TNB assists vendors to access green financing and collaboration opportunities in flagship projects within the energy sector, while driving innovation and technological advancements.

Through these efforts, TNB ensures that the Bumiputera economic agenda remains aligned with the principles of the MADANI Economy, promoting sustainability through NETR, encouraging innovation, and fostering inclusive development with programmes such as TVET Learn To Work.

# ENHANCING SUPPLY CHAIN EFFICIENCY THROUGH DIGITALISATION AND INNOVATION

We recognise digitalisation as a crucial enabler in transforming our supply chain for enhanced efficiency, resilience and sustainability. Digitalisation allows us to respond more effectively to changing market demands, optimise inventory management and reduce lead times.

# Cybersecurity Management

Digitalisation is a catalyst in enabling our energy transition journey, and is rapidly gaining importance in our operations, assisting us in enhancing customer and employee experiences. As cyber threats increase in sophistication, frequency and impact, we continue to act with an integrated approach, leveraging people, technologies and processes to reduce our cyber risk exposure. To this end, we ensure that we safeguard our Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) systems, protecting customer privacy and stakeholders' data, while providing a reliable and secure electricity supply to the nation.

We diligently conduct risk assessments to foresee exposures related to cyber threats and data security. With the oversight of TNB BOD and commitment from the management, mitigation measures are implemented to address exposures.

Our cybersecurity management is developed to protect system and data confidentiality, integrity and availability in addition to securing our IT and OT systems. Apart from implementing initiatives to safeguard the data privacy of our 10.41 million customers, we comply with the relevant cybersecurity and personal data protection laws, and industry best practices.

Our cybersecurity management for Information and Communications Technology (ICT) adheres to the TNB ICT Security Policy and Code of Practice, ensuring all employees understand their roles in protecting our ICT assets. Through 24-hour cyber threat monitoring, we safeguard the security of the national grid to ensure a reliable electricity supply.

# CYBERSECURITY AWARENESS THROUGH TRAINING

Cybersecurity awareness programmes are implemented across the Group through multiple learning modalities, including e-learning modules, newsletters, and hybrid engagement sessions. Employees across all organisational levels are equipped with knowledge of cybersecurity risks and mitigation strategies. This educational framework extends beyond internal stakeholders to encompass contractors and vendors, ensuring a uniform approach to cybersecurity awareness across our entire operational ecosystem.

# DATA PROTECTION MANAGEMENT

TNB is committed to safeguarding data subjects' personal data in accordance with the Personal Data Protection Act 2010 (PDPA), Personal Data Protection Code of Practice for The Utilities Sector (Electricity) Version 2.0 and other relevant internal policies, guidelines and circulars for the processing and handling of data subjects' personal data. Additionally, TNB places a high priority on personal data protection, ensuring that our customers personal data is managed with the utmost care and in full compliance with the relevant laws and regulations including a comprehensive Personal Data Protection (PDP) Policy. The PDP Policy is also applicable to TNB's subsidiaries.

# CUSTOMER DATA MANAGEMENT OUR PRIORITY

We facilitate customer data management through Data Access and Correction Request Forms, whereby our customers can easily make requests to access or rectify their personal data in the event of any inaccuracies. A structured data retention framework is implemented, aligned with corporate policies and contractual agreements, whereby data is maintained only for the duration necessary to protect stakeholder interests whilst ensuring compliance with legislative requirements.

In addressing the demands of global digital integration, we implement security protocols, including identity verification mechanisms to safeguard customer privacy within TNB's ecosystem. We maintain stringent controls over international data transfers to external entities, including our service providers and business partners. These external entities are bound by contractual obligations that mandate equivalent data protection standards and restrict data utilisation exclusively to agreed-upon services.

TNB via its Cyber Security Operating Model (CSOM) has taken proactive and reactive measures in safeguarding our data from breaches or leakages via robust data governance such as the Enterprise Data Governance (EDG) initiative, emulating best practices through international certifications (ISO27001 and PCI DSS), technology controls and 24x7 strict monitoring by our Security Operation Centre (SOC). However, in the event of data breach or leaks, our incident response plan will ensure that TNB can swiftly contain the incident and protect the affected entities involved.

TNB practices a strict onboarding and offboarding policy for employees and contractors, guided by international cybersecurity standards, i.e. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). We adopt best practices and leverage on advanced technology to ensure secure onboarding and offboarding experience for our employees and contractors.

TNB maintains continuous PDPA compliance through systematic implementation of regular training programmes and awareness sessions across TNB and its subsidiaries. Annual observational audits of personal data protection practices are conducted at designated premises to ensure adherence to the PDPA. Additionally, TNB also implements PDPA e-learning initiative with the identified business units in TNB based on operational needs.

TNB actively engages with the Personal Data Protection Commissioner's Office (PDP Commissioner's Office) to establish good working relationships, seek guidance and actively participate in discussion. TNB also proactively provides comprehensive feedback on the PDPA amendments and Public Consultation Papers issued by the PDP Commissioner's Office. This collaborative relationship facilitates informed guidance and strategic direction for personal data protection initiatives.

For any enquiries or concerns regarding the administration of customer personal data related to electricity supply, we encourage our customers to reach out to our dedicated Customer Care team. Additionally, for matters related to TNB PDP Policy, our designated Data Protection Officer team is readily available to address any concerns.

# OUR BUSINESS RESILIENCE AGAINST THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE

Proactive steps are being taken to ensure the resilience of our business operations and assets against acute and chronic physical risks resulting from climate change. Our climate risk assessment considers the scenarios based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), as follows:

<table><tr><td>IPCC/NGFS Scenario</td><td>NGFS-Net Zero Scenario</td><td>NGFS-NDC Scenario</td><td>IPCC RCP-6.0: Moderate Emissions Scenario</td><td>IPCC RCP-8.5: High Emissions Scenario</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td>An ambitious scenario that limits global warming to 1.5°C through stringent climate policies and innovation, reaching Net Zero CO2 emissions around 2050</td><td>The NDC scenario includes all pledged policies, even if not yet implemented, based on the trajectory associated with global NDC commitments to limit the impact of climate change</td><td>The scenario suggests a future in which greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise at a moderate rate but stabilise by 2070</td><td>The &#x27;Business as usual&#x27; scenario suggests a likely outcome if society does not make a concerted effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions</td></tr><tr><td>Temperature Increase</td><td>1.5°C - 2.0°C by 2100</td><td>2.3°C - 4.5°C by 2100</td><td>2.6°C - 5.7°C by 2100</td><td>&gt;4.0°C by 2100</td></tr></table>

In 2024, we undertook a comprehensive climate risk assessment at the asset level to gain deeper insights into climate-related threats. This approach has enabled us to strengthen the resilience of our assets by implementing targeted, effective, and sustainable adaptation measures.

# OUR RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE

We integrate climate data from agencies such as the Malaysian Meteorological Department, National Disaster Agency, or National Disaster Management Agency (NADMA) and the National Water Research Institute of Malaysia (NAHRIM) with our internal Geographic Information System (GIS). This integration allows us to identify climate hazards to our asset on comprehensive maps, giving us a clearer understanding of the potential impacts of climate change on our operations, particularly concerning floods (riverine and surface water), extreme winds, and extreme heat whilst concurrently exploring assessments for other climate hazards.

Soil Movement

# Floods (Riverine & Surface Water)

Malaysia is exposed to monsoon rains, particularly from November to March. Low-lying areas, especially along the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia, are highly vulnerable. Flooding can damage critical infrastructure, leading to power outages and costly repairs. Substations and transformers are particularly at risk, as water ingress can cause short circuits and equipment failure. Additionally, access to affected areas can be hindered, delaying repair and restoration efforts.

# Extreme Heat

Extreme heat impacts our physical asset in various ways. Solar assets may operate sub-optimally in high temperatures or with insufficient sunlight, thus reducing output. For thermal power plants, rising ambient temperatures decrease gas power plant efficiency and increase fuel costs. Additionally, extreme heat may affect grid system reliability, particularly at substations, due to overloading and thermal stress (hotspots).

# Extreme Wind

Our assets, particularly transmission and distribution networks' lattice towers and service poles, as well as solar power plants are vulnerable to extreme wind. Extreme winds can cause the collapse of lattice towers, uprooting of poles, dislodge or break solar panels, leading to costly repairs and downtime.

# Sea Inundation

Our coastal assets are at significant risk due to rising sea levels. Seawater intrusion can contaminate freshwater supplies and corrode infrastructure. Submersion during high tides and storms can cause extensive damage, while prolonged exposure to saltwater accelerates metal erosion and compromises structural integrity.

Based on our analysis, majority of our physical assets are at low risk, reflecting their resilience:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">Physical Risk</td><td rowspan="2">Asset Type</td><td colspan="4">% of Asset Based on Risk Exposure Level</td></tr><tr><td>High</td><td>Significant</td><td>Medium</td><td>Low</td></tr><tr><td>Flood (Riverine &amp; Surface Water)</td><td>HV, MV &amp; LV substations, power plants (Coal, Gas, Hydro), large-scale solar power plants</td><td>0.05%</td><td>1.03%</td><td>14.97%</td><td>83.95%</td></tr><tr><td>Extreme Heat</td><td>HV, MV &amp; LV substations</td><td>0.06%</td><td>0.20%</td><td>4.93%</td><td>94.81%</td></tr><tr><td>Extreme Wind</td><td>HV, MV &amp; LV substations, power plants (Coal, Gas), large-scale solar power plants, HV Overhead Lines</td><td>0.00%</td><td>0.01%</td><td>41.67%</td><td>58.32%</td></tr><tr><td>Sea Inundation</td><td>HV, MV &amp; LV substations, power plants (Coal, Gas, Hydro), large-scale solar power plants</td><td>0.00%</td><td>0.00%</td><td>4.80%</td><td>95.2%</td></tr></table>

# CLIMATE ADAPTATION MEASURES

Proactive adaptation and mitigation measures have been implemented over the years. Through early and ongoing investments in climate resilience, many of our assets have been upgraded to withstand climate-related challenges, which have significantly reduced their vulnerability to potential climate impacts. Several adaptation measures for flood (riverine and surface water), extreme heat and extreme wind are highlighted as follows:

<table><tr><td>Physical Risk</td><td>TNB Adaptation Measures</td></tr><tr><td>Flood</td><td>·Conduct asset-level flood risk assessments to identify vulnerable assets
·Implement flood mitigations such as elevating asset structure, installation of flood barrier for identified asset within flood-prone area
·Develop and implement flood response plan, including shutdown procedures, dam water release procedure, followed by rapid response from Emergency Response Team (ERT)
·Collaborate with local communities, governments, and other stakeholders to ensure prompt and coordinated responses
·Implement Integrated Community-Based Disaster Management (ICBDM) programme
·Secure adequate insurance coverage for flood-related damages</td></tr><tr><td>Extreme Heat</td><td>·Conduct asset-level extreme risk assessments to identify vulnerable assets
·Incorporate climate change factors into new site assessments and adopt new design standards considering projected increasing extreme heat, e.g., increase equipment rating to mitigate over loading/hotspot
·Implement demand response programmes to manage peak load during extreme heat event
·Promote energy efficiency programmes to reduce overall demand during heat waves</td></tr><tr><td>Extreme Wind</td><td>·Conduct asset-level wind risk assessments to identify vulnerable asset
·Strengthen infrastructure such as enhance tower safety factor to withstand extreme wind, switch from electric poles to underground cable, etc
·Develop and regularly update emergency response plans for extreme wind events
·Implement vegetation management, e.g., removal of dangerous tree to keep trees and branches away from power lines</td></tr><tr><td>Sea Inundation</td><td>·Conduct asset-level sea inundation risk assessments to identify vulnerable asset
·Implement routine maintenance of corroded asset which includes regular inspections, repairs and upgrades of material that are resistant to saltwater corrosion</td></tr></table>

# RISK MANAGEMENT

We integrate the assessment of transition risks and opportunities into our comprehensive risk management strategy, guided by our TNB Risk Management Framework. The management of climate-related physical and transition risk, including assessment, review and monitoring are embedded in our business operations and decisions regarding business growth, enabling us to navigate challenges effectively while seizing opportunities for a sustainable future.

(Refer to the SORMIC in page 219)

We recognise the importance of cultivating cross-functional capabilities and enhancing resilience across all areas of our business to support long-term strategic decision-making. Key capabilities include foresight and crisis preparedness. To achieve this, we employ a 4+1 approach—scan, assess, identify, mitigate, and repeat—allowing us to continuously monitor potential issues, evaluate their impacts, pinpoint specific risks, implement effective mitigation strategies, and iterate the process to stay ahead of emerging threats and prevent crises.

# OUR RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE

# BUSINESS CONTINUITY MANAGEMENT (BCM)

In the event of a crisis, we are fully committed to preparing and responding effectively, guided by the TNB Corporate Business Continuity Management (BCM) Framework. Developed in alignment with ISO 22301, our BCM Framework provides a structured approach to managing business continuity within the Group. This enables us to respond quickly and effectively to any crisis while ensuring the continuity of our operations towards greater resilience.

Across the Group, proactive pre-crisis preparedness is continually emphasised to prevent crisis from occurring or becoming more severe. For instance, in preparation for floods during monsoon season, a range of crisis preparedness measures is proactively taken, including:

# 01

Flood forecasts are generated using Flood Inundation Maps, Substation Elevation data, and Contour Gap Analysis. Based on these forecasts, warning alerts are issued to the operations team to enhance preparedness.

# 02

Review and enhancement of Business Impact Analysis (BIA) and Emergency Response Plans (ERP).

# 03

Identification and implementation of flood mitigations on asset infrastructure.

# 04

Communication and engagement with local authorities and state governments aim to strengthen a prompt and coordinated response during crises.

Our crisis management is led by the TNB Crisis Management Team (CMT), which includes the President/CEO and C-Suites, playing a vital role in ensuring efficient recovery and effective communication with stakeholders. At the operations level, Emergency Response Teams (ERT) activate respective ERP for immediate response such as medical care and rescue operations, prioritising the safety of both our assets and those affected. We strategically plan and execute stakeholder communications through official channels, including the TNB Caroline Facebook page. Additionally, targeted engagements with stakeholders are led by TNB State Stakeholder Affairs or Head of Retail at the state to strengthen stakeholder confidence during a crisis.

# METRICS AND TARGET

We identify and set climate-related quantitative targets and monitor related metrics to ensure the realisation of our Net Zero by 2050 aspiration.

# Dear Shareholders,

On behalf of the Board of Directors, it is my pleasure to present the Corporate Governance Overview Statement (CG Overview) for the year 2024. As Chairman of the Board, I am committed to uphold the highest standards of corporate governance and to ensure the Board fulfils its fiduciary duties and responsibilities to the shareholders as well as our broad group of stakeholders.

The Board recognises the intrinsic value and importance of robust corporate governance framework and its role in supporting the long-term success and sustainable growth of our business. Sound corporate governance practices serve as a cornerstone for driving shareholder value, fostering business integrity, instilling investors' confidence and realising the Group's corporate objectives and vision.

Amidst an increasingly challenging business environment, the Board is committed to strengthening the Group's corporate governance practices and processes to effectively meet growing business needs.

This CG Overview sets out the governance structures and procedures in place and summarises activities of the Board and its Committees in discharging their responsibilities during the Financial Year under review. The strength of the Board's leadership is assessed through the clarity of the actions it takes and transparency according to the prescribed standards, policies and processes.

This CG Overview also provides vital insights into the corporate governance of TNB which is guided by the principles and best practices encapsulated in the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance 2021 (MCCG) by the Securities Commission of Malaysia (SC). This CG Overview is prepared in accordance with the Main Market Listing Requirements of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad (MMLR) and is to be read together with the Corporate Governance Report 2024 which is accessible on our corporate website at www.tnb.com.my.

Notably, in 2024, after a series of discussion, the Board on 30 August 2024 had approved the Reimagining TNB 2.0 (RT 2.0) strategy framework and way forward, an important strategic document developed with the aim of enabling Malaysia's energy transition journey and achieving the 2030 Earnings Before Interest And Taxes (EBIT) and Profit After Tax (PAT) targets.

# BOARD COMPOSITION

Our Board currently comprises six (6) Independent Non-Executive Directors, five (5) Non-Independent Non-Executive Directors and one (1) Non-Independent Executive Director, to ensure balanced oversight and strategic guidance of the Company. The Board composition adheres to Paragraph 15.02 (1)(a) of the MMLR having  $50\%$  of Independent Directors, surpassing the requirements set by the MMLR.

The Board is committed in maintaining a diverse mix of skills, experience and expertise to effectively fulfill its duties and responsibilities as well as to address the dynamic landscape ahead. The Board has currently four (4) women members (constituting  $33\%$ ), exceeding the requirement as prescribed by the MMLR and the  $30\%$  benchmark recommended by MCCG.

With primary focus on Board succession planning, we have streamlined a robust process for selecting, nominating and appointing candidates to the Board. The Board Nomination and Remuneration Committee (BNRC) is entrusted to evaluate the potential candidates, in respect of their capabilities, expertise, experience, fit and proper, commitment as well as suitability for the Board and Committees' roles in order to suit the need to further strengthen the Board's dynamic and to achieve a well-rounded composition of Board members.

Several changes within the Board took place in the course of the Financial Year, of which include the resignation of Dato' Roslina binti Zainal as Independent Non-Executive Director effective 13 May 2024, to pursue other interest and the appointment of Alan Hamzah Sendut, an Independent Non-Executive Director with effect from 2 December 2024.

With his wealth of knowledge and experience across multiple industries and companies in corporate strategy, corporate finance, business development as well as mergers and acquisitions, Alan Hamzah Sendut will contribute and facilitate the Board in making informed decisions.

On behalf of the Board, I would like to express our gratitude to Dato' Roslina binti Zainal for her unwavering dedication to the Company throughout her tenure of service. To Alan Hamzah Sendut, we welcome you to our organisation and we are confident that with your expertise, we will be able to continue steering TNB towards greater success.

The Board has brought together individuals from various backgrounds and cross-sectoral expertise in the fields of energy, finance and sustainability. By having a balanced blend of skills, experience and independence, the Board is confident of its ability to execute the Group's strategies effectively hence maximising value for the Company.

# BOARD EFFECTIVENESS

The annual Board Effectiveness Assessment (BEA) serves as a valuable mechanism for the Board to measure its effectiveness and identify areas of improvement and enhancement. The 2024 BEA was conducted internally and facilitated by the Company Secretary through

a set of online questionnaires. Save for Alan Hamzah Sendut and the Alternate Director, the rest of Directors participated in the assessment. Feedback of Top Management was also sought through this exercise.

Based on the overall findings, the Board continued to showcase strong and effective leadership in 2024. The Board on 24 March 2025, had approved the identified action plans as recommended by the BNRC, in order to close the gap and to ensure the Board remains effective in discharging its roles and duties for the Company.

# COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY

Our sustainability governance is an integral part of TNB's Governance Model that is aligned with the principles of MCCG. A strong sustainability governance and leadership structure are imperative to our sustainability agenda and will provide us with clear and definitive guidance to achieve our Net Zero 2050 aspiration.

Our sustainability governance is embedded in the TNB Group Governance Platform which defines the framework of TNB management committees and sub-committees. Having the Sustainability and Energy Transition Council (SETC) in place since 2022, has allowed for the oversight of energy transition initiatives and sustainability agenda across the organisation. The SETC ensures that these sustainability and energy transition initiatives are aligned with our overall strategic direction.

During the Financial Year under review, the Board, on 29 April 2024, had approved TNB Sustainability Policy, TNB Sustainability Framework and TNB Sustainability Governance Document Approving Authority. The said policy reaffirms TNB's commitment to execute its sustainability and energy transition strategies, and further defines the approach to propel TNB to meet its Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) goals.

As we progress, we will continuously review and strengthen our governance practice to ensure adherence to guiding principles and relevant benchmarks.

# LOOKING AHEAD

In the year ahead, as we steadfastly pursue our strategic and sustainability goals, we will remain committed to fortifying the Group's governance framework. This will ensure that the Group's governance structure harmoniously aligns and upholds the principles of ethical behaviour, accountability, transparency and sustainability.

# TNB GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK

![](images/e28a7bf19bd6ea0a2ff40ef7b9870150967dafb9f424ca6334cbeff1cc1390de.jpg)

# THE TNB GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK ENSURES ORDERLY AND EFFECTIVE DISCHARGE OF THE BOARD'S ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES WHERE POWERS OF THE BOARD ARE DELEGATED TO THE RELEVANT BOARD COMMITTEES, THE PRESIDENT/CEO AND MANAGEMENT COMMITTEEES.

The Group prioritises good governance as fundamental to our long-term success, driven by our responsibility to shareholders and a broad group of stakeholders. The Board views corporate governance as a fundamental process contributing towards achieving long-term shareholders' value, taking into account the interests of all other stakeholders.

The Group believes therefore that a healthy corporate culture and robust governance framework ensures that the organisation continues to run smoothly and efficiently.

The TNB governance framework, its structure and processes, are built upon the Board's Charter, Terms of Reference (ToR) of the Board Committees which are complemented by Limits of Authority and supported by the various management committees, policies and procedures. These processes are monitored and oversee by the Internal and External Auditors.

The Framework ensures clarity of roles by clear demarcation of roles and accountabilities as well as recognises the independent roles and duties required to effectively govern the Company with specific powers of the Board delegated to the relevant Board Committees and the President/CEO.

The Board strives to ensure the Group's governance structure continues to remain appropriate and that it keeps abreast with relevant corporate governance and regulatory requirements. The structure and associated practices are reviewed when necessary to reflect the market and the communities within which the Group operates.

# SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE

In advancing our sustainability agenda and achieving our net zero objectives, a robust sustainability governance framework and strong leadership structure are paramount. Aligned with the tenets of the MCCG, our sustainability governance is deeply ingrained within TNB's Governance Model, serving as a cornerstone of our organisational principles.

Underlining the importance of a resilient sustainability governance framework, coupled with effective leadership, we uphold these elements as essential for informed and inclusive decision-making processes. Integrated seamlessly within the broader TNB Group Governance Platform, our sustainability governance framework is intricately linked with TNB's management committees and subcommittees, reinforcing its pivotal role within our corporate governance framework.

With the support of the BSRC, the Board assumes the responsibility for ensuring the robustness of our sustainability and risk management frameworks, as well as the effectiveness of their implementation in achieving strategic objectives and sustainability commitments.

The BAC shall provide assurance on sustainability-related matters that include ensuring the consistency and coherence of sustainability-related disclosures across financial reporting and other public disclosures, approving the assurance plan/ methodology on the Sustainability Statement and reviewing the

results of assurance on the Sustainability Statement, culminating in the approval of the Statement of Assurance as part of the Sustainability Statement.

The Board, based on the recommendation by BSRC, on 29 April 2024 had approved TNB Sustainability Policy, TNB Sustainability Framework and TNB Sustainability Governance Document Approving Authority. The said policy encompasses TNB's commitment to achieve its sustainability and energy transition strategies, and the approach to propel TNB or towards its Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) goals.

For more information, please refer to Sustainability Governance section of Sustainability Statement, which can be found on pages 61.

# OPERATIONS OF THE BOARD

Prior to each scheduled Board meeting, comprehensive Chairman Reports from the respective Board Committees are distributed, ensuring Directors are thoroughly briefed on deliberations and recommendations made at the respective Board Committees. This process guarantees that each Director is well-informed about decisions made and viewpoints raised. Subsequently, the Chairman of each Board Committee presents the Committee's report to the Board, outlining recommendations for the Board's consideration and approval. This dynamic exchange allows the Board to offer insights on all Committee deliberations. All deliberations and recommendations are duly recorded, approved or endorsed by each Board Committee and subsequently affirmed by the Chairman during their respective Board Committee meetings.

Under the guidance of the Chairman, the Board engages in transparent discussions on all matters presented. Regular insights and counsel are sought from Senior Executives within the Group, as well as external advisers when necessary, facilitating the Board's decision-making process. Throughout the review period, the Board delved into a diverse array of topics, fulfilling its obligations with discussions spanning strategy, sustainability and the operations of the Group, including its principal operating subsidiaries. Financial aspects, legal considerations, compliance, governance and risk management were also meticulously scrutinised.

Additionally, Board and Board Committee meetings are strategically held at various business operating units or major/new project sites to provide the Board with firsthand assessment of progress and to address any pertinent issues raised.

# BOARD COMPOSITION AND INDEPENDENCE

The Board has conducted a thorough review of the independence status of each Independent Non-Executive Director. Throughout the year, it was confirmed that none of the Independent Non-Executive Directors maintained significant business or other relationships with the Group. Moreover, no other factors were identified that could potentially compromise their independence of character and judgment, aligning with the guiding principles set forth in the MCCG and MMLR.

Recognising the paramount importance of independence characteristics delineated in the MCCG, the Board places significant emphasis on the duration of service when evaluating the independence of Independent Non-Executive Directors. As part of its governance framework, the Board strictly adheres to a tenure limit of nine (9) years for Independent Non-Executive Directors, without further extension, in accordance with Step Up 5.4 of the MCCG. Currently, none of the Independent Non-Executive Directors has exceeded the prescribed nine-year tenure.

During the Financial Year under review, a session was held on 16 December 2024 between the Senior Independent Director and the Independent Directors without the presence of the Management to address any concern or sensitive issue of the Board.

# BOARD LEADERSHIP & EFFECTIVENESS

# SUMMARY OF BOARD ACTIVITIES IN 2024

Material Matters Reserved for the Board

# Formulating, reviewing and approving the Company's strategic business plan

# Matters Considered by the Board

The Board assumes a critical role in overseeing the Company's strategic trajectory and sanctioning corporate strategic endeavours devised by the Management. Annually, the Board scrutinises the Company's strategic and business plan, including the proposed annual capital and revenue budget for the upcoming year, alongside the KPIs. This ensures that the KPIs align with the Company's annual strategic and business plan. The Board thoroughly evaluates and deliberates on the Management's perspectives and assumptions to ensure informed decisions are made, considering all relevant factors.

Additionally, an informal session known as the Board Breakout Session (BBO) serves as a platform for the Board and Management to exchange views and opinions, discuss strategic plans and address pertinent issues concerning the Group's direction and progress. Coordinated by the Company Secretary's Office, with input from respective Divisions, as required, the BBO facilitates strategic planning and progress reporting.

Throughout the Financial Year, the Board conducted two (2) BBOs:

- On 31 May 2024: Deliberations on the way forward of Single Buyer.  
- On 23 July 2024: RT2.0 strategy framework and target aspiration, update progress of RT2.0 delivery and setting RT2.0 way forward.

After a series of syndication, the Board on 30 August 2024 had approved the RT2.0 strategy framework and way forward that were developed with the aim of enabling Malaysia's energy transition journey and achieving the 2030 EBIT and PAT target.

Based on the evaluation for the Financial Year under review, the Board collectively affirmed its thorough review of the Company's strategic and financial plans, including the monitoring of implementation and KPI alignment to achieve corporate objectives.

# Material Matters Reserved for the Board

# Reviewing the adequacy and integrity of the Company's internal control system

# Matters Considered by the Board

The Board holds the responsibility of establishing and maintaining a robust reporting framework for internal controls and regulatory compliance across the Company.

Regular meetings were conducted to assess the effectiveness of the Company's internal control system, ensuring alignment with regulatory standards and best practices.

Following the evaluation of the Financial Year, the Board collectively affirmed its fulfilment of these responsibilities through the diligent efforts of the BAC and BSRC.

# Identifying and managing principal risks affecting the Company

# Matters Considered by the Board

The Board, through the BSRC, holds the mandate to oversee the strength of the Group's sustainability and risk management frameworks and the efficacy of their implementation to realise strategic objectives and sustainability commitments.

Throughout the Financial Year, the BSRC held 12 sittings, focusing on various aspects of sustainability and risk management. Deliberations included exposures on strategic business and sustainability risks monitored through forward-looking Key Risk Indicators that reflected the Group's risk appetite and key risks of TNB business entities, NETR projects, safety & health, legal, digitalisation and cyber security. With the BAC, the BSRC jointly endorsed the Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control, which encapsulates the Group's risk management practices and internal controls.

Through synergistic collaboration with business entities across the Group, the Chief Sustainability Officer and the Sustainability Division execute the Group's sustainability strategies and initiatives. The Chief Risk Officer leads the Risk Management Department and reports administratively to the Chief Sustainability Officer. This integration ensures alignment between risk management and sustainability efforts.

The Risk Management Department ensures the effective implementation of the TNB Risk Management Framework, aligned with ISO 31000:2018, to facilitate informed decision-making.

The BSRC remains committed in its oversight role, ensuring that risk management is seamlessly integrated into strategic planning and decision-making processes to drive the Group's strategic outcomes and long-term objectives.

Based on the evaluation for the Financial Year under review, the Board collectively agreed that it has discharged its roles in identifying principal risks and in ensuring that the Group has put in place an adequate risk management framework to effectively monitor and manage the risks of its operational businesses for the Company's sustainability.

# Overseeing and evaluating the conduct and performance of the Company's businesses

# Matters Considered by the Board

The President/CEO assumes the crucial role of overseeing the Company's day-to-day operations and executing Group strategies and policies approved by the Board. This responsibility is facilitated by the dedicated support of various Management Committees. Performance evaluations of Management are conducted, primarily assessing the quarterly Company's and Group's financial performance. The Board receives regular updates on the status of Company's strategic initiatives, key operational concerns and the Group's performance, all aligned with approved KPIs.

# Material Matters Reserved for the Board

# Succession Planning

# Matters Considered by the Board

The Board, assisted by the BNRC, is responsible for developing plans to identify the necessary and desirable competencies and skills of Directors and succession plans to ensure there is appropriate dynamics of skills competencies, experience, expertise and diversity on the Board. In addition, the Board/BNRC also oversees the appointment and succession planning of the Top Management.

The selection of candidates and appointment of Independent Non-Executive Director by the Board/BNRC are made with the assistance of independent consultant, whenever necessary.

During the Financial Year under review, there were several movements to the Board. This includes the resignation of Dato' Roslina binti Zainal as Independent Non-Executive Director, effective 13 May 2024. A new addition to the Board, Alan Hamzah Sendut, an Independent Non-Executive Director was appointed with effect from 2 December 2024, as approved by the Board on 28 November 2024. The appointment process was made with the assistance of an independent consultant.

With his breadth of knowledge and experience across multiple industries and companies which involved in motor and heavy equipment distribution, manufacturing, plantations, corporate services, corporate strategy, corporate finance, business development and mergers and acquisitions, will assist the Board in making informed decisions.

The BNRC, with the approval of the Board, had streamlined a structured appointment process for the Board during the Financial Year.

In this process, the BNRC develops and finalises the Key Success Profile for Director having considered the current Board Skills Matrix, the essential skills, experience, age, ethnicity, gender and other relevant criteria required to drive the strategic direction of the Company, with the aim of closing the gap and to further strengthen the Board's composition.

The BNRC identifies and reviews the potential candidates which are sourced internally and through external/independent sources with reference to the Key Success Profile. The suitability, availability, conflict & potential interest and fit and proper assessment of the potential candidates are also analysed by the BNRC. The BNRC then shortlists the candidates.

The BNRC conducts engagement sessions with the short-listed candidates prior to submitting its recommendation to the Board. The BNRC shall recommend to the Board the proposed appointment of the successful candidate. The Company Secretary, with the authorisation by the Board, will arrange the necessary with regards to the appointment accordingly.

During the Financial Year under review, several movements in the Top Management took place. The Board/BNRC deliberated on the succession planning for critical positions in TNB vigorously, intended to discover and manage the development of TNB's future leaders.

The Board at its meeting on 30 September 2024 had approved the appointment of Badrulhisyam bin Fauzi as the Chief Financial Officer to lead Group Finance Division with effect from 1 January 2025. The appointment was made due to the cessation of office of Nazmi bin Othman upon the expiry of his employment contract on 31 December 2024.

Datuk Ir. Azmi bin Md Yusof was appointed as Chief Global Business Solutions Officer with effect from 15 November 2024, replacing Datuk Ahmad Hushairi bin Ibrahim due to his retirement.

These appointments were made after intensive assessments and deliberations process as well as taking into account their qualifications, working experience, expertise, professionalism, knowledge of the Company and industry as well as assessment by an independent expert.

The Board is satisfied that the BNRC has efficiently discharged its duties pertaining to the nomination, remuneration and succession management functions as set out in its TOR.

The BNRC annually evaluates the performance of the President/CEO and Top Management, whose remunerations are directly linked to their respective KPIs. The President/CEO's remuneration package is reviewed by the BNRC to reflect the contributions made towards the Group's achievements for the year. The BNRC's views and recommendations on this are submitted to the Board for its deliberation/approval.

Based on the evaluation for the Financial Year under review, the Board collectively concurred that the succession planning for President/CEO and Top Management as well as for the Company's future leaders has been appropriately developed.

# SUPPLY OF INFORMATION AND ACCESS TO ADVICE

Prior to each Board meeting, a Pre-Board session is convened to facilitate collaboration between Management and the Chairman, allowing for the exchange of insights regarding the upcoming agenda. This collaborative effort shapes the agenda for the Board meetings, ensuring alignment with strategic objectives. Utilising advanced meeting software, agenda and Board papers are securely circulated to Board Members within five (5) working days prior to each meeting, enabling thorough review and preparation.

In addition to the Board papers, Management presentations are provided to enhance Directors' understanding of the subject matter, allowing for informed discussions. Directors are encouraged to seek further clarification or information during the meeting, promoting an environment conducive to thoughtful decision-making. The core activities of the Board and its Committees are documented and planned on a forward agenda, with any matters arising tracked and addressed in subsequent sessions.

The Company Secretary plays a pivotal role in advising the Board on governance matters, facilitating smooth flow of information and ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and corporate governance practices. Effective collaboration with stakeholders across all Group functions, coupled with ongoing training and discussions on key issues, is paramount to maintaining governance standards.

Both the Board and Individual Directors have the autonomy to seek independent or professional advice at the Company's expense to facilitate well-informed decision-making. This may involve the attendance of external advisers at meetings or obtaining necessary information from within the Group's workforce.

# BOARD OF DIRECTORS' FIT AND PROPER POLICY

The Board of Directors' Fit and Proper Policy outlines the criteria for the appointment and re-appointment of Directors within TNB and its subsidiaries. This policy is structured around three (3) key pillars: character and integrity, experience and competence, and time and commitment. It is accessible on the Company's official website at www.tnb.com.my.

# RE-ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

Clause 64(1) of the Company's Constitution provides, among others, that one-third (1/3) of the Directors at the time being of whom have been longest in office shall retire by rotation at the AGM of the Company and shall be eligible for re-election.

Clause 63(2) of the Company's Constitution provides, among others, that the Directors shall have the power at any time and from time to time to appoint any other person to be a Director of the Company either to fill a casual vacancy or as an addition to the existing Directors. Any Director so appointed shall hold office only until the next following AGM of the Company and shall then be eligible for re-election.

Rohaya binti Mohammad Yusof, Juniwati Rahmat Hussin, Gopala Krishnan K.Sundaram and Dato' Merina binti Abu Tahir are retiring by rotation in accordance with Clause 64(1) of the Company's Constitution and being eligible, have offered themselves for re-election.

The Board recognises the Directors' performance are used as basis in recommending their re-election to the shareholders. This, in turn, is determined through their annual evaluation and independence assessment, which were assessed by the BNRC before any recommendation was made to the Board for deliberation and approval.

Based on the annual independence assessment undertaken by Juniwati Rahmat Hussin, Gopala Krishnan K.Sundaram and Dato' Merina binti Abu Tahir who are retiring at the coming AGM, the Board/BNRC are satisfied that these Independent Directors had complied with the independence criteria as prescribed by the MMLR and continued to bring independent and objective judgement to the Board.

They have exercised their duty of care and diligence as Directors in the best interest of the Company, its shareholders and stakeholders. Through the Board Effectiveness Assessment the

retiring Directors (save for Alan Hamzah Sendut, who shall be evaluated in FY2025) on average, have received excellent rating, and have met the performance criteria required of an effective and high-performance Board.

Alan Hamzah Sendut, who was appointed to the Board during the Financial Year shall retire at the forthcoming AGM in accordance with Clause 63(2) of the Company's Constitution and being eligible, has offered himself for re-election.

Rohaya binti Mohammad Yusof is a Non-Independent Non-Executive Director who represents EPF on the Board.

Based on the declaration of COI by the retiring Directors, the respective Directors shall take necessary mitigation plan/ measures to address the COI including any interest in any competing business within the Company or its subsidiaries that could affect the execution of their roles as Company Directors. They will recuse themselves from participating in any discussions pertaining to the matters involving the interest of respective Companies with TNB Group and will abstain from deliberation and voting on such matters at the Board and Board Committee meetings.

Having considered their fit and proper assessment including declaration of conflict of interest, due diligence for the newly appointed Director, professionalism, vast experience, material relationship, competency, commitment and individuals' contributions in performing their respective duties, the Board and the BNRC are satisfied that all Directors who are standing for re-election at the  $35^{\text{th}}$  AGM have met the Board's expectation by continuously discharging their duties diligently as Company Directors.

With that, upon the BNRC's assessment, the Board resolved to support and recommend the re-election of each Director who is retiring at the upcoming  $35^{\text{th}}$  AGM.

# DIRECTORS' DEVELOPMENT AND INDUCTIONS

In supporting the Board's responsibilities, a comprehensive training and development programme is extended to all Directors, with the assessment of training needs embedded within the Board evaluation process. This programme encompasses regular presentations from Management and informal meetings, fostering a profound understanding of the business, sector dynamics, and areas acknowledged for their technical complexity. The training initiatives aim to not only deepen comprehension but also endow Non-Executive Directors with insights into how TNB's practices compared with those of its peers.

A robust induction programme is crafted for all new Directors, featuring tailored components such as meetings with Top Management, site visits and briefings on key operational matters, Board procedures and governance practices.

During the Financial Year under review, the Directors' Induction Programmes were held for Alan Hamzah Sendut on 11 December 2024, 12 December 2024, 7 January 2025, 3 February 2025 and 5 February 2025 where the Top Management from respective Divisions, presented their businesses overview and functions/roles in TNB. He also attended the Board Site Visit to PE Elmina No. 16, City of Elmina, Shah Alam, Selangor on 17 December 2024.

Megat Jalaluddin bin Megat Hassan, Ramzi bin Mansor, Dato' Zulkifli bin Ibrahim and Alan Hamzah Sendut, had attended the Mandatory Accreditation Programme Part I (in relation to a Director's roles, duties and liabilities) (MAP Part I) and the Mandatory Accreditation Programme Part II in relation to sustainability and the related roles of a Director (MAP Part II).

Facilitating the Board in organising both internal and external programmes and seminars relevant to Directors' needs is a responsibility shouldered by the Company Secretary's Office. This includes the annual in-house Board Development Programme (BDP), an integral component of TNB's ongoing Board Continuing Development Programme.

As requested by the Board for clearer understanding of the COI Policy and Guideline, the Integrity Department, assisted by the Company Secretary's Office, organised a seminar "Managing Conflict of Interest" by Asia School of Business on 4 October 2024, at Leo Moggie Convention Centre, TNB Platinum, Bangsar, Kuala Lumpur, which was tailored to the revised TNB COI Policy and Guideline.

# BOARD EVALUATION

Acknowledging the transformative potential of an objective and well-managed board evaluation process, the Board acknowledges its pivotal role in enhancing Board effectiveness, thereby delivering substantial benefits to the Company. This commitment is manifested through annual performance evaluations, thoughtfully designed induction programs for new Board members and a continuous stream of Board development activities.

TNB fully supports Practice 6.1 of MCCG whereby for Large Companies, the Board engages independent experts at least every three (3) years to facilitate objective and candid Board evaluations. The previous Board Effectiveness Assessment by an independent expert, was carried out in Financial Year 2023.

# 2024 BOARD EFFECTIVENESS ASSESSMENT (BEA) RESULTS

The 2024 BEA was conducted internally and facilitated by the Company Secretary through set of online questionnaires. Save for Alan Hamzah Sendut and the Alternate Director, 11 Directors participated in the 2024 BEA. Alan Hamzah Sendut was appointed to the Board on 2 December 2024 and shall be evaluated at the next BEA for the Financial Year ending 31 December 2025.

The questionnaires for the 2024 BEA comprised of Assessments of the Board, Chairman of the Board, each Board Committee and its Chairman, Individual Directors and Board Committee members' Self and Peer (SPA).

The effectiveness of the Board is assessed in the areas of Corporate Strategy and Direction Setting, Board Governance & Oversight, Board Committees' Relevance, Board Dynamics and Composition and Board Management & Operations as well as the Board's key priorities.

The effectiveness of each Board Committee is assessed in terms of its structure and processes, accountabilities and responsibilities and its dynamic/composition as well as the effectiveness of the Chairman of respective Board Committees. The SPA for the Board Committee members is similar to the Directors' SPA, which is intended to assess their contribution, performance, calibre and personality in relation to the skills, experience and other qualities they bring to the Board/Board Committees.

The feedback from the Top Management was also being sought through this exercise via online questionnaires. The Management's feedback on the Board's role and the extent of collaboration between the Board and Management in certain focus areas and in the review/decision-making process are useful for the Board's consideration in enhancing its overall effectiveness.

Based on the 2024 BEA results, the Board demonstrated solid performance with excellent rating on average across various effectiveness indicators, including Corporate Strategy & Direction

Setting, Board Governance & Oversight, Board Composition, Boardroom Conduct & Dynamics, and Board Management & Operations.

While the SPA of the Directors further underscored the Directors' performance on average with excellent rating, indicating that each Director was generally effective in dispensing his/her responsibilities.

The respective Board Committees and its Chairmen overall scored excellent ratings on average indicating that the Members and Chairman of standing Committees had effectively discharged their roles in accordance with the respective TORs and added significant value to the Board & Company as well as possessed the required qualification, skill sets, competencies, knowledge and expertise to contribute to the overall effectiveness of the respective Committees.

Building upon the insights from the 2023 BEA, the Board continued to showcase strong and effective leadership in 2024. It was highlighted by both the Board and Management that there was a clear distinction of roles and responsibilities of the Chairman and President/CEO, signalling robust and effective leadership in guiding the Company's direction. Tan Sri Abdul Razak bin Abdul Majid was rated as good and effective Chairman demonstrating decisiveness and an action-oriented approach while creating an open and consultative environment within the Board.

The Board was seen to be effective in ensuring the integrity of the Company is aligned with regulatory requirements, internal standards and best practices. The Board was committed to its fiduciary duties and assumed the core responsibilities of reviewing and monitoring the Group's strategic plan, overseeing and evaluating the conduct of the Group's business and establishing sound risk management and internal control frameworks for the Group.

Following the 2024 BEA outcome, action plans were identified by the BNRC and approved by the Board on 24 March 2025, whereby among others the Board shall continuously put its focus in term of oversight of the Company's strategic direction, to consider the enhancement of the respective Board Committees composition/scope and further improvement to be made regarding the Board management & operation. These will be addressed accordingly by the Board and Top Management to close the gap and to ensure the Board remains effective in discharging its roles and duties for the Company.

A summarised report of BEA was tabled to the Board by the BNRC Chairman to discuss areas of improvement and action plan

# EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND TOP MANAGEMENT REMUNERATION

The compensation structure for the Executive Director is designed to correlate rewards with both corporate and individual performance. It encompasses salary, allowances, bonuses and customary benefits aligned with industry standards. A significant part of the Executive Director's compensation is variable and contingent upon annual performance against individual KPIs embedded in a scorecard aligned with Board-approved corporate objectives. Notably, the Executive Director shall abstain from participating in discussions and voting on his remuneration or rewards during Board meetings.

The BNRC conducts an annual review of the Executive Director's performance, submitting informed views and recommendations to the Board regarding potential adjustments in remuneration or rewards, reflecting the Executive Director's contributions to the Group's achievements for the year.

Top Management's remuneration package comprises three (3) distinct components: the base salary, fixed allowances and benefits, the Short Term Incentive (STI) and the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). The base salary is set competitively,

considering the scope of work, experience and anticipated performance. Fixed allowances are separate from the base salary and are granted for specific cash benefits.

The STI, contingent on annual performance, is disbursed as bonuses, contingent upon the Company's profitability and the performance of Top Management. Evaluation criteria include quantitative targets and qualitative alignment with the Company's values. The LTIP is designed to retain and reward Top Management, aligning their interests with the long-term success of the Company.

TNB places a strong emphasis on a performance-driven culture, where the remuneration policy aims to compensate competitively for sustained performance, aligning with shareholders' interests. The Company, in adherence to Practice 8.2 of the MCCG, opts not to disclose specific components of Top Management's remuneration, citing potential disadvantages to the Company's business interests. Further details can be found in the Corporate Governance Report.

# NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION

Non-Executive Directors receive remuneration in the form of fixed monthly fees, meeting allowances and benefits-in-kind, covering items among others, such as the reimbursement of medical, utilities bills, business peripherals, travelling and telecommunication.

The Non-Executive Directors' Remuneration is structured to reflect the complexity, responsibility and accountability of the Board's role in complying with increasing regulatory demands, to be competitive and to retain the required talent as well as recognising their skills that are highly sought after and to ensure it reflects the time and effort dedicated by the Chair and Directors as part of their roles on the Board and Board Committees. The remuneration structure takes into account the intricacies of the Company's operations and the industry at large. Notably, the remuneration and benefits for Non-Executive Directors was last reviewed in 2013.

The Board in 2023 had engaged an independent expert to conduct a holistic and independent review of the Non-Executive Directors' Remuneration with the view to determine its market competitiveness and alignment with the latest regulations/ corporate governance guidelines in Malaysia.

Based on the findings, the Board recommended the Director's fees of Non-Executive Chairman to be revised from RM30,000.00 per month to RM32,000.00 per month considering the importance of his roles and responsibilities that he carries for the operation and leadership of the Board in ensuring its effectiveness and in strengthening TNB's relationship with the stakeholders/shareholders. With that, the Non-Executive Chairman's fee competitiveness will sit between P25 and P50 mark of the peer group in the market.

In determining the estimated total amount of benefits payable, the Board had considered various factors including the meeting allowances based on the respective committees in term of responsibilities/accountabilities, the frequency of scheduled and special meetings for the Board, Board Committees and boards of subsidiaries along with the number of Non-Executive Directors involved.

Details of each Director's remuneration for the Financial Year ended 31 December 2024 is disclosed in the Corporate Governance Report 2024, which is available on the Company's website at www.tnb.com.my

The Directors' Remuneration Policy is shaped by the following underlying principles:

The Board Audit Committee (BAC) was established to assist the Board to carry out their oversight and fiduciary duties and responsibilities.

BAC's objectives, authorities and functions are governed by the Terms of Reference (ToR). The ToR was last reviewed in November 2023 and approved by TNB's Board in December 2023. The ToR is accessible on the Company's official website at www.tnb.com.my.

# MEMBERSHIP AND MEETINGS

The BAC is chaired by Dato' Merina binti Abu Tahir effective 1 February 2022. The BAC remains committed in adhering to the practice outlined in the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance 2021 (MCCG), whereby the BAC Chairman is not Chairman of the Board.

As of 31 December 2024, the BAC comprises four (4) Independent Directors, all of whom are Non-Executive Directors.

The governance practices are further enhanced by the BAC's compliance with Paragraph 15.09 (l) (c) of the MMLR, which mandates that at least one (l) member of the Audit Committee must be a member of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants (MIA). Two (2) members of the BAC, Dato' Merina binti Abu Tahir and Ong Ai Lin, are members of MIA.

# EFFECTIVE AUDIT AND RISK MANAGEMENT

# STATEMENT OF INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION

The Group Internal Audit Department (GIA) of TNB is mandated to strengthen TNB's ability to create, protect, and sustain value by providing Board Audit Committee (BAC) and Management with independent, risk-based, and objective assurance, advice, insight, and foresight.

To uphold its independence and objectivity, GIA follows a dual reporting structure – reporting functionally to the BAC for oversight and assurance, and administratively to President/CEO for operational support; thereby ensuring the necessary authority to perform its duties effectively.

Since 1 April 2021, the Chief Internal Auditor (CIA), Lizah Abd Wahab has been spearheading CIA, bringing over 20 years of invaluable experience in internal auditing and leveraging her extensive knowledge to lead the department with expertise and vision. She holds a Bachelor of Accounting and Finance degree from Manchester Metropolitan University, United Kingdom and a Master of Business Administration from Universiti Tenaga Nasional, Malaysia and Graduate Certificate in Management from the University of Melbourne, Australia. Additionally, she is a Certified Internal Auditor and obtained a Certification of Risk Management Assurance from Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA).

# GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK

GIA adopts the following governance documents and frameworks in managing the internal audit activities:

- The Internal Audit Charter (the Charter) defines GIA's mandate, organisational position, reporting relationships, scope of work and types of services. To ensure alignment with the current business environment and its intended purpose, GIA reviews the Charter annually and presents it to the BAC for approval.  
- The internal audit activities are foundationally guided by the Global Internal Audit Standards (GIAS) issued by the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) which comprises five (5) domains, 15 principles and 52 standards. Adopting a more stringent approach, GIA is required by the BAC to undergo an external assessment every three (3) years – in contrast to the GIAS requirement of every five (5) years; with results of the review to be reported to the BAC upon completion.  
- The widely used Internal Control Framework of Committee of Sponsoring Organisation of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT) are adopted by GIA in assessing and reporting the adequacy and effectiveness of the design and implementation of the organisation's governance, risk management and control processes.

# SCOPE AND COVERAGE

GIA undertakes a risk-based approach when developing its Annual Audit Plan, taking into accounts factors such as TNB's risk profile, business strategy, sustainability objectives, regulatory obligations as well as insights from the BAC and Senior Management.

The areas of review are classified into five (5) key audit hotspots, reflecting the current trend, change in risk environment and the dynamic roles of internal auditors. Some of the areas of review encompassed:

Audit findings were presented to the BAC for deliberation and where relevant, BAC requested Management to rectify the weaknesses based on recommendations provided by GIA. GIA oversees the execution of corrective actions and reports the status to BAC and Management on a quarterly basis.

To enhance the value delivered to the Company and ensure the efficiency of audit activities, the key performance indicators set for the internal auditors include value creation through cost savings/ recoveries and business process improvements implemented, completion of audit plan and audit turnaround time.

Additionally, to strengthen GIA's presence and reinforce its advisory roles, GIA regularly conducts knowledge sharing and facilitation sessions on matters related to governance, risk management and controls, as well as advise on implementation of new processes, policies and procedures at various levels within the Company. This also includes facilitation through data analytics on key areas identified to support organisational goals.

# EFFECTIVE AUDIT AND RISK MANAGEMENT

# ETHICS, INTEGRITY & TRUST

![](images/0f838624c7e9410800b1934f615b644e38530cfb9a5b1546ea868b07b70185f9.jpg)

# IN 2017, TNB WAS ONE OF THE FIRST LISTED CORPORATION TO EMBARK ON THE ISO 37001:2016 ANTI-BRIBERY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (ABMS) CERTIFICATION.

Towards achieving the certification, TNB launched the TNB Corporate Integrity Management System (TCIMS) to drive an integrity-based culture and a high level of compliance with local and international anti-bribery standards. On 15 November 2018, TNB was awarded with the ABMS Certification from SIRIM and to further reinforce this culture, launched the TCIMS Handbook. TNB has a well thought out set of Shared Values made publicly available and communicated to the workforce. First among the TNB Shared Values is Integrity. The three (3) behaviours of Integrity are:

# 3 BEHAVIOURS OF INTEGRITY

We uphold the highest ethical standards and do what is right, all the time  
2 We are fair, honest and transparent in everything we do  
We always seek to achieve mutual benefit for the Country, Company and customers

The TCIMS covers four (4) main policies, namely the Anti-Bribery Policy; the Gifts, Hospitality and Related Benefits Policy; the Conflicts of Interest Policy; and the Whistleblowing Policy.

In 2022, TNB reviewed these four (4) main policies to align with current policies, circulars and practices. In 2024, the COI Policy was further reviewed to enhance the existing COI disclosures as required by the MMLR.

During the Financial Year under review, surveillance audits by SIRIM were conducted involving the Procurement & Supply Chain Division (P&SC) and four (4) wholly-owned subsidiaries of TNB, namely Malaysia Transformer Manufacturing Sdn. Bhd. (MTM), TNB Integrated Learning Solution Sdn. Bhd. (ILSAS), TNB

Fuel Services Sdn. Bhd. (TNBF) and TNB Repair and Maintenance Sdn. Bhd. (TNB REMACO). There were two (2) recertification audits by SIRIM conducted for Retail Division and a subsidiary of TNB, Tenaga Cable Industries Sdn. Bhd. (TCI). All the entities successfully retained the ISO 37001 Anti-Bribery Management System certification by SIRIM.

In 2022, TNB signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) and signed the Corruption Free Pledge. This pledge emphasises the pledges and promises made by the leadership of TNB and its staff voluntarily in their capacity as an organisation to ensure that each of us will be more responsible in carrying out our duties and curbing corruption.

TNB has conducted the Integrity Health Survey (IHI) in 2024, where 28,451 staff participated in the survey. Based on the survey, TNB received a  $91.89\%$  score as opposed to  $87.16\%$  in 2023. TNB has also established a systematic approach through the Annual Training and Communication Plan (TCP) capitalising on 3Es (Education, Engagement and Enforcement) for the areas of improvement identified through the Integrity Health Survey conducted in 2023.

In 2024, all activities under the TCP were successfully completed including Seminar for Boards and Top Management. A series of trainings and awareness sessions were conducted by Integrity Department to better equip the Company in line with the implementation of Section 17A of the MACC Act 2009. These included the following:

Related programs to Divisions/Departments and Subsidiaries  
- Three (3) sessions of Fraud and Bribery Risk Management workshop  
- All staff including Subsidiaries staff were required to complete Anti-Corruption training  
- All staff are required to sign the integrity pledge, declare any conflicts of interest annually and specifically as and when a conflict arises  
- Certified Integrity Officer (CelO) Program was co-organised by TNB and MACC  
Joint integrity programs with MACC  
Published 14 Integrity bulletins and 12 e-posters

# LIMITS OF AUTHORITY

The Limits of Authority lays down guiding principles governing decision-making throughout the Group, emphasising the escalation and reporting procedures to the Board. Delegating authority is a key aspect, with the Board entrusting the President/CEO and other Executives to oversee the Company's day-to-day activities. This delegation includes the responsibility to recommend and approve both monetary and non-monetary limits of authority for operational and management decisions before execution. The Limits of Authority strikes a balance between effective oversight and empowering the Management with appropriate accountability.

# CODE OF ETHICS FOR DIRECTORS

The Board of Directors adheres to the Code of Ethics for Company Directors established by the Companies Commission of Malaysia. Each Non-Executive Director is equipped with the Non-Executive Directors' Handbook, serving as a reference for their professional responsibilities and the terms and conditions of their service. This handbook undergoes regular updates to reflect changes in applicable rules, regulations, and policies governing Directors' conduct.

# CODE OF BUSINESS ETHICS (COBE)

The code ensures adherence to laws and regulations, promotes sound employment practices, upholds confidentiality and privacy, and addresses matters such as conflicts of interest, business courtesies and the proper use of TNB's assets. It also outlines how TNB engages with its shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers and the communities in which it operates, emphasizing general principles of business integrity. All employees are expected to conduct business in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, contributing to the enhancement and protection of TNB's reputation.

# ORGANISATIONAL ANTI-CORRUPTION PLAN

Serving as a foundational document, this plan outlines a comprehensive strategy aimed at mitigating governance challenges and fortifying integrity within the Company. By proactively addressing potential corruption risks and promoting ethical conduct among employees, the plan seeks to uphold TNB's commitment to governance excellence.

# SUSTAINABLE PROCEDURE CODE OF CONDUCT

During the Financial Year under review, TNB Procurement Code of Conduct was enhanced with sustainability element and rebranded to Sustainable Procurement Code of Conduct (SPCC). The SPCC was approved by GEMC on 13 March 2024 and was enforced on mandatory basis in April 2024.

In line with TNB's ESG strategy, the Procurement & Supply Chain Division had developed the SPCC with the sub-element of ESG while maintaining the key elements of anti-corruption and abuse of power.

TNB is committed to ensuring responsible management of its procurement process. The SPCC outlines the practices and professional conduct expected of all Suppliers/Contractors of TNB towards upholding TNB's values of integrity, transparency and accountability. The SPCC applies to all employees, Seconded Employees, Directors and suppliers/contractors including their employees and directors.

The SPCC is guided by the core values of TNB namely integrity, collaborative, professionalism, customer centric, forward thinking and mindfulness and focuses on three (3) key elements of ethical conduct: (1) Zero tolerance on corruption; (2) No conflict of interest; and (3) Honest and accurate representation of capabilities.

Additionally, the Procurement & Supply Chain Policy and Procedures provide comprehensive guidance for executing procurement within TNB. This policy framework enables TNB to achieve optimal value, adopt leading business practices, prioritise business objectives, add value to customers and maintain high standards of corporate governance. TNB's COBE, SPCC and Organisational Anti-Corruption Plan are accessible on the respective sections of the Company's website at www.tnb.com.my.

# EFFECTIVE AUDIT AND RISK MANAGEMENT

# CONFLICTS OF INTEREST (COI)

In upholding principles of ethical and independent decision-making and the enhancement to the existing COI disclosures as required by the MMLR, the Directors and Top Management are required to disclose on the nature and extent of any COI or potential COI, including interest in any competing business that the person has with TNB and its subsidiaries.

Directors or Top Management with such interests are required to declare them immediately and at the respective meetings to be abstained from participating in the deliberations and voting, in ensuring impartial decision-making. Mitigation actions shall be taken upon any declaration of COI by the Directors or Top Management, with the concurrence of the President/CEO/Chairman/Senior Independent Non-Executive Director. In addition, TNB Directors, Top Management and its Boards of Subsidiaries are required to make COI declaration annually and on ad hoc basis.

To ensure the enhancement of the existing COI disclosures as prescribed by the MMLR, the TNB COI Policy was revised and approved by the TNB Board on 16 December 2024. Additionally, the Guideline on COI Management for the Board of Directors and Key Senior Management of TNB was developed and approved by the Board Integrity Committee on 20 November 2024.

The revised TNB COI Policy and Guideline were reviewed jointly by the Integrity Department, Company Secretary's Office, Group Legal Department, Group Internal Audit Department and the external legal advisor in ensuring the alignment with the MMLR on Guidance on COI.

In addition, the declaration of COI (if any) is included in the agenda of the respective TNB Board and Board Committees' meetings prior to the tabling of the papers.

The COI Policy is a live document which will be reviewed periodically, and as and when the need arises.

As practiced by the Procurement & Supply Chain Division in collaboration with the Integrity Department, each Director shall sign an Integrity Pledge during every BTC/Board meeting. This commitment entails a declaration of any interests related to procurement or matters on the meeting agenda, underscoring the Company's dedication to preventing corruption, mitigating conflicts of interest and safeguarding the confidentiality of information.

# WHISTLEBLOWING PROCEDURE

The Whistleblowing Procedure underscores TNB's commitment to fostering an open working environment, where employees, contractors and members of the public can confidentially report instances of unethical, unlawful or undesirable conduct without fear of intimidation or reprisal. An independent investigation team examines all reported concerns and where applicable, offers feedback on the outcome of the investigation.

The objectives of the Whistleblowing Procedure are threefold:

- To identify and address unacceptable conduct.  
- To cultivate a supportive working environment that empowers employees and contractors to raise legitimate concerns with both personal and organisational implications.  
- To safeguard individuals who, in good faith, report unacceptable conduct from any adverse consequences.

Reporting channels are made easily accessible through the Online Whistleblowing Information System (WBIS) at http://wbis.tnb.com.my. Alternatively, reports can be submitted via email to the designated officers using the Whistleblowing Complaint Form, available in both Malay and English.

# ANTI-BRIBERY POLICY

TNB is resolute in articulating its position on bribery and related matters, establishing essential pillars within its framework to fortify the Company against any manifestation of bribery. All forms of bribery related to TNB's activities are unequivocally prohibited. Upholding integrity is a collective responsibility that extends across all levels of personnel.

Guided by a stringent Gifts, Hospitality and Related Benefits Policy, TNB emphasises integrity through the regular signing of Integrity Pledges and the declaration of conflicts of interest by personnel. While certain exceptions may exist, TNB ensures that these policies are consistently adhered to. Prudent management of business associates acting on behalf of the Company further enhances TNB's commitment to ethical conduct.

The reporting of misconduct by personnel or third parties is not only encouraged but expected, with robust protection in place for those acting in good faith as whistleblowers. Enforcing its position on ethical standards, TNB entrusts the Integrity Department with the responsibility of upholding and reinforcing these principles.

The TCIMS undergoes periodic assessments and updates to ensure its continued effectiveness in upholding the Company's commitment to ethical business practices. This proactive approach reflects TNB's dedication to maintaining the highest standards of integrity in its operations.

# INTEGRITY IN CORPORATE REPORTING AND MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP WITH STAKEHOLDERS

# RELATIONSHIP WITH EXTERNAL AUDITORS

The Board maintains an open and professional association with External Auditors and the BAC is entrusted with recommending their appointment or removal, approving their remuneration, and establishing the terms of engagement for Board approval.

Responsibilities of the Board and BAC include reviewing, assessing, and monitoring the performance, suitability and independence of External Auditors. A comprehensive policy outlines guidelines and procedures for the assessment and monitoring processes, covering aspects such as Selection and Appointment, Independence, Conflict of Interest, Non-Audit Services, Rotation of Audit Partner, Annual Reporting, Annual Assessment and Audit Fees.

The appointed Audit Partner undergoes rotation at least every seven (7) Financial Years, with a mandated five (5) year gap before returning as the Audit Partner for the engagement. While External Auditors may be engaged for non-audit services, their objectivity, judgment and independence must not be impaired. Written assurance of meeting independence requirements is obligatory for each non-audit service undertaken for the TNB Group.

Three (3) fundamental principles govern the prohibition of non-audit services: External Auditors cannot function in a management role, audit their own work or serve in an advocacy role for TNB Group. Compliance with the By-Laws of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants (MIA) concerning non-audit services is mandatory, with the application of safeguards if necessary.

TNB External Auditors Policy stipulates a three (3)-year cooling-off period for a former partner of TNB's External Auditors before being appointed as a BAC member in accordance with Practice 9.2 of the MCCG. Additionally, in alignment with Guidance 9.3 of the MCCG, the annual assessment of External Auditors incorporates information from the Annual Transparency Report of the audit firm.

The BAC, in evaluating the External Auditors' independence, had also considered the non-audit fees provided for services during the Financial Year. These fees should not compromise or impair the independence or objectivity of the External Auditors.

The amount of Audit and Non-Audit Fees paid or payable to PwC or its affiliates by the Company and TNB Group for the Financial Year ended 31 December 2024 is as follows:-

<table><tr><td></td><td>Group (RM million)</td><td>Company (RM million)</td></tr><tr><td>Statutory Audit</td><td>5.1</td><td>1.6</td></tr><tr><td>Audit Related Services</td><td>1.9</td><td>1.3</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>7.0</td><td>2.9</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Non-Audit Services:</td></tr><tr><td>- Tax Related Services</td><td>1.0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>- Other Non-Audit Services</td><td>0.1</td><td>0.1</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>1.1</td><td>0.1</td></tr></table>

The Non-Audit Fees did not exceed  $50\%$  of the Audit Fees for the Financial Year under review, in line with TNB's External Auditors Policy.

All services were procured competitively in accordance with TNB's Procurement & Supply Chain Policy and Procedures and External Auditors Policy. Non-audit services can be offered by the External Auditors of the Group if there are clear efficiencies and value added benefits to the Group.

Based on the External Auditors Assessment Results for the Financial Year 2024, overall, the Company was Completely Satisfied/Satisfied with the score of  $96.9\%$ , reflecting a consistently high level of satisfaction similar to the previous financial year. With the services provided by PwC in terms of quality, sufficiency of resources, communication and interaction and independence, objectivity and professional skepticism. All comments made were forwarded to PwC in order to further improve their services.

With that, the Board/BAC are satisfied with the quality of service, sufficiency of resources, communication and interaction and independence, objectivity and professional skepticism demonstrated by PwC in carrying out its duties as External Auditors.

Being satisfied with the External Auditors' performance, the Board recommends their re-appointment for shareholders' approval at the AGM.

# INSIDER TRADING

TNB Directors and Top Management must not deal in the securities of the Company or of other listed issuers as long as he/she is in possession of price-sensitive information relating to such listed securities. This is in line with the MMLR and pertinent provisions of the Capital Markets & Services Act 2007. Notices delineating closed periods for trading in TNB's securities are disseminated on a quarterly basis, well in advance of each closed period. The Company Secretary shall make appropriate announcement upon receiving any notices of dealing in securities in line with Paragraphs 14.08 and 14.09 of the MMLR respectively.

# RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT IN RESPECT OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR UNDER REVIEW

The Board holds full responsibility for ensuring the preparation of Audited Financial Statements aligns with the Companies Act 2016 and the approved accounting standards set forth by the Malaysian Accounting Standards Board. This commitment is aimed at presenting an accurate portrayal of the Group's state of affairs, profit or loss and cash flow at the close of the accounting period. In the preparation of these financial statements, the Directors confirm compliance with applicable approved accounting standards in Malaysia, exercising reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates. Furthermore, the Audited Financial Statements are prepared on a going concern basis, as the Board, upon thorough inquiry, reasonably expects the Group to possess adequate resources for its operational continuity in the foreseeable future.

# Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control

The Board of Directors (the Board) is pleased to present its Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control (SORMIC) for the financial year ended 31 December 2024. This statement, collaboratively developed and jointly endorsed by the Board, Sustainability & Risk Committee (BSRC) and the Board Audit Committee (BAC), adheres to the stipulations set forth in paragraph 15.26(b) of the Main Market Listing Requirements of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad (Bursa). Additionally, it is guided by the Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control - Guidelines for Directors of Listed Issuers issued by Bursa.

The SORMIC delineates the nature and breadth of the risk management and internal control systems in TNB Group, including subsidiaries, throughout the reviewed fiscal year. It provides an overview of the framework, policy, process and measures adopted to mitigate risks and uphold operational integrity within TNB Group. The scope of this disclosure excludes associated companies and joint ventures.

The Board persistently upholds its overarching responsibility and remains dedicated to the establishment and continual upkeep of robust, efficient, and effective risk management and internal control systems. This commitment serves to safeguard shareholders' investments and the assets held by the Group. These systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate risks and therefore provide reasonable rather than absolute assurance against material losses, misstatements, or other significantly adverse consequences.

# RISK MANAGEMENT

# Risk Management Framework

Risk management in TNB is governed by the TNB Risk Management Framework, which adopts the principles and guidelines set out in ISO 31000:2018, 'Risk Management - Guidelines'. This framework, approved by TNB Board, provides a structured and consistent approach for risk management implementation across the Group. The purpose of risk management is to create and protect value and this is exemplified through each element in the TNB Risk Management Framework (Fig. 1).

The implementation of this framework is guided by our risk governance documents. The criteria and frequency of revision as well as approval levels for the risk governance documents are outlined in the TNB Risk Management Framework document. This ensures that the risk governance documents are robust and practical.

Following our annual review in 2024, the Group Risk Management Working Committee (GRMWC) has approved to streamline to four (4) risk governance documents, which are TNB Risk Management Framework, TNB Risk Management Policy, TNB Risk Assessment Process and Key Risk Indicator Guide (Fig. 2).

# Risk Management Policy

The TNB Risk Management Policy is a statement of the overall intention and direction of the Group on risk management. It describes the commitment of the Group to assess risks in alignment to business objectives, integrating risk management in all decision-making processes, anticipating potential risks while identifying opportunities in response to changes in the internal and external environments and ensuring that risk information is communicated through a clear and robust monitoring and reporting structure.

The policy emphasises on the role of all TNB employees, who are responsible and accountable to manage risks by taking all reasonable care to minimise loss, maximise opportunity and ensure TNB's reputation is upheld.

# Leadership and Commitment

The TNB Risk Management Structure (Fig. 3) depicts the leadership and commitment of Board and Management in the escalation and cascading of risk information across all levels.

The BSRC reaffirms the Board's commitment to ensure that the Group has in place a robust risk management framework and that such framework has been effectively implemented to enhance the Group's ability to achieve its strategic objectives.

The BSRC is supported by the Management, primarily through the Group Executive Management Committee chaired by the President/Chief Executive Officer. It is complemented by the cross-functional Group Risk Management Working Committee (GRMWC) and Subsidiaries Risk Management Working Committee (SRMWC).

The Risk Management Department (RMD) helmed by the Chief Risk Officer facilitates the implementation of the TNB Risk Management Framework.

In the year under review, the BSRC remained committed to diligent oversight, convening twelve (12) meetings to address various risks and opportunities related to strategic initiatives and operational dynamics. The BSRC also discussed the risk profiles of TNB business entities with in-depth deliberations on Key Risk Indicators (KRIs). Business entities provided assurances to the BSRC on robust risk management practices and internal controls, supporting the Board's decision-making to capitalise on opportunities and manage potential risks.

Furthermore, the BSRC endorsed the TNB Sustainability Framework and Policy that was approved by the Board, and the TNB Sustainability Statement and Sustainability Report FY2023 for public disclosure. Additionally, the BSRC approved revisions to the TNB Risk Dashboard for FY2024 reporting and improvements to the TNB Investment Risk Methodology, reflecting its risk appetite.

# STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL

# Risk Assessment Process

TNB business entities are guided by the TNB Risk Assessment Process that provides a structured approach to identify, analyse, evaluate and treat risks. TNB business entities apply the process in a systematic, iterative and collaborative manner, drawing on the knowledge and views of stakeholders to develop and review their respective risk profiles.

The TNB Strategic Risks were assessed according to the process and anchored on the Group strategy as well as in consideration of internal and external factors. Below are the twelve (12) TNB Strategic Risks approved by the BSRC:

<table><tr><td>Category</td><td>No.</td><td>TNB Strategic Risk</td></tr><tr><td>External</td><td>1.</td><td>Catastrophic disruptions from external factors
TNB faces the potential threat of unpredictable external events, which possess the capacity to significantly disrupt our business operations, profitability, and/or reputation. These events encompass various external factors, including but not limited to pandemics, cybersecurity attacks, economic collapses, and geopolitical risks. Although these occurrences have a low probability of transpiring, their unpredictability renders them capable of inflicting catastrophic impacts on our business operations.</td></tr><tr><td>Sustainability</td><td>2.</td><td>Inability to keep pace with Environment, Social &amp; Governance (ESG) developments and transitions globally
Corporations worldwide face increased risks in transitioning to a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy. It is vital that we align to global ESG commitments and frameworks given TNB's role as Malaysia's primary power utility. Failure to do so will impede our business growth in addition to eroding market confidence in TNB to be a utility that is able to provide sustainable energy solutions. This will adversely impact investors' confidence, stakeholder's trust and company reputation.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">Regulatory</td><td>3.</td><td>Unfavourable energy transition &amp; climate change policies &amp; regulations
Energy Transition regulatory risks pose significant challenges for power utilities. The shift towards renewable energy sources and decarbonisation initiatives may require costly infrastructure upgrades and technology investments. Evolving regulations can impact revenue streams and profitability, especially if incentives or subsidies change. Stricter emissions standards might necessitate the retirement of existing assets or impose penalties for non-compliance. Additionally, uncertainties in policy direction may hinder long-term planning and investments. Failure to address these risks adequately can undermine TNB's competitiveness and financial stability.</td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td>Unfavourable Electricity Supply Industry (ESI) regulatory implementation and outcome
Globally, the electricity supply industry is highly regulated. Government regulations and policies control various aspects, including approving generation capacity and mix, setting limits for investment and operation costs of electricity networks, and determining electricity prices. Uncertainty surrounding future regulations may hinder long-term planning and investment decisions whilst non-compliance with regulations can result in penalties and reputational damage. Inability to shape and manage the outcome of these regulation and policies governing the Malaysian ESI would be key impediment impacting TNB ability to deliver its business aspiration.</td></tr><tr><td>5.</td><td>Regulatory Uncertainty
Due to the nature of our business, we are susceptible to the decisions by regulatory stakeholders at the federal, state and international levels. Business operations may be delayed or encumbered due to measures and decisions in relation to investment and divestment, use of natural resources and right-of-way.</td></tr><tr><td>Market</td><td>6.</td><td>Unable to be competitive in non-regulated business (international &amp; domestic)
Growing TNB's non-regulated business is a key strategy of TNB's future growth plans. Inability to be competitive would result in difficulty to attract new customers and potential partners leading to stagnant or decline in market share and potential revenue. Inadequate competitiveness may result in lower operational efficiencies and higher costs that may hamper our ability to access capital while reducing the overall returns.</td></tr><tr><td>Customer</td><td>7.</td><td>Inability to remain as the electricity provider of choice by customers
TNB supplies electricity that is reliable and safe to retain the trust and confidence of customers. At the same time, we need to continue growing TNB's brand and reputation. Failure to do so may cause customer dissatisfaction and impact our sales, financial performance and reputation.</td></tr><tr><td>Finance</td><td>8.</td><td>Ineffective capital allocation to maximise value creation
Management makes decisions on how to source and allocate funds effectively to maximise potential return. Failure to do so would have dire implications to TNB, including missed opportunities, reduced financial profits and market confidence.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Capabilities</td><td>9.</td><td>Gaps in workforce capabilities to deliver the Reimagining TNB strategy and sustainability aspiration
It is critical for TNB to focus on developing and deploying new institutional capabilities to the right areas. We also need to enhance workforce diversity in terms of skill sets and exposures that are in line with our aspiration to diversify internationally. Failure to close the capabilities gap would impact TNB's ability to achieve its RT strategy.</td></tr><tr><td>10.</td><td>Failure to ingrain TNB culture in employees' behaviour in supporting Reimagining TNB strategy and sustainability aspiration
Culture moulds the direction, beliefs and shared values that shapes employee (at all levels including the Board)'s perceptions, behaviours and understanding. Failure to ingrain our core values in the organisation and processes may result in lower productivity, fraud and bribery or silo mentality.</td></tr><tr><td>Physical Asset Risk</td><td>11.</td><td>Failure to mitigate physical risks caused by climate change
Physical climate change risks pose significant challenges to TNB in the form of extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and changing precipitation patterns that can damage infrastructure, disrupt operations and impact power generation, transmission and distribution. Failure to manage these risks can result in prolonged outages, increased operation and repair costs, regulatory penalties, reputational damage and impede long-term business sustainability.</td></tr><tr><td>Supply Chain</td><td>12.</td><td>Disruptions to supply chain
TNB's ability to ensure the security of supply depends on undisrupted procurement and distribution of resources needed to operate all its infrastructure. Delays or disruption resulting from supplier failure, transportation issues and geopolitical interventions may lead to delays in project delivery, prolonged electricity supply outages and increased costs.</td></tr></table>

# Review, Monitor and Report

The BSRC approved the TNB 3-Year Cycle Risk Governance Plan for implementation from FY2022 to FY2024. The plan outlines three (3) risk governance activities, which are risk review, risk maturity assessment and desktop risk assessment. According to plan, RMD in collaboration with TNB business entities, conducted fifteen (15) risk reviews, five (5) risk maturity assessments and eight (8) desktop risk assessments in the year under review.

TNB business entities assess respective risks and register into the TNB Risk Information System (TRIS), a centralised online real-time tool and database, for monitoring and reporting. Risks are also reviewed annually by the business entities with participation and eventual approval from the risk owners.

Half-year risk reports are submitted by business entities to RMD for consolidation. Group-wide consolidated half-year risk reports, which include reports of emerging risks, are deliberated and endorsed by the GRMWC for onward internal dissemination.

# Key Risk Indicators

Business entities have diligently identified relevant Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) that are developed in consideration of the risk appetite of the BSRC and Management. The status of KRIs is reported quarterly to the BSRC, GRMWC and SRMWC with mitigating measures extensively deliberated to address risk exposures from escalating beyond tolerable levels.

The BSRC monitors eleven (11) KRIs in the TNB Risk Dashboard with best- and worst-case projected outlooks and supported by resiliency indicators. Operational-level KRIs are deliberated by the GRMWC and SRMWC that are platforms for inter-business collaboration to mitigate risks from a group-wide perspective.

Annually, these KRIs undergo review to ensure relevance and adequacy, aligning with company strategy and considering changes in internal and external environments.

# Communication & Integration

TNB business entities consistently engage in communication with both internal and external stakeholders, providing current and comprehensive risk information. Timely feedback is gathered and integrated to foster continual enhancements. The risk managers from various business entities across the Group forms the TNB Risk Manager Circle, which enables greater collaboration and exchange of knowledge on risk management best practices, emerging risks and opportunities. This integration ensures that risk management continues to be a shared responsibility, enhancing the overall resilience and adaptability of the Group.

To stay ahead of potential challenges, we closely monitor the evolving external landscape and bimonthly emerging risk insights are communicated to business entities, fostering a culture of proactive risk management. In the year under review, the RMD analysed and communicated risk insights to Management for anticipated events in the global arena, and domestically, risk exposures related to the anticipated Malaysian northeast monsoon and heatwave, and power system reliability during four (4) Pilihan Raya Kecil in Peninsular Malaysia.

RMD continues to collaborate with the TNB Integrated Learning Solution Sdn. Bhd., the centre for energy learning, advisory, services and consultancy, in building risk management competencies at fundamental and intermediate levels. In the year under review, a total of 96 TNB employees completed the fundamentals training module and 36 employees completed the intermediate training module.

The TNB Risk Management E-Learning Module has been incorporated as part of the learning journey of all TNB executives, whereby each TNB executive shall complete the online module every two (2) years. The purpose of the e-learning module is to enhance the risk management capabilities among TNB executives to make informed decisions.

# STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL

# Culture

The risk culture delineated within the TNB Risk Management Framework harmonises seamlessly with the six (6) TNB core values and corresponding behaviours. The application of these core values and behaviours serves as a beacon, offering clear guidance and communicates the expected behaviour of employees. This alignment fortifies a cohesive understanding, establishing a framework for fostering and perpetuating a resilient and enduring risk culture essential for TNB's sustainable growth and resilience.

# INTERNAL CONTROL

# Group Policies and Procedures

The Board and Management have approved group-wide policies and procedures, embedding ethics and internal control principles and mechanisms within business operations. Regular review processes ensure the ongoing relevance and effectiveness of these policies and procedures.

Among others, the Group policies and procedures in place are:

TNB Code of Ethics  
TNB Ethics & Integrity Policy  
TNB Whistleblowing Policy  
TNB Risk Management Policy  
TNB Sustainability Policy  
TNB Confidentiality Policy  
TNB Asset Management Policy

# Financial and Operational Control Framework

The TNB Group Financial Policies and Procedures stand as an imperative point of reference guiding the Group's financial and operational conduct. The Group has acted in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and the International Financial Reporting Standards and Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards. Regular evaluations comparing actual performance against established budgets, targets, and historical benchmarks for key functions and strategic initiatives are carried out. Necessary mitigating measures and follow-up actions are promptly implemented.

The BAC reviews the Group's quarterly financial performance together with Management and these are subsequently reported to the Board. The quarterly reviews enable the BAC to deliberate and assess the Group's financial results and operational performance.

TNB continues to proactively engage with relevant stakeholders for smooth implementation of the Incentive-Based Regulations (IBR) framework. The performance of the regulated business is meticulously monitored through the IBR performance indicators and dashboards. These are reported regularly to relevant decision-making committees to ensure effective implementation of the IBR framework as well as to the Energy Commission in compliance with the IBR guidelines.

The procedures for critical functions and key activities are documented, communicated to employees and periodically reviewed. Relevant business entities have been consistently maintaining its certification in ISO 9001, ISO 14001, ISO 27001, ISO 37001, ISO 45001 and ISO 55001. Internal audits are conducted to ensure compliance with relevant standards and procedures.

# Strategic Planning and Performance Management Cycle

A holistic strategic planning process is integral in providing focus and alignment between aspiration, strategies, performance management and the desired strategic outcomes. The Strategic Planning and Performance Management (SPPM) cycle approved by the Board depicts a 5-part cycle that integrates the capital and budget allocation process with the performance management cycle. It includes the identification of strategy driven Key Performance Indicators (KPI) based on long-term business plans and annual operating plans, which are thereafter cascaded to all levels of employees. The strategy driven KPI methodology is derived from the Balanced Scorecard concept that focuses on performance measures from four perspectives, which are financial, customer, internal process and learning and growth.

# Human Resource Management and Development

The TNB Ways of Working (TWoW) that promotes flexible working arrangements seamlessly aligns with amendments in the Employment (Amendment) Act 2022, particularly in embracing and enacting flexible working arrangements. This way of working aims to inspire and add value to employees, create an agile workforce and foster a culture of wholehearted dedication, underpinned by the fundamental principles of trust, empowerment, and mindfulness.

Job descriptions and responsibilities of approved positions are clearly defined and communicated through the internal online platform, People Matters Better Brighter. Workforce requirement planning is carried out and led by the Group People Division, mirroring the budget planning cycle with the aim of optimising staffing levels and increasing productivity. Employee training needs are regularly assessed and various programmes are in place to address competency gaps.

Moreover, effective succession management improves organisational ability to maintain continuity of operations with minimal disruption and benefits both the employees by preparing them to be strong talents and the organisation by facilitating smooth transitions. The TNB Succession Management Framework ensures that the succession management strategy is agile and in line with current and projected business objectives by defining critical positions, nominating and evaluating talents, identifying development needs, and reviewing and adapting to business needs.

# Healthcare & Wellness Management

TNB is committed towards elevating the standard of healthcare for its employees, retirees, and dependents. 1,329 panel hospitals and clinics are available nationwide for widespread accessibility to essential medical treatment and healthcare. Medication Delivery Services continues to facilitate seamless procurement and delivery of long-term or chronic medications right to the doorstep.

The TNB Total Wellness Programme aimed at educating and influencing employees towards a healthy lifestyle and work life balance continues to be implemented through the "Vibrant Living - Healthier. Together" initiative. This initiative focuses on six (6) scopes, which are healthy diet, no smoking/vaping, active lifestyle, weight management, basic health screening and mental wellbeing. Weekly "Wellness Wednesday" health talks and awareness sessions conducted online are open to all employees and retirees with the aim of increasing awareness on common health issues and encouraging healthier habits.

# TNB Digital Strategy

TNB has undertaken significant digitalisation endeavours to embrace digital transformation as a key enabler of the RT strategy. These initiatives encompass data analytics, robotic process automation, and development of a visionary Network of the Future. These efforts empower TNB to achieve its strategic goals, positioning the organisation as an industry leader in the energy sector by delivering sustainable value to stakeholders while fostering innovation and resilience.

In the year under review, an in-house Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform called weKNOW has been introduced as a catalyst for Generative AI innovations tailored to TNB's needs. This platform ensures that sensitive information is maintained within TNB's controlled environment, safeguarding it against data leaks and reinforcing our commitment to data security.

# Management Information Systems

Leveraging on information and communication technology is vital in promoting effective and efficient business operations as well as timely and accurate communication with internal and external stakeholders. Examples of key information systems utilised by the Group for that purpose are:

Enterprise Resource Management System (ERMS)  
Enterprise Human Resources Management System (EHRMS)  
Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System (SCADA)  
TNB Outage Management Systems (TOMS)  
Billing Customer Relationship Management (BCRM)  
$\odot$  Employee Self Service (ESS)

Super User Privilege Management and Governance, Risk and Compliance systems are implemented to control and govern access to core systems and servers. This ensures that access to critical information systems and confidential information is adequately monitored and controlled. Annual disaster recovery tests are carried out at our data centres and ICT security assessments are regularly carried out on systems at the business entities. In addition, various enhancements are implemented to strengthen cyber security for Information Technology and Operational Technology systems. In the event of system failure, various mitigations are in place to minimise disruption to operations.

# Personal Data Protection

TNB is committed to safeguarding data subjects' personal data in accordance with the Personal Data Protection Act 2010 (PDPA). TNB was the lead and active contributor to the development of The Personal Data Protection Code of Practice for The Utilities Sector (Electricity) Version 2.0 (Code of Practice), which serves as a guideline for the processing and handling of data subjects' personal data.

Given the importance of data privacy, our Legal Services Department is committed to consistently educate and communicate with employees through various platforms such as in-person training sessions, e-learning, documented circulars and guidance notes, as well as conducting personal data protection observation audits to enhance awareness and instil a PDPA compliance culture. These initiatives are designed to enhance employees' understanding and compliance with data protection laws, ensuring TNB maintains the highest standards of data protection and privacy.

# TNB Corporate Integrity Management System

TNB is certified with the ISO 37001:2016 Anti-Bribery Management Systems since 2018 and has put in place a TNB Corporate Integrity Management System (TCIMS) designed to help prevent, detect and respond to bribery as well as comply with anti-bribery laws and voluntary commitments applicable to our activities. The TCIMS is designed to foster an integrity-based culture across the Group by mitigating the risk of misconduct and corruption. The TCIMS allows both employees and external parties to report misconduct or illegal activities via the TNB Whistle Blowing Information System, whereby all concerns are independently investigated with actions taken accordingly.

Additionally, a comprehensive training plan on ethical behaviour is outlined in our annual Training & Communication Plan (TCP). The TCP is an important component in our strategy to foster a strong integrity culture. This comprehensive plan includes ethical standards training for the Board, employees, contractors, and vendors. The training elements in TCP among others include integrity seminars tailored for the Board and Management, Integrity e-learning for all employees, contractors and vendors, and in-person awareness sessions with employees. The TCP also covers communication strategies such as publications of integrity bulletins and e-posters communicated through internal channels. These efforts align with the requirements outlined in the TRUST elements under Section 17A of the MACC Act 2009.

# Tenaga Safety Culture

The Tenaga Safety Culture programme aims to inculcate safety as part of the everyday working culture, transforming it from a mere compliance activity. It is based on four core behaviours, which are 'Assess', 'Comply', 'Intervene' and 'Actively Caring'. Various initiatives have been implemented such as the TNB Life Saving Rules (LSR) that are intended to preserve the lives of employees and contractors, and mitigate the risk of serious injuries within the work environment. The LSR implementation includes consequence management as part of our internal control.

The Stop Work Intervention guideline empowers employees and contractors to assume responsibility for their safety and the safety of their peers. Any individual is authorised to activate a stop work intervention upon encountering unsafe conditions or observing unsafe acts within the workplace.

# STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL

We prioritise employee safety and well-being by mandating biennial safety and health training through the Tenaga Safety Passport module. We empower employees for greater self-regulation by providing relevant training, equipping them with the necessary skills to implement robust health and safety practices in their respective workplaces. This ensures that safety remains paramount in all our operations and is deeply ingrained in our corporate culture.

# Customer Experience

TNB is committed to delivering exceptional customer experiences through our “Click, Call, Come Over, Go Over” strategy. Our strategy covers a wide range of touch points that enable quality solutions and services as well as continuous interaction options to enhance customer experience. Additionally, our innovative solutions, such as the myTNB app, empower customers with real-time energy insights and energy efficiency tips to support their energy journey. The myTNB app also allows customers to make express payment of electricity bills without needing to log in. Simultaneously, our Kedai Tenaga outlets offer personalised, in-person assistance for those who prefer face-to-face interactions.

By leveraging social media platforms, we actively engage with customers, sharing energy-saving tips, promoting renewable energy initiatives, and addressing customer concerns. Our subsidiary, GSPARX Sdn. Bhd., empowers consumers to become prosumers through zero-upfront-cost solar photovoltaics installations, enabling them to generate clean energy and reduce their carbon footprint.

# Business Continuity Management

The TNB Business Continuity Management (BCM) Framework was developed in alignment with ISO 22301:2019 'Security and Resilience - Business Continuity Management Systems'. The framework provides a structured approach in managing business continuity in the Group that enables prompt, coordinated and effective response to a crisis and maintain continuity of essential activities as well as protecting human life, assets, reputation and the environment. The framework is the focal point of reference for TNB business entities to formulate and implement business continuity strategies tailored to respective business objectives and critical functions.

The robustness of the TNB Corporate Crisis Command Structure is tested through planned drills and is activated to manage potential or declared crises in accordance with the TNB Corporate BCM document. The Corporate Crisis Management Team (CMT), led by TNB President/Chief Executive Officer, also places importance on the management of pre-crisis incidents that may impact company reputation and customer experience. The Corporate CMT peruses daily dashboard reports of public, customer and regulatory sentiments related to our business operations and where necessary, additional mitigations are taken to prevent incidents from escalating to crisis.

To further strengthen prompt and coordinated response during crises that affect the nation, strategic engagements and drills are conducted with relevant government agencies such as the National Disaster Management Agency. Collaborations with the Malaysian Meteorological Department and Malaysia Space Agency are sought for early notification of climate related risk exposures and data analysis to enhance business continuity plans.

# GROUP INTERNAL AUDIT

The Group Internal Audit (GIA) is set up by the Board to provide an independent and objective assurance on the effectiveness of governance, risk management processes and internal control systems in TNB Group. GIA maintains its independence by reporting functionally to the BAC and reports administratively to the President/Chief Executive Officer. GIA functions and activities are guided by its Internal Audit Charter approved by the BAC and is aligned with the Global Internal Audit Standards (GIAS) issued by the Institute of Internal Auditors.

GIA plans and undertakes regular reviews and assessments taking into consideration strategic and operational risks faced by the organisation as approved by the BAC. The reviews also include recommendations for improvement opportunities in areas with internal control lapses. The progress and closure of corrective actions arising from reviews are monitored through a dashboard and reported to management and BAC on a quarterly basis. Follow-up audits were also performed to ensure corrective actions were completed accordingly by management.

GIA reports the state of internal controls based on completed audits on a quarterly basis to the BAC.

# CONCLUSION

The Board has obtained assurances from the President/Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer that the Group's risk management and internal control system is operating adequately and effectively, in all material aspects. Where areas of improvement have been identified, rectification steps have been taken for enhancement.

The Board is of the view that the risk management and internal control system in place for the year under review and up to the date of approval of this statement for inclusion into the annual report, is adequate and effective to safeguard shareholders' investment, the interests of customers, regulators and employees, and the Group's assets.

# Notes to The Financial Statements

# 31 December 2024

# 1 GENERAL INFORMATION

The Group and the Company are primarily involved in the business of the generation, transmission, distribution and sales of electricity and those tabulated in Note 48 to these financial statements, which also includes the details of the subsidiaries of the Group.

There have been no significant changes in these activities of the Group and of the Company during the financial year.

The Group and the Company follow the Incentive Based Regulation ('IBR') framework for the regulated business in Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah and the Federal Territory of Labuan.

The Company is a public limited liability company, incorporated and domiciled in Malaysia and is listed on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad.

The address of the registered office of the Company is Pejabat Setiausa Syarikat, Tenaga Nasional Berhad ('TNB'), Tingkat 16, Tower A, TNB Platinum, No. 3, Jalan Bukit Pantai, Bangsar, 59100 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

The financial statements of the Group and the Company have been approved for issuance in accordance with a resolution of Board of Directors on 20 March 2025.

# 2 BASIS OF PREPARATION

The financial statements of the Group and of the Company have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards ('MFRS'), International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS') and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The Directors continue to consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except as disclosed in Note 3 and respective notes in the financial statements.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with MFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. It also requires the Directors to exercise their judgement in the process of applying the Group's and the Company's accounting policies. Although these estimates and judgements are based on the Directors' best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may differ. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in Note 4.

(a) Amendments to published standards that are effective and applicable to the Group and the Company.

Effective for financial year beginning on 1 January 2024:

<table><tr><td>Amendments to MFRS 107 Cash Flow Statements and MFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures</td><td>Supplier Finance Arrangements</td></tr><tr><td>Amendments to MFRS 16 Leases</td><td>Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback</td></tr><tr><td>Amendments to MFRS 101 Presentation of Financial Statements</td><td>Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current and Non-current Liabilities with Covenants</td></tr></table>

The amendments to the published standards listed above did not have any significant impact on the amounts recognised in prior periods and are not expected to significantly affect the current or future periods.

Effective for financial year beginning on 1 January 2026:

Amendments to MFRS 9 and MFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures

Effective for financial year beginning on 1 January 2027:

MFRS 18

Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements

MFRS 18 will replace MFRS 101 Presentation of Financial Statements, introducing new requirements that will help to achieve comparability of the financial performance of similar entities and provide more relevant information and transparency to users. Even though MFRS 18 will not impact the recognition or measurement of items in the financial statements, its effects on presentation and disclosure are expected to be pervasive, particularly those related to the statement of financial performance and providing management-defined performance measures within the financial statements.

The Group and the Company are currently assessing the detailed implications of applying the new standard on the group's consolidated financial statements. From the high-level preliminary assessment performed, the following potential impacts have been identified:

(i) Although the adoption of MFRS 18 will have no impact on the Group and the Company's net profit, the Group and the Company expect that grouping items of income and expenses in the statement of profit or loss into the new categories will impact how operating profit is calculated and reported.  
(ii) The line items presented on the primary financial statements might change as a result of the application of the concept of 'useful structured summary' and the enhanced principles on aggregation and disaggregation. In addition, since goodwill will be required to be separately presented in the statement of financial position, the Group will disaggregate goodwill and other intangible assets and present them separately in the statement of financial position.  
(iii) The Group and the Company does not expect there to be a significant change in the information that is currently disclosed in the notes because the requirement to disclose material information remains unchanged; however, the way in which the information is grouped might change as a result of the aggregation/disaggregation principles. In addition, there will be significant new disclosures required for:

management-defined performance measures;  
· a break-down of the nature of expenses for line items presented by function in the operating category of the statement of profit or loss - this break-down is only required for certain nature expenses; and  
for the first annual period of application of MFRS 18, a reconciliation for each line item in the statement of profit or loss between the restated amounts presented by applying MFRS 18 and the amounts previously presented applying MFRS 101.

MFRS 18 will be applied retrospectively.

# 2 BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED)

(b) New standard and amendments to the published standards that are applicable to the Group and the Company but not yet effective. (continued)

Effective date deferred by Malaysian Accounting Standards Board:

Amendments to MFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and MFRS 128 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures

Sale or Contribution of Assets between and Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture

Other than MFRS 18, the amendments to published standards are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group and the Company.

There are no other standards, amendments and improvements to published standards and interpretations to existing standards that are not effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group and the Company.

# 3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The material accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below and within the respective notes to the financial statements line items.

(a) Subsidiaries and basis of consolidation

(i) Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when:

exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity;  
· has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the relevant activities of the entity, and  
- the existence and effect of potential voting rights are considered only when such rights are substantive when assessing control.

In the Company's separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses. On disposal of such investments, the difference between net disposal proceeds and their carrying amounts are included in the statement of profit or loss.

(ii) Basis of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. The characteristics of those financial statements are:

the financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting date as the Company.  
- subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which the Group obtains control and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.  
- intragroup balances, transactions and unrealised gains or losses are eliminated in full.  
uniform accounting policies are adopted in the consolidated financial statements for like transactions and events in similar circumstances.

The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement and fair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are, with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair value at the acquisition date.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

31 December 2024

# 3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

(a) Subsidiaries and basis of consolidation (continued)

(ii) Basis of consolidation (continued)

The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any NCI in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Group's share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If this is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the gain is recognised in the statement of profit or loss. Refer to Note 10 for accounting policy on goodwill.

NCI is the equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the Group measures any NCI in the acquiree either at fair value or at the NCI's proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. At the end of the reporting period, NCI consists of amount calculated on the date of combinations and its share of changes in the subsidiary's equity since the date of combination.

All earnings and losses of the subsidiary are attributed to the parent and the NCI, even if the attribution of losses to the NCI results in a debit balance in the shareholders' equity.

(iii) Changes in ownership interest

When the Group ceases to consolidate because of loss of control, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value with the change in carrying amount recognised in the statement of profit or loss. This fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in OCI in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in OCI are reclassified to statement of profit or loss. Gains or losses on the disposal of subsidiaries include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the subsidiaries sold.

(b) Transactions with NCI

Transactions with NCI that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as transactions with equity owners of the Group. A change in ownership interest results in an adjustment between the carrying amounts of the controlling and NCI to reflect their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any differences between the amount of the adjustment to NCI and any consideration paid or received are recognised in equity attributable to owners of the Group.

(c) Impairment of non-financial assets

Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment losses whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit or loss for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less cost to sell and its value in use ('VIU'). For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets (cash-generating units).

Non-financial assets other than goodwill previously impaired are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. Any subsequent increase in recoverable amount is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.

All other material accounting policies are disclosed in their respective notes.

# 4 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS

Estimates and judgements are continuously evaluated by the Directors and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

The Group and the Company make estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, rarely equate to the related actual results. To enhance the information content of the estimates, certain key variables that are anticipated to have a material impact on the Group's and the Company's results and financial positions are tested for sensitivity to changes in the underlying parameters.

The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are outlined below:

(a) Impairment of intangible assets

The Group tests intangible assets which include goodwill for impairment annually in accordance with its accounting policy and whenever events or change in circumstances indicate that this is necessary within the financial period. This requires an estimation of the VIU of the cash generating unit ('CGU') to which the goodwill is allocated. Estimating the VIU requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the CGU to the Group and also to apply a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. The assumptions used, results and sensitivity of the impairment assessment of goodwill are disclosed in Note 10.

(b) Measurement of expected credit loss ('ECL') allowance for financial assets

The loss allowances for financial assets are based on assumptions about risk of default and expected loss rates. The Group and the Company use judgements in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the impairment calculation, based on the Group's and the Company's past history, existing market conditions as well as forward looking estimates at the end of each reporting period. Details of key assumptions and inputs used are disclosed in Note 45.

(c) Estimation and judgement made for recognition of income taxes

(i) Income tax

Income tax is estimated based on the rules governed under the Income Tax Act, 1967.

Differences in determining the capital allowances, deductibility of certain expenses and subsequent utilisation of reinvestment allowance may arise during the estimation of the provision for income tax between tax calculated at the statement of financial position date, and the final submission to the tax authority as a result of obtaining further detailed information that may become available subsequent to the statement of financial position date.

Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recognised, such differences will impact the income tax provisions and deferred tax balance in the period in which such determination is made.

The Group and the Company have recorded tax recoverable for which the Group and the Company believe that it is probable to be recovered. Where the final tax outcome of this matter is different from the amount that was initially recorded, such difference may cause a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the tax recoverable balance recorded in the period in which such determination is made.

# 4 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS (CONTINUED)

The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are outlined below: (continued)

(c) Estimation and judgement made for recognition of income taxes (continued)

(i) Income tax (continued)

Reinvestment allowance ('RIA') litigation

The Company and the Inland Revenue Board ('IRB') have entered into numerous litigation cases in respect of the Company's eligibility for RIA. The details of the cases are as disclosed in Note 42(a).

As at 31 December 2024, the Group and the Company recorded a tax recoverable of RM3,522.4 million from the IRB arising from:

Resubmission of tax computations for the Years of Assessment ('YAs') 2003 to 2006 and 2008 to 2012 pursuant to the explicit approval given by the IRB on 21 January 2013 on the eligibility of the Company in claiming the RIA amounted to RM1,765.2 million; and  
The payment which had been made to IRB in December 2020 in respect of YAs 2016 and 2017 amounted to RM1,757.2 million which is disputed by IRB as detailed in Note 42(a).

The Group and the Company have not recorded the potential additional tax liability arising from the tax impact if the RIA claimed is disallowed and the Company loses its litigation. The realisation of this tax recoverable and the potential tax liability are dependent on the outcome of judgement on the RIA claims by the Special Commissioners of Income Tax ('SCIT') and by the Kuala Lumpur High Court and Court of Appeal, including the subsequent notice of appeal filed by IRB before the Federal Court.

The Directors have performed an assessment on the tax recoverable of RM3,522.4 million and the potential tax liability of RM6,810.7 million based on legal view obtained from external legal counsel and the facts surrounding its RIA claims as disclosed in Note 42. The Directors have exercised judgement that there is sufficient evidence and case law to support the Company's appeal against the Notices and no provisions to be recognised with regards to the potential tax liability.

(ii) Deferred tax assets

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences or unused tax losses can be utilised. This involves estimating the sufficiency of future taxable profits of the particular entity in which the deferred tax asset has been recognised, as disclosed in Note 12.

(d) Post-employment employee benefits

The Group and the Company provide both Retirement Benefit Plan and Post-Retirement Medical Plan for certain employees. The present value of the employee benefits obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using certain assumptions. The key assumptions used in determining the net cost/(income) for the employee benefits include discount rate, medical claim inflation rate and salary increment rate. Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of employee benefits obligations, as disclosed in Note 24.

(i) Discount rate

The Group and the Company determine the appropriate discount rate at the end of each financial period. This is the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the pension obligations. In determining the appropriate discount rate, the Group and the Company consider the interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related employee benefits obligations.

# 4 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS (CONTINUED)

The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are outlined below: (continued)

(d) Post-employment employee benefits (continued)

(ii) Medical claim inflation rate

The medical claim inflation rate for general practitioner, hospitalisation, specialist and dialysis medical claims, as determined by the Group and the Company are based on the annualised increase in average claims over the past 7 years.

(iii) Salary increment rate

The salary increment rate for employees receiving the Retirement Benefit Plan as determined by the Group and the Company is based on the average salary increment rate for the past 15 years and considerations for price inflation, real salary increase, promotions and Collective Agreement ('CA') negotiation.

# 5 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ('PPE')

# Accounting Policy

PPE are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the construction or acquisition of the items and bringing them to the location and condition so as to render them operational in the manner intended by the Group and the Company and allocated according to its components.

Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the items can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised.

The cost of major overhaul/inspection is recognised in the asset's carrying amount as a replacement and the remaining carrying amount of the previous major overhaul/inspection is derecognised.

Major spare parts and standby equipment are recognised as assets when the Group and the Company expect to use for more than one period. Similarly, if the spare parts and servicing equipment can be used only in connection with an item of PPE, they are accounted for as PPE.

Gains or losses on disposal of PPE are determined by reference to their carrying amount and are recognised in statement of profit or loss.

Freehold land and capital work-in-progress are not depreciated. Other PPE are depreciated on the straight-line method to allocate the cost to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, summarised as follows:

Buildings and civil works 10 - 100 years

Plant and machinery 3 - 50 years

Lines and distribution mains 10 – 50 years

Distribution services 25 years

Meters 10 - 20 years

Public lighting 15 - 25 years

Furniture, fittings and office equipment 3 – 15 years

Motor vehicles 5 - 20 years

Residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate, on an annual basis.

At the end of the reporting period, the Group and the Company assess whether there is any indication of impairment. If such indications exist, an analysis is performed to assess whether the carrying amount of the asset is fully recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount (Note 3(c)).

# 6 RIGHT-OF-USE ('ROU') ASSETS

# Accounting Policy

A lease is a contract, or part of a contract, whereby the lessor conveys to the lessee the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Group and the Company assess whether:

- The contract involves the use of an identified asset - this may be specified explicitly or implicitly and should be physically distinct or represent substantially all of the capacity of a physically distinct asset. If the supplier ('lessor') has a substantive substitution right, then the asset is not identified;  
The customer (lessee) has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset throughout the period of use; and  
- The customer ('lessee') has the right to direct the use of the asset. In rare cases where the decision about how and for what purpose the asset is used is predetermined, the customer ('lessee') has the right to direct the use of the asset if either the customer ('lessee') has the right to operate the asset; or the customer designed the asset in a way that predetermines how and for what purpose it will be used.

# 6 ROU ASSETS (CONTINUED)

# Accounting Policy (continued)

The Group and the Company as lessees

The Group and the Company lease various buildings, plant and machinery, furniture and fittings, office equipment and motor vehicles. These leases have tenures between 1 and 25 years. Lease terms are generally negotiated on an individual basis. As for leasehold land, the remaining period of the respective leases ranges from 2 to 99 years.

(i) Initial recognition

The Group and the Company recognise a ROU asset and a lease liability for all leases conveying the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time.

The ROU assets recognised by the Group and the Company are initially recorded at cost, which comprise the following:

The amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability;  
Any lease payments made on or before the commencement date of the lease, less any lease incentives received;  
Any initial direct costs incurred by the Group and the Company; and  
An estimate of costs to be incurred by the Group and the Company in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, restoring the site on which it is located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the lessor.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date. The lease payments are discounted using the Group's incremental borrowing rate.

Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:

Fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable;  
Variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate;  
Amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;  
- The exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and  
- Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option.

(ii) Subsequent measurement

After initial recognition, the Group and the Company measure ROU assets at cost:

Less any accumulated depreciation;  
Less any accumulated impairment losses; and  
- Adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liabilities.

The Group and the Company measure the lease liability by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect lease payments made, and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessments or lease modifications. The interest on the lease liability is recognised as finance cost in the statement of profit or loss.

(iii) Extension and termination options

Extension and termination options are included in a number of property and equipment leases across the Group. In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated).

The assessment of reasonable certainty is reviewed if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs which affects this assessment and that is within the control of the lessee.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

31 December 2024

# 6 ROU ASSETS (CONTINUED)

# Accounting Policy (continued)

The Group and the Company as lessees (continued)

The Group and the Company have elected not to recognise ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets.

If an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, the Group and the Company apply MFRS 15 to allocate the consideration in the contract based on the stand-alone selling prices.

A ROU asset and its corresponding lease liability are recognised at the date the leased asset is available for used by the Group and the Company. Each lease payment is allocated between the principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to statement of profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The ROU asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.

At the end of the reporting period, the Group and the Company assess whether there is any indication of impairment. If such indication exist, an analysis is performed to assess whether the carrying amount of the asset is fully recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount (Note 3(c)).

The list of the Group subsidiaries is disclosed in Note 48. Capital and other commitments for the subsidiaries are disclosed in Note 41. Contingent liabilities for the subsidiaries are disclosed in Note 42.

(a) The Company wrote off its entire shareholding of 700,000 ordinary shares in Sepang Power Sdn. Bhd. ('SPSB') amounting to RM115.0 million as SPSB has been wound up. The write off was made against the accumulated impairment loss as the investment in SPSB was fully impaired in the previous financial years.  
(b) Movement in redeemable preference shares ('RPS'):

(i) On 2 February 2024, Power and Energy International (Mauritius) Ltd. ('PEIM') redeemed 300,000 unit of RPS from the Company for RM137.8 million (USD30.0 million).  
(ii) The Company subscribed to 928,258,791 new RPS issued by REVPH, by converting of amounts due from REVPH amounting to RM928.3 million on 1 March 2024 (RM914.0 million), 31 May 2024 (RM3.4 million) and 10 December 2024 (RM10.9 million).  
(iii) The Company subscribed to 31,731,127 new RPS issued by TNB Renewables Sdn. Bhd. ('TNBRE'), by cash amounting to RM31.7 million on 7 March 2024 (RM15.7 million) and 26 June 2024 (RM16.0 million).

(c) In the previous financial year, the Company had undertaken the impairment of its investment in PEIM. Based on the impairment assessment which estimates the cash flow available for distribution from PEIM divestment of its significant associate, GMR Energy Ltd, the recoverable amount of the Company's investment in PEIM exceeded its carrying amount, hence a reversal of impairment loss of RM137.7 million was recognised.

# 8 JOINT ARRANGEMENTS

# Accounting Policy

A joint arrangement is an arrangement over which there is contractually agreed sharing of control by the Group with one or more parties where decisions about the relevant activities relating to the joint arrangement require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. The classification of a joint arrangement as a joint operation or a joint venture depends upon the rights and obligations of the parties to the arrangement. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the joint venturers have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Joint operations are joint arrangements whereby the Company has the rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities. In respect of its interests in joint operations, the Company shall recognise in its financial statements the assets that it controls and the expenses and liabilities that it incurs and its share of the income that it earns from the sale of goods or services.

The Group's interest in joint ventures is accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting.

Equity accounting involves recognising in the consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of OCI and consolidated statement of changes in equity, the Group's share of profits less losses of the joint ventures based on the latest audited financial statements or management accounts of the joint ventures, made up to the financial year end of the Group. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the results and net assets of the joint ventures to ensure consistency of accounting policies with those of the Group. The Group's investments in joint ventures are recorded at cost inclusive of goodwill and adjusted thereafter for accumulated impairment losses and the post-acquisition change in the Group's share of net assets of the joint ventures.

Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in joint ventures. Unrealised losses are also eliminated on the same basis but only to the extent of the costs that can be recovered, and the balances that provide evidence of reduction in net realisable value or an impairment of the asset transferred are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

# 9 ASSOCIATES

# Accounting Policy

Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control or joint control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between  $20.0\%$  and  $50.0\%$  of the voting rights.

Investments in associates are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost. Equity accounting is discontinued when the Group ceases to have significant influence over the associates.

The Group's share of its associates' post-acquisition profits or losses are recognised in the statement of profit or loss, and its share of post-acquisition movements in OCI are recognised in OCI. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group's share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interests in the associate, including any long term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group's net investment in the associate, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. If the associate subsequently reports profits, the Group resumes recognising its share of those profits only after its share of the profits equals the share of losses not recognised. The Group's investments in associates include goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses (Note 3(c)).

Profits and losses resulting from upstream and downstream transactions between the Group and its associates are recognised in the Group's financial statements only for the unrelated investor's interests in the associates. The accounting policies of associates are adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

Dilution of gains and losses in associates are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.

If the ownership interest in an associate is reduced but significant influence is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognised in OCI is reclassified to statement of profit or loss where appropriate.

(a) (i) Impairment assessment for GB3 Sdn. Bhd. ('GB3') and Teknologi Tenaga Perlis Consortium Sdn. Bhd. ('TTPC')

2024

The Group had undertaken the impairment assessment of its investment in GB3 and TTPC. The assessments were triggered by the non-extension of power purchase agreement which raised uncertainty over the future profitability and ability of the associates to generate cash flows, leading to the expectation that the carrying amount of these investments would not be recoverable. Therefore, impairment loss of RM23.3 million and RM6.9 million was recognised for GB3 and TTPC respectively.

(ii) Impairment assessment for Blyth Offshore Demonstrator Limited ('BODL')

2024

The Group had reviewed the basis of impairment parameter updated based on 2024 data and concluded there was no impairment trigger. No further impairment assessment was performed.

2023

Due to adverse external market conditions, the Group had undertaken an impairment assessment of its investment in BODL in the current year. An impairment charge of RM31.2 million (GBP5.5 million) was recognised as its recoverable amount was lower than the carrying amount.

The recoverable amount of BODL was determined based on VIU calculations which applied a discounted free cash flow to equity model. The cash flow used are the most recent projections and sensitivity analysis was conducted to ensure the reliability of relevant variables.

# 10 INTANGIBLE ASSETS

# Accounting Policy

Goodwill

Goodwill arises from a business combination and represents the excess of the aggregate of fair value of consideration transferred, the amount of any NCI in the acquiree and the fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the acquisition date. If the fair value of consideration transferred is less than the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquiree in the case of a bargain purchase, the resulting gain is recognised in statement of profit or loss.

Goodwill is recognised in the statement of financial position as non-current asset at cost less accumulated impairment losses and tested for impairment annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the CGUs, or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. The carrying value of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of VIU and the fair value less costs of disposal. Any impairment is recognised immediately to the statement of profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity disposed.

Project development portfolio

The project development portfolio consists of contractual rights acquired relating to early stage solar, wind and Battery Energy Storage System ('BESS') projects in Australia.

The project development portfolio is stated at cost less any accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. They are considered to have a finite life and are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of expected future economic benefits of the asset with expected useful life of 5 years.

Amortisation of project development portfolio is recognised in profit or loss unless the economic benefits of the asset are directly attributable to the development of the assets. In such cases, the amortisation expense is capitalised as part of the cost of the development asset under property, plant and equipment.

The asset is reviewed annually for adjustments to the useful economic life and any indications of impairment. Impairment losses are recognised when the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its VIU.

Subsequent costs involved in renewing or maintaining the project development portfolio are charged to the statement of profit and loss as and when incurred.

# 10 INTANGIBLE ASSETS (CONTINUED)

Impairment assessment for goodwill

The carrying value of goodwill is allocated to the Group's CGUs. The recoverable amount of the CGU including goodwill, is determined based on the higher of its VIU and fair value. The VIU calculation applies a discounted cash flow model using cash flow projections based on forecast approved by management. The forecasts reflect management's expectations of revenue growth, operating costs and margins for the CGUs based on current assessment of market share, expectations of market and industry growth.

The discount rate applied to the cash flow forecast refers to the industry's pre-tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital ('WACC').

(a) Goodwill relating to operations in Malaysia

The discounted cash flow model used cash flow projections which covered a five-year period and cash flows beyond the projection years are extrapolated using an estimated terminal growth rate.

The following key assumptions have been applied in the VIU calculation:

<table><tr><td></td><td>2024
%</td><td>2023
%</td></tr><tr><td>Revenue growth rate</td><td>2.5</td><td>2.1</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-tax discount rate</td><td>8.9</td><td>8.8</td></tr><tr><td>Terminal growth rate</td><td>2.5</td><td>1.9</td></tr></table>

Based on the Group's assessment, no impairment losses were required as at 31 December 2024 as the recoverable amount exceeded the carrying amount.

The Group's review includes an impact assessment of changes in key assumptions used. Based on the sensitivity analysis performed, it was concluded that no reasonable change in the base case assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.

(b) Goodwill relating to operations in the United Kingdom

The Group has determined the recoverable amount of this CGU by assessing the VIU of the underlying assets. Based on the impairment assessment, the carrying value of the goodwill as at 31 December 2024 exceeded its recoverable amount by RM52.2 million (2023: RM123.6 million), mainly due to external market conditions affecting future cash flows.

The discounted cash flow model used cash flow projections which covered a 26-year period (2023: 27-year period).

The following key assumptions has been applied in the VIU calculation:

<table><tr><td></td><td>2024
%</td><td>2023
%</td></tr><tr><td>Revenue growth rate</td><td>(6.9)</td><td>(3.5)</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-tax discount rate</td><td>10.1</td><td>8.4</td></tr></table>

(c) Goodwill relating to operations in Australia

The goodwill is deemed to be attributable to Spark Renewable's future ability to develop and operate new renewable energy projects in Australia, as well as enhanced scale and operational diversity in its renewable projects portfolio.

The recoverable amount of the goodwill is determined based on its fair value less costs of disposal ('FVLCD') for its project development portfolio and operating asset.

The FVLCD of the project development portfolio is determined based on a market approach using observable risk-adjusted price per megawatt generation multiples for similar assets in the market, which is a Level 3 input.

The FVLCD of the operating asset is determined based on an income approach using a discounted cash flow projections, which covers a 36-year period.

The following key assumptions have been applied in the fair value income approach calculation:

<table><tr><td></td><td>2024
%</td></tr><tr><td>Revenue growth rate</td><td>2.9</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-tax discount rate</td><td>6.5</td></tr></table>

Based on the Group's assessment, no impairment losses were required as at 31 December 2024 as the recoverable amount exceeded the carrying amount.

The Group's review includes an impact assessment of changes in key assumptions used. Based on the sensitivity analysis performed, it was concluded that no reasonable change in the base case assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.

(d) Goodwill relating to operations in the Republic of Ireland

The Group has determined the recoverable amount of this CGU by assessing the VIU of the underlying assets.

The goodwill consists of potential upsides from extension of lease terms and grid connection approvals up to 15 years.

The discounted cash flow model used cash flow projections which covered a 38-year period.

The following key assumptions have been applied in the VIU calculation:

<table><tr><td></td><td>2024
%</td></tr><tr><td>Revenue growth rate</td><td>(2.0)</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-tax discount rate</td><td>5.4</td></tr></table>

Based on the Group's assessment, no impairment losses were required as at 31 December 2024 as the recoverable amount exceeded the carrying amount.

# 12 DEFERRED TAXATION

# Accounting Policy

Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements including those arising from business combinations. Deferred tax is not recognised on goodwill and those arising from initial recognition of an asset or liability which at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and unutilised tax credits can be utilised. Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising on investment in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Tax benefit from reinvestment allowance is recognised when the tax credit is utilised and no deferred tax asset is recognised when the tax credit is receivable.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.

The Group and the Company will recognise a deferred tax asset and a deferred tax liability for any temporary differences arising on initial recognition of a lease transaction. Where applicable, a deferred tax asset is recognised as the Group and the Company is able to benefit from the tax deductions in the future. Any differences between the deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability will be recognised in the profit and loss. Upon adopting the amendments, the Group and the Company do not expect material adjustments to the retained earnings as the initial recognition of the lease transactions gave rise to equal and offsetting temporary differences.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred taxes relate to the same tax authority. The following amounts, determined after appropriate offsetting, are shown in the statement of financial position:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">Group</td><td colspan="2">Company</td></tr><tr><td>2024

# 15 LEASES

# Accounting Policy

The Group and the Company as lessors

When the Group and the Company act as lessors, they determine at lease inception whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating lease. To classify each lease, the Group and the Company make an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease; otherwise, then it is an operating lease.

# Operating leases

Leases where the Group and the Company retain substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased assets are classified as operating leases. The Group and the Company recognise lease payments received under operating leases as operating income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

# Finance leases

If the Group and the Company transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased assets, leases are classified as finance leases. The Group and the Company derecognise the leased assets and recognise the net investment in the lease as a receivable. The difference between the gross receivable and the present value of the receivable is recognised as unearned finance income. Lease income is recognised over the term of the lease using the net investment method, which reflects a constant periodic rate of return.

The Group and the Company as lessees

The accounting policy on ROU assets and lease liabilities for lessees are disclosed in Note 6.

(a) Finance lease receivables

The Group's finance lease receivables arise from Cooling Energy Supply Agreement ('CESA') which amounts to RM6.0 million (2023: RM7.2 million). The effective interest rate implicit in the finance lease is approximately  $9.5\%$  (2023:  $9.5\%$ ). The carrying amount of the finance lease receivables approximately their fair values.

# 15 LEASES (CONTINUED)

# (b) Lease liabilities

The Group's and the Company's obligations under lease liabilities arise predominantly from the power purchase agreements with several Independent Power Producers ('IPPs').

# 15 LEASES (CONTINUED)

# (b) Lease liabilities (continued)

The weighted average effective interest rate applicable to the lease liabilities as at the financial year end for the Group and the Company are  $5.2\%$  (2023:  $5.2\%$ ) and  $5.7\%$  (2023:  $5.7\%$ ) per annum respectively. The carrying amounts of the lease liabilities approximate their fair values.

The Company recognised additional lease liability for the asset transfer of Platinum building to REV Platinum Sdn. Bhd. ('REVP') via a sale and leaseback transaction. The lease amounting to RM778.1 million was for a period of 15 years and commenced in March 2024.

During the financial year, there was an amendment to the planned outages of a power plant of the Group which had an impact on the Company's lease payment schedule. As a result, the carrying values of the associated ROU asset and lease liability were remeasured.

Reconciliation of lease liabilities during the financial year is as follows:

# 17 CONTRACT BALANCES

# Accounting Policy

(a) Contract cost assets - Costs to fulfil a contract

The Group recognises a contract cost that relates directly to a contract or to an anticipated contract as an asset when the cost generates or enhances resources of the Group which will be used in satisfying performance obligations in the future and it is expected to be recovered.

These contract costs are initially measured at cost and amortised on a systematic basis that is consistent with the pattern of revenue recognition to which the asset relates. An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit or loss when the carrying amount of the contract cost exceeds the expected revenue less expected cost that will be incurred. Where the impairment condition no longer exists or has improved, the impairment loss is reversed to the extent that the carrying amount of the contract cost does not exceed the amount that would have been recognised had there been no impairment loss recognised previously.

(b) Trade contract assets

A trade contract asset is recognised when the Group's and the Company's rights to consideration are conditional on something other than the passage of time. A contract asset is subject to impairment in accordance to MFRS 9 Financial Instruments (Note 45). Typically, the amount will be billed within 30 days of the supply of electricity for electricity customers and 60 to 180 days for satisfying the performance obligation for other revenue streams. An assessment of electricity supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading and the financial year end of the Group and of the Company (unread and unbilled) was made and it is recognised as trade contract assets. Payment is expected within 30 days from the billing date for all trade receivables.

# 17 CONTRACT BALANCES (CONTINUED)

# Accounting Policy (continued)

# (c) Trade contract liabilities

A trade contract liability represents the obligation of the Group and of the Company to transfer goods or services to a customer for which consideration has been received (or the amount is due) from the customers.

Trade contract liabilities primarily relate to contributions paid by electricity customers for the construction of electricity network assets. The customers' contributions are expected to be recognised as revenue over a period of 20 years, being the estimated average useful life of the electricity network assets used to connect the customers to the electricity supply.

Other trade contract liabilities within the Group are relating to students' fees. All other trade contract liabilities are expected to be recognised as revenue over the next 12 months.

The Group and the Company have recognised the following assets and liabilities related to contracts with customers:

# 17 CONTRACT BALANCES (CONTINUED)

The Group and the Company have recognised the following assets and liabilities related to contracts with customers: (continued)

(i) Significant changes in trade contract assets and liabilities

Trade contract assets have increased as the Group and the Company have provided more services ahead of the agreed payment schedules for fixed-price contracts. The Group and the Company also recognised a loss allowance for trade contract assets.

Trade contract liabilities have increased for the Group and the Company due to larger prepayments or contributions received from customers.

(ii) Revenue recognised in relation to trade contract liabilities

The following table shows how much of the revenue recognised in the current financial year relates to carried-forward trade contract liabilities and how much relates to performance obligations that were satisfied in a prior financial year:

Management expects  $3.6\%$  (2023: 5.0%) of the transaction price allocated to the unsatisfied contracts will be recognised as revenue during the next financial year. The remaining  $96.4\%$  (2023: 95.0%) will be recognised from financial years 2026 to 2043.

In respect of the supply of electricity, the Group and the Company applied the practical expedient to not disclose information related to the transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations, on the basis that revenue is recognised from the satisfaction of the performance obligations upon the consumption of electricity by the customers.

All contracts for period of one year or less are billed based on services provided. The transaction price allocated to these unsatisfied contracts is not disclosed.

# 21 RECEIVABLES, DEPOSITS AND PREPAYMENTS

# Accounting Policy

Trade and other receivables

Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. Other receivables generally arise from transactions outside the usual operating activities of the Group and the Company. If collection is expected in one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer), they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets.

Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value, which is the amount of consideration that is unconditional unless they contain significant financing components. The Group and the Company hold the trade receivables with the objective to collect the contractual cash flows and therefore measures them subsequently at amortised cost less accumulated impairment losses. The impairment is determined based on the ECL model and is further disclosed in Note 45.

Insurance contracts

Reinsurance contracts - initial recognition

The Group applies the premium allocation approach ('PAA') to all the reinsurance contracts it holds, as:

The coverage period of each contract in the group is one year or less, including insurance contract services arising from all premiums within the contract boundary; or  
- For contracts longer than one year, the Group has modelled possible future scenarios and reasonably expects that the measurement of the liability for remaining coverage for the Group containing those contracts under the PAA does not differ materially from the measurement that would be produced applying the general model. In assessing materiality, the Group has also considered qualitative factors such as the nature of the risk and types of its lines of business.

The premiums, if any, received at initial recognition;  
- Minus any insurance acquisition cash flows at that date, with the exception of contracts which are one year or less where this is expensed;  
- Plus or minus any amount arising from the derecognition at that date of the asset recognised for insurance acquisition cash flows; and  
Any other asset or liability previously recognised for cash flows related to the group of contracts that the Group pays or receives before the group of insurance contracts is recognised.

The Group calculates the loss-recovery component by multiplying the loss recognised on the underlying insurance contracts and the percentage of claims on the underlying insurance contracts the Group expects to recover from the group of reinsurance contracts held. The Group uses a systematic and rational method to determine the portion of losses recognised on the group to insurance contracts covered by the group of reinsurance contracts held where some contracts in the underlying group are not covered by the group of reinsurance contracts held.

Reinsurance contracts - subsequent measurement

The Group measures the carrying amount of the liability for remaining coverage at the end of each reporting period as the liability for remaining coverage at the beginning of the period:

- Plus premiums received in the period;  
- Minus insurance acquisition cash flows, with the exception of property insurance product line for which the Group chooses to expense insurance acquisition cash flows as they occur;  
- Plus any amounts relating to the amortisation of the insurance acquisition cash flows recognised as an expense in the reporting period for the group;  
- Plus any adjustment to the financing component, where applicable;  
- Minus the amount recognised as insurance revenue for the services provided in the period; and  
- Minus any investment component paid or transferred to the liability for incurred claims.

The Group estimates the liability for incurred claims as the fulfilment cash flows related to incurred claims. The fulfilment cash flows incorporate, in an unbiased way, all reasonable and supportable information available without undue cost or effort about the amount, timing and uncertainty of those future cash flows, they reflect current estimates from the perspective of the Group, and include an explicit adjustment for non-financial risk (the risk adjustment). The Group does not adjust the future cash flows for the time value of money and the effect of financial risk for the measurement of liability for incurred claims that are expected to be paid within one year of being incurred.

Where, during the coverage period, facts and circumstances indicate that a group of insurance contracts is onerous, the Group recognises a loss in profit or loss for the net outflow, resulting in the carrying amount of the liability for the group being equal to the fulfilment cash flows. A loss component is established by the Group for the liability for remaining coverage for such onerous group depicting the losses recognised.

Where the Group has established a loss-recovery component, the Group subsequently reduces the loss recovery component to zero in line with reductions in the onerous group of underlying insurance contracts in order to reflect that the loss-recovery component shall not exceed the portion of the carrying amount of the loss component of the onerous group of underlying insurance contracts that the entity expects to recover from the group of reinsurance contracts held.

Presentation

The Group has presented separately, in the statement of financial position, the carrying amounts of portfolios of reinsurance contracts issued that are assets in Note 21 and portfolios of reinsurance contracts held that are liabilities in Note 23.

# 23 PAYABLES

# Accounting Policy

Trade and other payables

Trade and other payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Other payables generally arise from transactions outside the usual operating activities of the Group and the Company. Trade and other payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer). If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.

Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, which is the fair value of the consideration to be paid in the future for the goods and services received.

# Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group and the Company have present legal or constructive obligations as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligations and reliable estimates of the amounts can be made. Where the Group and the Company expect a provision to be reimbursed by another party, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.

# Insurance contract liabilities

The accounting policy on insurance contract liabilities are disclosed in Note 21.

# 24 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

# Accounting Policy

The Group and the Company have various post-employment benefit schemes which are either defined contribution or defined benefit plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group and the Company pay fixed contributions into a separate entity (a fund) on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis and the Group and the Company have no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees benefits relating to employee services in the current and prior periods.

# Defined contribution plans

The Group's and the Company's contributions to the defined contribution plans are charged to the statement of profit or loss in the financial year to which they relate. Once the contributions have been paid, the Group and the Company have no further payment obligations.

# Defined benefit plans

The Group and the Company make contributions to the Group's and Company's Retirement Benefit Plan, a defined benefit plan and an approved fund independent of the Group's and Company's finances. A book provision is also provided by the Group and the Company as the contribution rate required to fund the benefits under the said plan is in excess of the Inland Revenue maximum limit. The Group and the Company also provided for a Post-Retirement Medical Plan for certain employees, which is unfunded.

The liability in respect of a defined benefit plan is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the statement of financial position date minus the fair value of plan assets. The Group and the Company determine the present value of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of any plan assets with sufficient regularity such that the amounts recognised in the financial statements do not differ materially from the amounts that would be determined at the end of the reporting date.

# 24 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (CONTINUED)

# Accounting Policy (continued)

Defined benefit plans (continued)

The defined benefit obligation, calculated using the Projected Unit Credit Method, is determined by an independent actuarial firm, considering the estimated future cash outflows using market yields at the statement of financial position date of high-quality corporate bonds which have currency and terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related liability.

The current service cost of the defined benefit plan reflects the increase in the defined benefit obligation resulting from employee services in the current year. It is recognised in the statement of profit or loss as employee benefits expense.

The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefits obligation and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is included in employee benefit expense in the statement of profit or loss. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised directly to the OCI in the period in which they arise. The actuarial gains and losses are not subsequently reclassified to the statement of profit or loss.

(i) Retirement Benefit Trust Fund ('RBTF')

The Group and the Company operate a final salary defined benefit plan. The benefit is made as lump sum payment at retirement or earlier exits due to death and early retirement. Currently, there is no minimum funding requirement under the law.

The RBTF exposes the Group and the Company to risks from interest rates from defined benefit being greater than expected due to assumptions such as salary increment or turnover rates not being borne out. The RBTF is also exposed to investment risks in relation to the assets of the plan. Any surplus in RBTF is only recognised to the extent that it may be used to reduce any future contributions to be paid by the Group and the Company, with remeasurement gains or losses to be recognised to the OCI as a gain or loss on asset ceiling.

The funding of the RBTF is based on recommendation of the actuary and approved by the Group and the Company. The employees are not required to contribute to the plan.

The Group expects to contribute  $7.0\%$  (2023:  $6.0\%$ ) of the annual basic salaries of members to the plan in the next financial year. As the fund is in a surplus, the Company is in the process of stopping contributions to the plan.

(ii) Post-Retirement Medical Benefit Scheme ('PRMBS')

The Group and the Company operate a post-retirement medical benefits plan in Malaysia. The PRMBS is closed to new entrants effective on 1 September 1998 and 1 September 1990 for the Group and the Company, respectively. There is no minimum funding requirement under the current law. The PRMBS is unfunded.

The PRMBS exposes the Group and the Company to risks from interest rates and from defined benefits being greater than expected due to assumptions such as projection of medical benefit costs and mortality not being borne out.

There has not been any settlement or curtailment during the current financial year.

# 25 CONSUMER DEPOSITS

Consumers served by TNB in Peninsular Malaysia and SESB in Sabah and the Federal Territory of Labuan are required to deposit a sum sufficient to cover charges for two months' supply of electricity as allowed under the regulation of the Licensee Supply (Amendment) Regulations 2002 (with the exception of employees, government departments/agencies and recipients of government assistance program for eKasih Group). In default of payment of the deposit within the time specified, the supply to the consumer's installation may be disconnected, subject to certain conditions laid out in the regulations.

An interest of  $2.5\%$  per annum is credited to the consumer's cash deposit.

Consumer deposits are classified as current liabilities as the amounts shall be refunded within 30 days upon request for termination of electricity supply by the consumer.

# 26 BORROWINGS

# Accounting Policy

Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods, borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, any differences between proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value are recognised in the statement of profit or loss over the period of the borrowings.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group and the Company have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the statement of financial position date.

Where the terms of a financial liability are renegotiated and the Group issues equity instruments to a debt holder to extinguish all or part of the liability (debt for equity swap), a gain or loss is recognised in statement of profit or loss, which is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability and the fair value of the equity instruments issued, if any.

Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facilities will be drawdown. The transaction costs are amortised over the tenure of the loan and recognised in the statement of profit or loss.

Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the statement of profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.

Government loans, where the interest rate is below the market interest rate, the differential between the initial carrying value of the loan based on market rate and the Government rate is recognised as a deferred income and is credited to the statement of profit or loss over the period necessary to match the interest costs.

Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.

(iii) Term Loans - SESB Federal Government Loans

The Federal Government provided RM2,028.1 million loans to SESB from 6 January 2003 to 11 April 2016 to finance the development project under the Malaysia Plan and electricity infrastructure development and upgrading projects in the state of Sabah. These loans have tenures ranging from 20 to 25 years, bearing applicable fixed interest rates of between  $0\%$  to  $4.0\%$  per annum.

The loans are secured by the following:

(a) A debenture creating:

- a first fixed charge over all present and future freehold and leasehold properties including all buildings and fixtures; and  
- a first floating charge over all present and future assets of SESB not effectively charged by way of the fixed charge.

(b) A deed of assignment transferring all SESB's present and future rights and interests in all sales proceeds or revenue derived from the sale of electricity generated from the projects funded.  
(c) A deed of assignment transferring all SESB's present and future rights and interests in the bank accounts in which the loan proceeds are credited.

Restructuring of Ninth Malaysia Plan loan

On 10 January 2024, the lender agreed with SESB to restructure the loan by extending the loan tenure by an additional 13 years. The revised loan schedule incorporated the capitalisation of accrued interest and late payment penalties up to 1 November 2023.

On 23 December 2024, SESB signed the restructured loan agreement with the lender under the revised terms and accounted for the transaction as an extinguishment of financial liabilities. The derecognition of the existing loan and the recognition of a new loan resulted in a gain on extinguishment loan of RM123.4 million. SESB also assessed the impact on the government development grant which represents the interest rate differential between the market and the Government loan rate, resulting in a loss on restructuring of RM49.2 million, as disclosed in Note 27. The new financing facility, amounting to RM1.4 billion, carries a fixed profit rate of  $4.0\%$  and matures on 31 March 2044.

# Loan moratorium

On 18 December 2024, SESB received an approval in principle from the lender for a moratorium on the repayment of nine loan instalments that were due in December 2024. Pursuant to the moratorium being granted, the Group continued to classify these borrowings in accordance with the existing repayment schedules, which remained effective until revised repayment schedule for the remainder of the loan facilities are agreed.

On 19 July 2017, TSS entered into a 20-year secured Istisna' Term Financing-i for a maximum principal of RM280.0 million to finance the construction of a 50MW solar power plant in Kuala Langat. The profit rate is based on Kuala Lumpur Interbank Offered Rate ('KLIBOR') plus a prevailing margin per annum. The financing is secured over the cash flows generated from the power plant and has a maturity date of 30 June 2037.

The term loan requires TSS to maintain certain financial covenants.

(v) Term Loan - TBSS

On 13 December 2018, TBSS secured a RM135.0 million Islamic Facility Agreement from MUFG Bank (Malaysia) Berhad to finance the construction of a 30MW solar power plant in Bukit Selambau, Kedah.

# 31 REVENUE

# Accounting Policy

Revenue which represents income arising in the course of the Group's and the Company's ordinary activities is recognised by reference to each distinct performance obligation promised in the contracts with customers. Revenue from contracts with customers is measured at its transaction price, being the amount of consideration which the Group and the Company expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, net of goods and service tax, returns, rebates and discounts. Transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on the basis of the relative stand-alone selling prices of each distinct good or services promised in the contract. Depending on the substance of the respective contract with the customer, revenue is recognised when the performance obligation is satisfied, which may be at a point in time or over time.

The Group and the Company do not expect any contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year. As a consequence, the Group and the Company do not adjust any of the transaction prices for the time value of money.

# (a) Electricity revenue

Revenue from the supply of electricity in Peninsular Malaysia (since 2014), Sabah and the Federal Territory of Labuan (since 2022) is regulated based on certain formulae and parameters as set out in the regulatory implementation guidance under the IBR framework and as agreed with the regulators. The allowed revenue in each year is calculated as the sum of actual revenue earned and any applicable adjustments, such as those related to the Annual Regulatory Adjustment ('ARA'), allowance or top-up by the Government and other income adjustment mechanisms as described in the Guidelines on Electricity Tariff Determination.

The contract with customers is for the supply of electricity based on tariff rates as set out in the provision of the Electricity Supply Act 1990. Collection of the contract consideration from customers is considered probable.

The promise to supply electricity represents a promise to transfer a series of distinct goods that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. The performance obligation to deliver electricity is satisfied over time as the customers simultaneously received and consumed the benefits provided by the Group's and the Company's performance. Hence, electricity revenue is recognised over time by the Group and the Company when electricity is consumed by customers.

Generally, customers are billed monthly. As the amount at which the Group and the Company have a right to invoice corresponds directly with the value to the customer, the revenue from electricity sales is also recognised monthly. Payment should be made by customers within 30 days from the date the bill is issued. An interest charge will be imposed if payment is made later than 30 days after the bill date.

Electricity revenue includes an estimated value of the electricity consumed by customers from the date of their last meter reading and the reporting period end. Accrued unbilled revenues recognised as contract assets are reversed in the following month when actual billings occur.

Other income which is earned from services not directly related to electricity supply but are provided using the assets and/or staff of a licensee is deducted from the revenues to be earned from regulated tariffs.

# (b) Goods and services

# (i) Sale of goods

Sale of goods is recognised when control of the products has transferred, being when the products are delivered to the customer and there is no unfulfilled obligation that could affect the customer's acceptance of the products. Delivery occurs when the products have been transported to the specific location, the risks of obsolescence and loss have been transferred to the customer, and either the customer has accepted the products in accordance with the sales contract, the acceptance provisions have lapsed, or the Group has objective evidence that all criteria for acceptance have been satisfied.

# 31 REVENUE (CONTINUED)

# Accounting Policy (continued)

(b) Goods and services (continued)

(i) Sale of goods (continued)

Revenue from these sales is recognised based on the price specified in the contract, net of the estimated discounts. Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for the discounts, using the expected value method, and revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. No element of financing is deemed present as the sales are made with a credit term of an average between 30 to 60 days, which is consistent with market practice. The Group's obligation to repair or replace faulty products under the standard warranty terms is recognised as a provision.

A receivable is recognised when the goods are delivered as this is the point in time that the consideration is unconditional because only the passage of time is required before the payment is due.

(ii) Rendering of services

Revenue from providing services is recognised over the period in which the services are rendered. Revenue is recognised based on the actual service provided to the end of the reporting period as a proportion of the total services to be provided because the customer received and uses the benefits simultaneously.

In cases of fixed-price contracts, the customer pays the fixed amount based on a payment schedule. If the services rendered exceed the payments, a contract asset is recognised. If the payments exceed the services rendered, a contract liability is recognised.

If the contract includes hourly fees, revenue is recognised at the amount to which the Group has a right to invoice. The amounts are billed within 60 to 180 days from satisfying the performance obligations and payment is expected within 30 days from the billing date.

(c) Construction contracts

Revenue from construction contracts is recognised over time or at a point in time in accordance with performance obligations being satisfied. Where revenue is recognised over time, the satisfaction of performance obligation is by reference to the stage of completion which is assessed by reference to the contract costs incurred over the total estimated costs for each contract as at the reporting date. Otherwise, revenue is recognised at a point in time when the customer obtains control of the assets. The related costs are recognised in the statement of profit or loss when they are incurred.

Where the contracts include multiple performance obligations, the transaction price will be allocated to each performance obligation based on the stand-alone selling prices. Where these are not directly observable, they are estimated based on expected cost plus margin. If contracts include sale of goods as a separate performance obligation, revenue from this sale is recognised at a point in time when the goods are delivered, the legal title has passed and the customer has accepted the goods.

When the consideration of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised only to the extent of contract costs incurred that are likely to be recoverable. An expected loss on a contract is recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss.

Estimates of revenues, costs or extent of progress toward completion are revised if circumstances change. Any resulting increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs are reflected in the statement of profit or loss in the period in which the circumstances that give rise to the revision become known by management.

The amounts will be billed within 60 to 180 days from satisfying the performance obligations and payment is expected within 30 days from billing date. Advances received are included in contract liabilities.

# 31 REVENUE (CONTINUED)

# Accounting Policy (continued)

# (d) Customers' contributions

Contributions received from customers in the form of cash and/or PPE in respect of capital contributions for the construction of assets, used to connect the customers to a network or to provide them with the service, is included in the revenue.

The customers' contributions are viewed as indirectly related to the promise of providing supply of electricity to the customers. Supply of electricity and customers' contributions are not distinct because the customers cannot benefit from these two services on their own. The connection infrastructures are to fulfil the obligation to supply electricity to the customers. Both the supply of electricity and customers' contributions are substantially the same, and have the same pattern of transfer to the customers.

Therefore, connection and the supply of electricity are one performance obligation. It is considered as part of the transaction price for the overall service provided to the customers and is recognised over time. The customers' contributions are deferred and recognised over the period the constructed assets are used to provide electricity to the customers. The contributions are recognised as contract liabilities and amortised over 20 years, being the estimated average useful life of the assets.

# (e) Insurance contract revenue

Insurance revenue is recognised based on the expected premium receipts and the passage of time over the coverage period of a group of contracts unless the release of risk differs significantly from the passage of time, in which case insurance revenue is recognised based on the release of risk.

Disaggregation of revenue for the Group and the Company are categorised as follows:

The disaggregation of the revenue of the Group and of the Company by location is disclosed in Note 44.

# 32 IMBALANCE COST PASS-THROUGH ('ICPT') UNDER RECOVERY

# Accounting Policy

ICPT, a mechanism established under the IBR framework allows the Group and the Company to pass through the volatility in fuel and other generation specific costs (termed as the 'Single Buyer Generation Cost') to the customers, such that the Group and the Company remain financially neutral. The Group's and the Company's claims and undertakings under the ICPT mechanism are such that any over or under recovery of these costs would be payable to or reimbursable from the Government. Upon approval by the Government, the agreed over or under recovery of these costs will be adjusted in the billing to customers, as ICPT rebate or surcharge or reimbursable by Government. Actual base tariff billed to the customers remains unchanged.

The ICPT over or under recovery is recognised in the statement of profit or loss, presented separately from revenue.

# LTIP

The Group and the Company operate an equity-settled share-based compensation plan under which the entity receives services from employees as consideration for equity instruments of the Group.

The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the Company's shares is recognised as an expense in the statement of profit or loss over the vesting period of the grant, with a corresponding increase in share-based payment reserve in equity.

The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares granted.

Non-market vesting conditions are included in the assumptions to arrive at the number of shares that are expected to vest. At the end of the reporting period, the Company revises its estimates of the number of shares that are expected to be vested. The impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, is recognised in the statement of profit or loss, with a corresponding adjustment to share-based payment reserve in equity.

The fair value of shares granted to employees of subsidiaries is allocated to the subsidiaries.

The Company implemented a LTIP on 30 April 2015 for a period of 10 years. The LTIP is governed by the by-laws, which was approved by the shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting on 18 December 2014. LTIP is intended to allow the Company to award the grant of new shares to be vested to selected employees for the attainment of identified performance objectives.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# 34 STAFF COST (CONTINUED)

LTIP (continued)

(a) The main features of the LTIP

The LTIP comprises a Restricted Share Grant ('RS Grant') and a Performance Share Grant ('PS Grant'). The main difference in the features of the RS Grant and the PS Grant is the eligibility of the selected employees in terms of their job grades in the Group and the performance targets and/or performance conditions to be met prior to the offer and vesting of the grant to the selected employees.

The details of the grant are as follows:

(i) RS Grant

The RS Grant is a restricted share grant for all eligible employees selected on a basis designated by the LTIP Committee. The RS Grant will be awarded annually to the selected employees to be vested over a period of 3 years on a pro-rata basis and after fulfilment of individual performance targets based on the Group's performance management system (such as individual performance rating) and certain performance conditions (such as financial targets) as determined by the LTIP Committee from time to time at its discretion in accordance with the terms and conditions of the LTIP.

(ii) PS Grant

The PS Grant is a performance share grant for senior executives of the Group and the Executive Director as well as key employees of the Group selected on a basis designated by the LTIP Committee. The PS Grant will be awarded annually to the selected employees to be vested at the end of the 3-year period and after fulfilment of certain performance targets and/or conditions at the time of grant and vesting, which may include, among other factors, total shareholders' return and the long term financial performance targets/ratios of the Group as determined by the LTIP Committee from time to time at its discretion in accordance with the terms and conditions of the LTIP. At the point of vesting, the final award of the PS Grant is based on a multiple of the initial grant whereby the multiple is determined according to the performance targets and/or conditions. In the event the performance targets and/or conditions are not met by the selected employees, the grant will not be vested to them at the end of the performance period.

The new ordinary shares to be allotted and issued upon the vesting of the ordinary shares pursuant to the RS Grant and PS Grant will not be subjected to any retention period or restriction on transfer.

In implementing the LTIP, the grant will be satisfied by way of allotment and issuance of new ordinary shares to the respective RS and PS grantees upon vesting of the grant.

The LTIP Committee shall decide from time to time at its discretion to determine or vary the terms and conditions of the offer, such as the eligibility criteria and allocation in each grant, the timing and frequency of the award of the grant, the performance targets and/or performance conditions to be met prior to the offer and vesting of the grant and the vesting period.

(b) Maximum number of new ordinary shares available under the LTIP

The maximum number of new ordinary shares which may be made available under the LTIP and/or allotted and issued upon vesting of the new ordinary shares under the LTIP shall not be more than  $10.0\%$  of the issued and paid-up ordinary share capital of the Company (excluding treasury shares) at any point in time during the duration of the LTIP.

# 34 STAFF COST (CONTINUED)

LTIP (continued)

(c) Basis of allocation and maximum allowable allotment

The total number of new ordinary shares that may be offered to any one of the selected employees and/or to be vested in any one of the grantees under the LTIP at any time shall be at the discretion of the LTIP Committee (subject to the by-laws and any applicable law).

(d) Eligibility

Employees of the Group and of the Company (including the Executive Director) who meet the following criteria as at the date of offer shall be eligible to be considered as an eligible employee to participate in the LTIP:

(i) Has attained the age of 18 years;  
(ii) Has entered into a full-time or fixed-term contract of employment with, and is on the payroll of any company within the Group and has not served a notice of resignation or received a notice of termination;  
(iii) Whose service/employment has been confirmed in writing;  
(iv) Is not a non-executive or independent director of the Company, and  
(v) Has fulfilled any other eligibility criteria which has been determined by the LTIP Committee at its discretion from time to time, as the case may be.

The LTIP Committee may determine any other eligibility criteria for the purpose of selecting an eligible employee at any time and from time to time, at its discretion.

(e) Ranking of the new ordinary shares

The new ordinary shares to be allotted and issued pursuant to the LTIP shall, upon allotment and issuance, rank equally in all respects with the then existing issued ordinary shares.

# 36 FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAIN/(LOSS)

# Accounting Policy

(a) Functional and presentation currency

Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the 'functional currency'). The financial statements are presented in Ringgit Malaysia ('RM'), which is the Company's functional and presentation currency.

(b) Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are remeasured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the statement of profit or loss. However, exchange differences are deferred in OCI when they are attributable to items that form part of the net investment in a foreign operation.

(c) Group companies

The results and financial positions of the Group's entities that have functional currencies which are different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:

(i) Assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that statement of financial position;  
(ii) Income and expenses for each statement of profit or loss and OCI are translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions); and  
(iii) All resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate. Exchange differences arising on these items are recognised in OCI.

On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are taken to shareholders' equity.

On the disposal of a foreign operation (that is, a disposal of the Group's entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, a disposal involving loss of joint control over a joint venture that includes a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of significant influence over an associate that includes a foreign operation), the cumulative amount of the exchange differences relating to that foreign operation recognised in OCI, and accumulated in the separate component of equity, are reclassified from equity to statement of profit or loss, as part of the gain or loss on disposal.

# 37 FINANCE INCOME/COST AND FAIR VALUE CHANGES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

# Accounting Policy

Finance income are interests received from investments or financial instruments.

Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowing pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.

Finance income is calculated by applying the effective interest method to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset except for financial assets that subsequently become credit impaired. For credit-impaired financial assets the effective interest rate is applied to the net carrying amount of the financial assets (after deduction of the loss allowances).

The accounting policy on fair value changes are as per disclosed in Note 45.

General and specific borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised during the period of time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use. Qualifying assets are assets that necessarily takes substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use. Other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.

Accounting policy on finance charges for lease liabilities and government grants are disclosed in Note 15 and Note 27, respectively.

# 38 TAXATION AND ZAKAT

# Accounting Policy

# (a) Income tax

Current tax expense is determined by the expected income taxes payable in respect of the taxable profit for the financial year and is measured using the applicable tax rates according to the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period in the countries in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate the taxable profits.

Management periodically evaluates the positions taken in its tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation. Provisions are established where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.

Tax is recognised in the statement of profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in OCI. In this case, the item is recognised in OCI, net of tax.

The Group and the Company recognise non-current tax recoverable on an undiscounted basis.

International Tax Reform (Pillar 2 Model Rules)

The Group adopted the 'International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules (amendments to MFRS 112)'. The amendments provide a temporary mandatory exception from deferred tax accounting for the top-up tax, which is effective immediately and require new disclosures about the Pillar Two exposure.

Pillar Two legislation has been enacted or substantively enacted in a number of locations where the Group operates including the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Australia and Luxembourg. These legislations were effective for the Group's financial year beginning 1 January 2024. Pillar Two legislation has also been enacted in Malaysia, but these rules will only be effective from 1 January 2025.

The Group has performed an assessment of the Group's potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes, based on the most recent historical information available regarding the financial performance of the Group, as if Pillar Two rules were effective in 2024 for all jurisdictions in which the Group operates. Based on the assessment performed, the Group met the transitional safe harbour relief for all jurisdictions in which the Group operates. Consequently, the Group does not estimate a material exposure derived from the new Pillar Two rules, without prejudice to the relevant administrative burdens that will entail its implementation and numerous areas of uncertainty in the interpretation of the Pillar Two rules.

# (b)Zakat

The Group and the Company recognise its obligation towards the payment of zakat on business income in the statement of profit or loss. Zakat payment is an obligation and is accrued based on  $2.5\%$  of profit before tax and determined according to the percentage of Muslim shareholding in the Company.

# 42 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND MATERIAL LITIGATIONS

# Accounting Policy

The Group and the Company do not recognise contingent assets and liabilities other than those arising from business combinations but disclose its existence in the financial statements. A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Group and of the Company or a present obligation that is not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation. A contingent liability also arises in the extremely rare case where there is a liability that cannot be recognised because it cannot be measured reliably. However, contingent liabilities do not include financial guarantee contracts. A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events whose existence will be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Group and of the Company. The Group and the Company do not recognise contingent assets but disclose its existence where inflows of economic benefits are probable, but not certain.

Determination of the treatment of contingent liabilities is based on the Group's and the Company's view of the expected outcome of the contingencies after consulting legal counsel for litigation cases and internal and external experts to the Group and the Company for matters in the ordinary course of business.

# Material litigations

# (a) Reinvestment allowance ('RIA')

On 7 December 2016, the Company and the Inland Revenue Board of Malaysia ('IRB') entered into a consent judgement before the Kuala Lumpur High Court to substitute judicial review proceedings for notices of additional assessment dated 23 November 2015 for Years of Assessment ('YA') 2013 and 2014 amounting to RM2,068.2 million (referred to as 'Notices 1') arising from the disallowance of the Company's RIA claims. The consent judgement also stipulates that the IRB will not commence any proceedings relating to the Notices 1 until the matter is determined by the Special Commissioners of Income Tax ('SCIT') and the High Court, if there is a subsequent appeal by either party. On 15 December 2016, the Company filed appeals against the Notices 1 to the SCIT according to Section 99(1) of the Income Tax Act 1967, which have since been registered before the SCIT. However, the trial at SCIT is adjourned, pending the Federal Court's decision in relation to the notice of additional assessment for YA 2018.

# 42 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND MATERIAL LITIGATIONS (CONTINUED)

Material litigations (continued)

(a) RIA (continued)

Meanwhile, for the notices of additional assessment issued for YAs 2015, 2016, and 2017 amounting to RM3,977.9 million (referred to as 'Notices 2'), both the Company and the IRB recorded a consent order for judicial review application before the High Court on 30 December 2020. On 22 August 2023, the High Court allowed the Company's judicial review application to set aside the Notices 2. The High Court agreed that the Company is in the business of manufacturing electricity and as such, the Company is entitled to claim RIA on the capital expenditures which were incurred in YAs 2015, 2016 and 2017 in the course of expanding, modernising and automating its business. In response, on 25 August 2023, the IRB filed a notice of appeal against the High Court's decision. However, the hearing before the Court of Appeal is adjourned, pending the Federal Court's decision in relation to the notice of additional assessment for YA 2018.

With regards to the notice of additional assessment for YA 2018 amounting to RM1,812.5 million (referred to as 'Notice 3'), both the Company and the IRB recorded a consent order for judicial review application before the High Court on 21 January 2021. On 8 February 2022, the High Court allowed with cost, the Company's judicial review application to set aside the Notice 3. Separately, on 8 February 2022, the IRB filed a notice of appeal against the High Court decision. On 16 May 2024, the Court of Appeal dismissed the IRB's appeal against the decision of the High Court in allowing the Company's judicial review application to set aside the Notice 3. Both courts agreed that the Company is in the business of manufacturing electricity and as such, the Company is entitled to claim RIA on the capital expenditure which was incurred in YA 2018 in the course of expanding, modernising, and automating its business. IRB filled a Notice of Appeal on 12 September 2024, and the Federal Court has fixed the hearing date for the appeal on 4 February 2025. Pursuant to the hearing held, the Court, after considering the submissions of the parties, has reserved its judgement to a later date. The date of the judgement will be duly communicated to the Company in due course.

On 19 August 2024, the Company received notices of additional assessment for YAs 2020 and 2021 (referred to as 'Notices 4') amounting to RM1,391.0 million that are similar in nature to the above-mentioned Notices 1, 2, and 3. The Company has filed the judicial review application on 5 September 2024 before the High Court. Separately, on 25 September 2024, the High Court has fixed the hearing date on 29 April 2025.

Notwithstanding the outcome of the court proceedings, IRB had agreed to remit all penalties imposed for YAs 2013 to 2018, totalling RM2,438.9 million, in accordance with the signed consent orders in respect of the judicial review proceedings for YAs 2015 to 2017 and YA 2018. The potential tax liability was RM6,810.7 million after the remission of penalties. Nonetheless, the total net cash outflow exposure is estimated at RM5,053.5 million after taking into account the amount paid to IRB in December 2020 of RM1,757.2 million in relation to YAs 2016 and 2017.

The Company has obtained legal advice from its tax solicitors on the merits of the cases mentioned above and on this basis, the Directors are of the opinion that there is no provision is required in the financial statements for the potential tax liability up to the reporting date. Notwithstanding with the above, the Company continued to claim the RIA for YAs 2022, 2023 and will claim in 2024 as permitted by the law.

(b) SPC

On 26 May 2023, the IRB issued notices of assessment for YAs 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 amounting in aggregate to RM78.5 million to SPC.

On 6 June 2023, SPG filed a judicial review against the IRB at the High Court to challenge the matters arising from the above-mentioned notices. Subsequently, on 14 September 2023, the High Court granted leave to SPG to commence judicial review against the IRB and granted an interim stay of all further proceedings including the enforcement until the substantive hearing on 11 January 2024. Due to an ongoing discussion with a view to a proposed settlement with the IRB, the substantive hearing was vacated. The IRB has stated that they have no objection to the interim stay being granted and the Court allowed for the adjournment. The High Court proceeded to fix a new case management date on 21 March 2025 to fix a hearing date and update in the extension of interim stay.

Based on the legal advice obtained from its tax solicitors on the merits of the case, SPC is of the view that no provision is required for the potential tax liability up to the reporting date.

On 31 December 2024, TNBWE filed a judicial review application at the High Court to challenge matters arising from the above-mentioned notice. On 9 January 2025, the High Court granted an interim stay on all further proceedings, including the enforcement, until the full and final disposal of the judicial review leave application. The High Court has scheduled the leave hearing on 14 April 2025. Based on the legal advice obtained from its tax solicitors on the merits of the case, TNBWE is of the view that no provision is required for the potential tax liability up to the reporting date.

There is no other pending material litigation other than those announced to Bursa Malaysia since the date of the last audited financial statements.

# 45 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

# Accounting Policy

Financial instruments comprise financial assets and financial liabilities as below:

# Financial assets

# (a) Classification

The Group and the Company classify their financial assets in the following categories: at amortised cost ('AC'), at FVOCI or FVTPL. The classification depends on the entity's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows.

(i) Financial assets at AC:

- The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash flows; and  
- The contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest.

(ii) Financial assets at FVOCI:

- Equity securities which are not held for trading, and which the Group and the Company have irrevocably elected at initial recognition to recognise in this category. These are strategic investments and the Group and the Company consider this classification to be more relevant; and  
- Debt securities where the contractual cash flows are solely principal and interest and the objective of the Group's and of the Company's business model is achieved both by collecting cash flows and selling financial assets.

(iii) Financial assets at FVTPL:

- Debt instruments that do not qualify for measurement at either AC or FVOCI;  
Equity instruments that are held for trading; and  
Equity instruments for which the Group and the Company have not elected to recognise fair value gains and losses through OCI.

The Group and the Company reclassify debt instruments when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes.

# (b) Recognition and derecognition

Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade-date, the date on which the Group and the Company commit to purchase or sell the assets. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group and the Company have transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.

# (c) Measurement

# (i) Initial recognition

On initial recognition, the Group and the Company measure a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVTPL are expensed in the statement of profit or loss.

Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest.

# Accounting Policy (continued)

Financial assets (continued)

(c) Measurement (continued)

(ii) Subsequent measurement

- Debt instruments

Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group's and the Company's business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories into which the Group and the Company classify its debt instruments:

- AC: Interest income from financial assets at AC is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in the statement of profit or loss. Impairment losses are presented as a separate line item in the statement of profit or loss.

- FVOCI: Movements in the carrying amount of debt instruments classified under FVOCI are taken through OCI. Upon derecognition of the assets, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified to the statement of profit or loss. The interest income from these financial assets is included in the finance income using the effective interest rate method. The foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment expenses are presented as a separate line item in the statement of profit or loss.

- FVTPL: Financial assets that do not meet the criteria for AC or FVOCI are measured at FVTPL. A gain or loss on debt instruments which are measured at FVTPL are recognised in the statement of profit or loss.

Equity instruments

The Group and the Company have elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity instruments in OCI. The fair value gains and losses of these instruments will not be reclassified subsequently to the statement of profit or loss. Dividends from such investments are recognised in the statement of profit or loss as other income. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) on equity instruments measured at FVOCI are also reported as other changes in fair value.

(d) Impairment

The Group and the Company assess on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments carried at AC and FVOCI. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.

The Group and the Company have the following financial instruments that are subject to the ECL model:

(i) Trade receivables  
(ii) Trade contract assets  
(iii) Non-trade receivables:

intercompany balances  
- amounts due from associates/joint ventures  
- rechargeable job orders ('RJO') debtors  
· sundry deposits for rental spaces  
· rental receivables  
staff loans/advances  
investment in unquoted debt securities

(iv) Financial guarantee contracts issued

While cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirements of MFRS 9, the identified impairment loss is immaterial.

Financial instruments comprise financial assets and financial liabilities as below: (continued)

Financial assets (continued)

(d) Impairment (continued)

ECL represents a probability-weighted estimate of the difference between the present value of the cash flows according to the contract and present value of the cash flows the Group and the Company are expected to receive, over the remaining life of the financial instruments. For financial guarantee contracts, the ECL is the difference between the expected payments to be reimbursed to the holder of the guaranteed debt instrument less any amounts that the Company expects to receive from the holder, the debtor or any other party.

The measurement of ECL reflects:

(i) An unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes;  
(ii) The time value of money; and  
(iii) Reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.

For trade receivables, trade contract assets and lease receivables, the Group and the Company apply the MFRS 9 simplified approach, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables, except for those which are in default or credit impaired are assessed individually.

For non-trade receivables, at each reporting date the Group and the Company measure ECL through a loss allowance at an amount equal to 12 months ECL if credit risk on a financial instrument or a group of financial instruments has not increased significantly since initial recognition.

The Group and the Company use the three-stage approach for non-trade receivables which reflect their credit risk and how the loss allowances are determined for each of those stages. Summary of the assumptions underpinning the Group's and the Company's ECL model for non-trade receivables are as follows:

<table><tr><td>Types of non-trade receivables</td><td>Stage 1Low credit risk(12 months ECL Model)</td><td>Stage 2Significant increase in credit risk (Lifetime ECL Model)</td><td>Stage 3Credit impaired (Lifetime ECL Model)</td></tr><tr><td>·Intercompany balances</td><td>Positive operating cash flows/ Net assets (Total Assets – Total Liabilities)/ Subsidiaries with assets under construction having guaranteed long term revenue contract and agents</td><td>Negative operating cash flows and net liabilities (Total Assets – Total Liabilities)/ without defaulting on loan repayments</td><td>Dormant/History of default</td></tr><tr><td>·Amounts due from associates/joint ventures/investment in unquoted debt security</td><td>Positive operating cash flows/Net assets (Total Assets – Total Liabilities)</td><td>Negative operating cash flows and net liabilities (Total Assets – Total Liabilities)/No current default</td><td>History of default and currently defaulted</td></tr><tr><td>·RJO debtors</td><td>Covered by indent/ downpayment/Letter of Undertaking (&#x27;LOU&#x27;)</td><td>No indent/downpayment/LOU</td><td>Accident cases</td></tr><tr><td>·Sundry deposits for rental spaces</td><td>Active contracts</td><td>Inactive contracts and amounts outstanding less or equal to 12 months</td><td>Inactive contracts and amounts outstanding more than 12 months</td></tr></table>

The Group and the Company use the three-stage approach for non-trade receivables which reflect their credit risk and how the loss allowances are determined for each of those stages. Summary of the assumptions underpinning the Group's and the Company's ECL model for non-trade receivables are as follows: (continued)

When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECL, the Group and the Company consider reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Group's and the Company's historical experience and informed credit assessment including forward looking information, where available.

The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or fully) to the extent that there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when either the Group or the Company determine that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subjected to the write-off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group's and the Company's procedures for recovery of amounts due.

# Financial liabilities

The Group and the Company classify its financial liabilities at AC or at FVTPL.

# Offsetting financial instruments

Financial assets and liabilities are offsetted and the net amounts are presented in the statement of financial position when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy.

# 45 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)

# Accounting Policy (continued)

Financial guarantee contracts

Financial guarantee contracts are contracts that require the Group or the Company to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due, in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument.

Financial guarantee contracts are recognised as a financial liability at the time the guarantee is issued. The liability is initially measured at fair value and subsequently at the higher of;

(i) The amount determined in accordance with the ECL model; and  
(ii) The amount initially recognised less, where appropriate, the cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the principles of MFRS 15.

The fair value of financial guarantees is determined as the present value of the difference in net cash flows between the contractual payments under the debt instrument and the payments that would be required without the guarantee, or the estimated amount that would be payable to a third party for assuming the obligations.

Where guarantees in relation to loans or other payables of associates are provided for no compensation, the fair values are accounted for as contributions and recognised as part of the cost of the investment.

(b) Financial risk management

The Group and the Company have exposures to the following risks embedded in its financial instruments:

Credit risk;  
- Liquidity risk; and  
Market risk.

Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of a financial loss to the Group and the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. The Group's and the Company's exposures to credit risk arise principally from its receivables from customers, investment in unquoted debt security, deposits, bank and cash balances and derivative financial instruments. In addition, the Company's exposure to credit risk arises principally from loans and advances to subsidiaries and financial guarantees given to banks in respect of banking facilities granted to certain subsidiaries and an associate.

(i) Trade receivables and trade contract assets

Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk

The Group and the Company have a credit policy in place and the exposures to credit risk are monitored on an ongoing basis. Normally, financial guarantees given by banks, shareholders or directors of customers are obtained, and credit evaluations are performed on customers requiring credit over a certain amount.

Exposure to credit risk, credit quality and collateral

The Group's and the Company's credit policy provide trade receivables with a 30 to 90 days (2023: 30 to 90 days) credit period. The Group and the Company have no major significant concentration of credit risk due to their diverse customer base. An impairment has been made for estimated unrecoverable amounts, determined by reference to past default experience of individual debtors and collection portfolios.

The total trade receivables and trade contract assets and the impairment provided are as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">Group</td><td colspan="2">Company</td></tr><tr><td>2024

The Group and the Company apply MFRS 9 simplified approach to measure expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables and trade contract assets.

For certain large customers with high risk of default, the Group and the Company assessed the risk of loss for each customer individually based on their financial information, past trend of payments and external credit ratings, where applicable.

To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables and trade contract assets are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. The trade contract assets that relate to unbilled customers have substantial same risk characteristics as the trade receivables for the same types of contracts. The Group and the Company have therefore concluded that the expected loss rates for trade receivables are a reasonable approximation of the loss rates of the trade contract assets.

The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period of 14 months and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables. The Group and the Company have identified growth rates of real Gross Domestic Product ('GDP') of Malaysia to be the most relevant factor, and accordingly, adjusts the historical loss rates based on the expected changes in this factor. As at 31 December 2024, for non-government customers, a combination of growth rates of real GDP and inflation rates were identified as the most relevant factors.

On that basis, the loss allowance was determined for both trade receivables and trade contract assets as reflected in the earlier tables.

During the financial year, the collection trends of the Group's and the Company's trade receivables continued to improve. The Group and the Company revised the expected cash flows from their trade receivables which resulted in a reversal of impairment loss.

During the financial year, there has been a reversal of loss allowances due to debt restructuring of amount due from a trade debtor to long term as a result of improved cash flows by the trade debtor. The revised carrying amount and the loss on restructuring are as disclosed in Note 13(a) and 37(c) respectively.

The Group and the Company also written off the inactive trade receivables which had been fully impaired in the previous financial years, therefore there was no impact to the net trade receivables.

Trade receivables are secured by deposits in the form of cash and bank guarantees. ECL is not provided on receivable balances fully secured by deposits. The deposit amounts are reviewed on an individual basis periodically.

Individual receivables which were known to be uncollectible were written off by reducing the carrying amount directly.

Impairment losses on trade receivables and trade contract assets are presented as net impairment losses within operating profit. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the same line item.

Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk

Investments, deposits, bank and cash balances, derivative financial instruments and financial assets measured at FVTPL are liquid security and mainly with reputable financial institutions and electricity retailers.

Investment in unquoted debt security are investment in an associate's financial instruments. The credit risk of this associate is monitored on a quarterly basis and the loss allowances are provided for accordingly.

Exposure to credit risk, credit quality and collateral

The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amounts in the SOFP.

In view of the sound credit rating of counterparties, the Group and the Company do not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations. The Group and the Company do not have overdue investments that have not been impaired.

The investments, deposits, cash and bank balances and derivative financial instruments are unsecured.

Bank and cash balances are held with banks and financial institutions which have lower credit risks. In addition, some of the bank balances are insured by Government agencies. Consequently, the Group and the Company are of the view that the loss allowance is not material and hence, it is not provided for.

The total investment in unquoted debt security and the impairment provided are as follows:

# Impairment losses

Generally, the Company considers loans and advances to subsidiaries having low credit risk. The Company assumes that there is a significant increase in credit risk when a subsidiary's financial position deteriorates significantly based on stages determined in the accounting policy part (d) of this note. As the Company is able to determine the timing of payments of the subsidiaries' balances when they are payable, the Company considers the amount payable to be in default when the subsidiaries are not able to pay when demanded. The Company considers a subsidiary's balances to be impaired when the subsidiary is:

- unlikely to repay its payables to the Company in full;  
- having prolonged negative operating cash flows and is in net tangible liabilities position; or  
- a dormant entity or has a history of default.

At the end of the financial year, there was no indication that the amounts due from the subsidiaries are not recoverable other than those which have already been impaired. The Company does not specifically monitor the ageing of advances to the subsidiaries.

During the financial year, there has been reversal of loss allowances due to repayments received from subsidiaries.

The loss allowances for intercompany balances using the general 3-stage approach reconciled to the opening loss allowances for that provision are as follows:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Stage 1 RM&#x27;million</td><td>Stage 2 RM&#x27;million</td><td>Stage 3 RM&#x27;million</td><td>Total RM&#x27;million</td></tr><tr><td>2024</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>As at the beginning of the financial year</td><td>(230.8)</td><td>(208.3)</td><td>(134.1)</td><td>(573.2)</td></tr><tr><td>Impairment loss recognised</td><td>(18.8)</td><td>(202.3)</td><td>(19.3)</td><td>(240.4)</td></tr><tr><td>Impairment loss reversed</td><td>79.3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>79.3</td></tr><tr><td>Impairment written off</td><td>1.1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1.1</td></tr><tr><td>As at the end of the financial year</td><td>(169.2)</td><td>(410.6)</td><td>(153.4)</td><td>(733.2)</td></tr><tr><td>2023</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>As at the beginning of the financial year</td><td>(327.9)</td><td>(129.8)</td><td>(116.2)</td><td>(573.9)</td></tr><tr><td>Impairment loss recognised</td><td>(53.0)</td><td>(90.3)</td><td>(20.4)</td><td>(163.7)</td></tr><tr><td>Impairment loss reversed</td><td>150.1</td><td>11.8</td><td>1.1</td><td>163.0</td></tr><tr><td>Impairment written off</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1.4</td><td>1.4</td></tr><tr><td>As at the end of the financial year</td><td>(230.8)</td><td>(208.3)</td><td>(134.1)</td><td>(573.2)</td></tr></table>

Other non-trade receivables

Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk

Credit risk on other non-trade receivables are mainly arising from RJO debtors which are receivables from specific works requested by customers.

Credit risk also arises from sundry deposits for rental of office spaces from third parties and rental receivables. The Company manages the credit risk together with the specific leasing arrangements.

Staff advances and staff loans have low credit risk as these are mostly provided to existing staff. These balances are managed on a monthly basis.

Exposure to credit risk, credit quality and collateral

At the end of the financial year, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by their carrying amounts in the SOFP.

The Company receives down payments, LOUs or indents for RJO debtors where works are requested by customers. In cases of RJO debtors arising from accidental damages to the Company's assets whereby the third party is identifiable, these amounts are fully impaired as there is very low prospect of recovery.

The Company receives deposits from third parties for rental of office spaces.

(iv) Financial guarantees

Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk

The Company provides financial guarantees to banks in respect of banking facilities granted to certain subsidiaries and an associate. The Company monitors the ability of the subsidiaries and the associate to service their loans on an individual basis annually.

Exposure to credit risk, credit quality and collateral

The maximum exposure to the Group and the Company amounts to RM296.9 million (2023: RM312.1 million) and RM11,713.9 million (2023: RM11,534.8 million) respectively, representing banking facilities utilised by the subsidiaries and an associate as at the end of the financial year.

The financial guarantees are provided as credit enhancements to the subsidiaries' and associate's secured loans.

The total financial guarantees and loss allowances provided are as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">Group</td><td colspan="2">Company</td></tr><tr><td>2024

# Impairment losses

The Company assumes that there is a significant increase in credit risk when a subsidiary or associate has indication of defaulting on its banking facilities. The Company considers a financial guarantee to be credit impaired when the subsidiary or associate is unlikely to repay its credit obligation to the bank in full.

The Company determines the probability of default of the guaranteed loans individually using internal information available.

Loss allowance has been recognised mainly arising from the financial guarantee provided by the Group in 2016 to support the loan facility offered to Iç Anadolu Dogalgaz Elektrik Üretim ve Ticaret AŞ. ('ICAN'), a subsidiary of Gama Enerji Anonim Şirketi (Gama Enerji). The ECL is determined based on an internal assessment of Gama Enerji debt servicing ability taking into account of the current adverse macroeconomic conditions in Türkiye. The impairment loss for financial guarantees for the Group and the Company are in Stage 3.

# Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group and the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group's and the Company's exposures to liquidity risk arise principally from its various payables, loans and borrowings. The Group and the Company monitor rolling forecasts of the Group's and of the Company's liquidity requirements.

As of 31 December 2024, the Company's current liabilities exceeded their current assets by RM3,040.5 million (2023: RM2,120.3 million), mainly due to consumer deposits amounting to RM8,258.3 million (2023: RM7,659.6 million).

The Company's cash flow forecast for the next 12 months takes into account the expected revenue growth rates, customer collection trends, low rate of termination of electricity account that would crystallise the entire consumer deposits above and one-off transactions. The Company expects to be able to generate sufficient internal cash flows from operations for the next 12 months from the reporting date to meet operational and financing needs as and when they fall due.

In addition, as at 31 December 2024, the Company have undrawn borrowing facilities amounting to RM19,313.9 million (2023: RM14,011.4 million) to support any cash shortfall while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn borrowing facilities at all times to ensure the Company have the financial flexibility.

Surplus cash of the Group and of the Company is invested in profit bearing current accounts, money market deposits and other instruments with appropriate maturities and sufficient liquidity level to provide sufficient headroom as determined by the cash flow forecasts and to enable the Group and the Company to discharge liabilities in the normal course of business.

Market risk

Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and other prices will affect the Group's and the Company's financial positions or cash flows.

(i) Foreign currency risk

The Group and the Company are exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in currencies other than the respective functional currencies of the Group and of the Company. The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily USD, JPY and GBP.

Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk

The Group and the Company are required to hedge a minimum of  $50.0\%$  of TNB's known foreign currency exposure up to 12 months period. The Group and the Company use forward exchange contracts and maintain foreign currency floats to hedge its foreign currency risk.

Exposure to foreign currency risk

The currency exposure of financial assets and financial liabilities of the Group and of the Company at the end of the financial year, expressed in MYR (if not defined, Malaysian Ringgit) currency units, are as follows:

<table><tr><td></td><td>USD RM&#x27;million</td><td>JPY RM&#x27;million</td><td>GBP RM&#x27;million</td><td>EUR RM&#x27;million</td><td>Others RM&#x27;million</td></tr><tr><td>2024</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Group</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Financial assets</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Financial assets at FVOCI</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0.4</td></tr><tr><td>Receivables</td><td>5.9</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>4.5</td></tr><tr><td>Deposits, bank and cash balances</td><td>1,752.9</td><td>0</td><td>1,027.9</td><td>1.0</td><td>1.0</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>1,758.8</td><td>0</td><td>1,027.9</td><td>1.0</td><td>5.9</td></tr><tr><td>Financial liabilities</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Payables</td><td>11.9</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>22.0</td><td>7.8</td></tr><tr><td>Borrowings</td><td>8,618.4</td><td>1,375.1</td><td>0</td><td>462.4</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>8,630.3</td><td>1,375.1</td><td>0</td><td>484.4</td><td>7.8</td></tr></table>

Currency risk sensitivity analysis

A  $10.0\%$  strengthening of the foreign currencies against RM at the end of the financial year would have decreased post-tax profit or loss by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remained constant and ignores any impact of forecasted sales and purchases.

A  $10.0\%$  weakening of the foreign currencies against RM at the end of the financial year would have had equal but opposite effect on the above currencies to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remained constant.

Foreign currency risk for the Group and the Company which have a functional currency other than USD, JPY, EUR and GBP are not material and hence, sensitivity analysis is not presented.

(ii) Interest rate risk

The Group's and the Company's investments in fixed rate debt security and its fixed rate borrowings are not exposed to a significant risk of change in their fair values due to changes in interest rates. The Group's and the Company's variable rate borrowings are exposed to a risk of change in cash flows due to changes in interest rates. Investment in equity security and short term receivables and payables are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk.

Exposure to interest rate risk

The interest rate profile of the Group's and of the Company's significant interest-bearing financial instruments, based on carrying amounts as at the end of the financial year were:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">Group</td><td colspan="2">Company</td></tr><tr><td>2024

The financial assets are not sensitive to interest rate changes.

A  $5.0\%$  change in the interest rates of the financial liabilities with floating interest rates at the end of the financial year would have affected the Group's and the Company's profit or loss and equity by RM1.0 million (2023: RM0.7 million). This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates remained constant.

(iii) Other price risk

Other price risk arises from the Group's and the Company's investments in equity security, debt security and unit trust funds.

Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk

The Group and the Company are exposed to price risk because the investments held are classified on the statement of financial position as FVOCI and FVTPL. The Group and the Company mainly invest in money market placement and unit trust funds, primarily in short term deposits as underlying instruments with minimal price risk.

Fair value of financial instruments

The carrying amounts of deposits, bank and cash balances, short term receivables and payables, short term borrowings, short term amount due from/(to) subsidiaries and short term derivative financial instruments approximate their fair values and are equivalent to nominal values due to the relatively short term nature of these financial instruments.

# 45 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)

(b) Financial risk management (continued)

Fair value of financial instruments (continued)

(i) Policy on transfer between levels

The fair value of an asset to be transferred between levels is determined as of the date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.

There were no transfers between levels during the financial year.

(ii) Level 1 fair value

Level 1 fair value is derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.

(iii) Level 2 fair value

Level 2 fair value is estimated using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the financial assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly.

Derivative financial instruments

The fair value is estimated by the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract.

Non-derivative financial instruments

Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purpose, is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the end of the reporting period.

(iv) Level 3 fair value

Level 3 fair values for the financial assets and liabilities are estimated using unobservable inputs.

(v) Interest rates used to determine fair value

The interest rates used to discount estimated cash flows, when applicable, ranging between  $0.8\%$  to  $8.0\%$  (2023:  $0.8\%$  to  $8.0\%$ ).

Although the Group and the Company believe that their estimates of fair value are appropriate, the use of different methodologies or assumptions could lead to different measurements of fair value.

The favourable and unfavourable effects of using reasonably possible alternative assumptions have been calculated by recalibrating the model values using expected cash flows and risk-adjusted discount rates based on the probability weighted average of the Group's and of the Company's ranges of possible outcomes.

# 46 CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT

The Group's and the Company's main objective of capital management is to safeguard the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders. The Group and the Company will also strive to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

For the purpose of sustaining or changing the capital structure, the Group and the Company may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, issue new shares or return capital to shareholders.

In order to be consistent with industry norms, the Group and the Company monitor its capital structure on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as total borrowings divided by capital employed. Total borrowings include non-current borrowings and current borrowings as shown in the consolidated statement of financial position. Capital employed is the summation of total equity and total borrowings.

The gearing ratios are as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">Group</td><td colspan="2">Company</td></tr><tr><td>2024

# (ii) Dullarbtons and Elipsgeen

VRE3, a newly incorporated wholly owned subsidiary of TNBI, completed its acquisition of Dullarbtons and Elipsgeen for a purchase consideration of EUR97.5 million in cash. Refer to Note 48 for the principal activities of these companies.

The Group's profit after tax for the financial year ended 31 December 2023 would have been estimated at RM2,641.5 million if Dullarbtons and Elipsgeen have been consolidated from the beginning of the financial year. From the acquisition date up to 31 December 2023, Dullarbtons and Elipsgeen contributed a loss after tax of RM4.3 million. The transaction costs incurred for this acquisition were RM8.0 million.

The net identifiable assets and goodwill disclosed in the consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended 31 December 2023 were based on provisional figures which were expected to be finalised within 12 months from the acquisition date.

After PPA finalisation, during the financial year, the goodwill amount is revised to RM182.3 million (EUR36.0 million), an increase of RM23.6 million from the provisional goodwill of RM158.7 million (EUR31.3 million). The change in goodwill is mainly due to the recognition of derivative financial liabilities on power purchase agreements in accordance with the requirements of MFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' and adjustment to the fair value of PPE. The cash consideration paid has also increased by RM1.6 million during the financial year due to finalisation of working capital adjustment.

# Independent Auditors' Report

To The Members of Tenaga Nasional Berhad (Incorporated in Malaysia) Registration No. 199001009294 (200866-W)

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# Our opinion

In our opinion, the financial statements of Tenaga Nasional Berhad (the Company) and its subsidiaries (the Group) give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and of the Company as at 31 December 2024, and of their financial performance and their cash flows for the financial year then ended in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.

# What we have audited

We have audited the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, which comprise the statements of financial position as at 31 December 2024 of the Group and of the Company, and the statements of profit or loss, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows of the Group and of the Company for the financial year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of material accounting policies, as set out on pages 234 to 389.

# Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the "Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements" section of our report.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

# Independence and other ethical responsibilities

We are independent of the Group and of the Company in accordance with the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, Conduct and Practice) of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants (By-Laws) and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) (IESBA Code), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the By-Laws and the IESBA Code.

# Our audit approach

As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company. In particular, we considered where the Directors made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters, consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.

We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and of the Company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group and the Company operate.

# Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Information other than the financial statements and auditors' report thereon

The Directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Directors' Report and the Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control, which we obtained prior to the date of this auditors' report, and other sections of TNB Integrated Annual Report 2024, which is expected to be made available to us after that date. Other information does not include the financial statements of the Group and of the Company and our auditors' report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditors' report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements

The Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company that give a true and fair view in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

# Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

(a) Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.  
(b) Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's and of the Company's internal control.  
(c) Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors.  
(d) Conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's or on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.  
(e) Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.  
(f) Plan and perform the group audit to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business units within the Group as a basis for forming an opinion on the Group financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and review of the audit work performed for purposes of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To The Members of Tenaga Nasional Berhad (Incorporated in Malaysia) Registration No. 199001009294 (200866-W)

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

We communicate with the Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

From the matters communicated with the Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

In accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia, we report that the subsidiaries of which we have not acted as auditors, are disclosed in Note 48 to the financial statements.

# OTHER MATTERS

This report is made solely to the members of the Company, as a body, in accordance with Section 266 of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility to any other person for the content of this report.

# NOTICE OF THE  $35^{\text{TH}}$  ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING

# EXPLANATORY NOTES ON ORDINARY BUSINESSES:

(a) Agenda No. 1 is meant for discussion only as the provision of Section 340(1)(a) of the Act does not require shareholders' approval for the Audited Financial Statements. As such, it is not put forward for voting.  
(b) Ordinary Resolutions 1 to 5 - Proposed Re-election of Directors in accordance with Clauses 64(1) and 63(2) of the Company's Constitution

Clause 64(1) of the Company's Constitution provides among others, that one-third (1/3) of the Directors at the time being of whom have been longest in office shall retire by rotation at the AGM of the Company and shall be eligible for re-election.

Clause 63(2) of the Company's Constitution provides among others, that the Directors shall have power at any time and from time to time to appoint any other person to be a Director of the Company either to fill a casual vacancy or as an addition to the existing Directors. Any Director so appointed shall hold office only until the next following AGM of the Company and shall then be eligible for re-election.

The Board with the assistance of the Board Nomination and Remuneration Committee (BNRC) conducted an independence assessment of all Independent Directors including Juniwati Rahmat Hussin, Gopala Krishnan K.Sundaram, Dato' Merina binti Abu Tahir and Alan Hamzah Sendut and are satisfied that they have complied with the independence criteria as required by the Main Market Listing Requirements of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad (MMLR) and continued to bring independent and objective judgment to the Board deliberations.

The BNRC and Board also considered the Board Effectiveness Assessment including the Self and Peer Assessment results of Rohaya binti Mohammad Yusof, Juniwati Rahmat Hussin, Gopala Krishnan K.Sundaram and Dato' Merina binti Abu Tahir and agreed that they have met the Board's expectation in terms of experience, expertise, integrity, competency, commitment and individual contribution by continuously performing their duties diligently as Company Directors.

The retiring Directors who are standing for re-election have fulfilled the fit and proper assessment that comprises character & integrity, experience & competence and time & commitment.

The Board on 28 November 2024 had approved the appointment of Alan Hamzah Sendut as Independent Non-Executive Director with effect from 2 December 2024.

The BNRC and Board hereby recommend for the re-election of each Director who is retiring at the  $35^{\text{th}}$  AGM.

Any Director referred to in Ordinary Resolutions 1 to 5, who is a shareholder of the Company will abstain from voting on the resolution in respect of his/her re-election at the  $35^{\text{th}}$  AGM.

(c) Ordinary Resolutions 6 to 17 - Non-Executive Directors' Remuneration

Section 230(1) of the Act stipulates among others that the fees and any benefits payable to the Directors of a listed company and its subsidiaries shall be approved at a general meeting. As agreed by the Board, the shareholders' approval shall be sought at the  $35^{\text{th}}$  AGM pertaining to the Non-Executive Directors' remuneration of the Company and TNB Subsidiaries Category II and III through separate resolutions as follows:

(i) Ordinary Resolutions 6 to 15 on the payment of Non-Executive Directors' fees for the Non-Executive Chairman and each Non-Executive Director separately from the  $35^{\text{th}}$  AGM until the next AGM of the Company.  
(ii) Ordinary Resolution 16 on the payment of benefits payable (excluding Non-Executive Directors' fees) to the Non-Executive Directors from the  $35^{\text{th}}$  AGM until the next AGM of the Company.  
(iii) Ordinary Resolution 17 on the payment of Non-Executive Director's fee and benefits for Alan Hamzah Sendut, from the date of his appointment on 2 December 2024 until the  $35^{\text{th}}$  AGM of the Company.

The last review of the Non-Executive Directors' remuneration/benefits payable was made in 2013. The Board in 2023 had engaged an independent expert to conduct a holistic and independent review of the Non-Executive Directors' Remuneration with the view to determine its market competitiveness and alignment with the latest regulations/corporate governance guidelines in Malaysia.

Based on the findings, the Board recommended for the Director's fee of Non-Executive Chairman to be revised from RM30,000.00 per month to RM32,000.00 per month considering the importance of his roles and the responsibilities he carries for the operation and leadership of the Board in ensuring its effectiveness and in strengthening TNB's relationship with the stakeholders/shareholders. With that, the Non-Executive Chairman's fee competitiveness will sit between P25 and P50 mark of the peer group in the market.

The Non-Executive Directors' Remuneration is structured to reflect the complexity, responsibility and accountability of the Board's role in complying with increasing regulatory demands, to be competitive and to retain the required talent as well as recognising their skills that are highly sought after and to ensure the remuneration reflects the time and effort dedicated by the Chair and Directors as part of their roles on the Board and Board Committees.

In determining the estimated total amount of benefits payable, the Board had considered various factors including the meeting allowances based on the respective Committees in terms of responsibilities/accountabilities, the number of scheduled and special meetings for the Board, Board Committees and boards of subsidiaries along with the number of Non-Executive Directors involved.

The proposed Ordinary Resolutions 6 to 15 and Ordinary Resolution 16 for the payment of Directors' fees and benefits payable to the Non-Executive Directors of the Company from the  $35^{\text{th}}$  AGM until the conclusion of the next AGM are tabled herewith in line with the provision of the Act and Guidance 7.2 of the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance 2021 to ensure full disclosure.

Payment of Non-Executive Directors' benefits will be made by the Company and its subsidiaries on a monthly basis and/or as and when incurred, provided that the proposed Ordinary Resolution 16 be passed at the  $35^{\text{th}}$  AGM. The Board is of the view that it is fair and justifiable for the payment of benefits to the Non-Executive Directors be made as and when incurred, after the Non-Executive Directors have discharged their responsibilities and rendered their services to the Company.

For the proposed Ordinary Resolution 17, Alan Hamzah Sendut, an Independent Non-Executive Director was appointed with effect from 2 December 2024 which is after the  $34^{\text{th}}$  AGM. Therefore, the approval of the payment of director's fees and benefits since his appointment until the  $35^{\text{th}}$  AGM will be sought at this AGM.

# (d) Ordinary Resolution 18 - Re-appointment of Auditors

Based on the External Auditors Assessment Result for the Financial Year under review, the Board and Board Audit Committee are satisfied with the quality of service, adequacy of resources provided, communication, independence, objectivity and professionalism demonstrated by the External Auditors in carrying out their duties. Being satisfied with the External Auditors' performance, the Board recommends their re-appointment for shareholders' approval at the  $35^{\text{th}}$  AGM.
