# About this report

This Annual Report combines CSL's financial and non-financial performance in one comprehensive account, linking our sustainability and strategic priorities to our business results.

CSL conducts a detailed sustainability materiality assessment every two years, with our most recent assessment undertaken in early 2022. The prioritised results of our assessment are available within this report and on CSL.com. In addition, this year, we compared CSL's materiality assessment with that of Vifor Pharma, and while there were minor variations, an enterprise-wide assessment will be conducted in financial year 2024. In addition to an independent audit of our consolidated financial accounts, limited assurance on a selection of corporate responsibility (CR) metrics has been provided by Ernst & Young, and an assurance statement for non-financial indicators can be found on page 81. Further, more detailed Group and sustainability information, including CSL's materiality assessment, can be found on CSL.com (Sustainability).

# Chair Message

Dear Fellow Shareholders,

I am pleased to share our results and operating review for the 2022/23 financial year. In the following pages you will see that CSL has once again performed strongly, with many operational highlights around the world.

# A Purpose-Driven Company

To begin, I'd like to share my view on why our organisation exists. Your Board is grateful to have many long-term shareholders who have followed our story for decades. Our businesses, and certainly the science that underpins them, can be quite complex. Our purpose though is simple.

The people and science of CSL save lives. We develop and deliver innovative medicines that help people with serious and life-threatening conditions live full lives, and protect the health of communities around the world. The great thing about our company is that in fulfilling this purpose, we create value for a variety of stakeholders.

First and above all else, our most important task is to contribute to a healthier and more productive society. We do this by saving lives and protecting public health.

Our second aim is financial growth – delivering consistent, profitable growth for our investors. It is our sustainable, financial growth that provides the fuel for more innovation and research. If done successfully, it is a great continuous loop: quality research leads to more research, which has the potential to create innovate therapies that benefits society. CSL has been able to demonstrate this over many years.

Our third objective is about creating social and economic opportunities and enabling people to benefit as we grow as an organisation, be it employees, suppliers, plasma donors or research partners.

Being able to create value in these ways is a great privilege, but also a responsibility. Good governance is an essential part of this responsibility.

# Leadership Transition

The role of the Board is to guide our company in navigating the complexities of the world to create value over the long run. One aspect of this is talent: monitoring the composition of the Board and management teams so that we have the right skills to lead our company.

During the year, Paul Perreault retired from his role of Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Managing Director. The Board and I wish to acknowledge the remarkable leadership of Paul as CEO for 10 years. With Paul at the helm, CSL delivered sustainable growth and innovation with a patient-focused culture.

Following a thorough process conducted by the Board, Dr Paul McKenzie was appointed as CEO and Managing Director of CSL from 6 March 2023. Dr McKenzie's detailed work history can be found later in this report; he brings more than 30 years of leadership experience in the global biotechnology industry to CSL. He is a patient-focused leader with a demonstrated track record of leading complex organisations and delivering outstanding business results. This includes his time at CSL as the Chief Operating Officer, where he has been accountable for optimising CSL's operations as well as growing the CSL Seqirus, CSL Behring and CSL Vifor businesses.

Despite there being no changes to CSL's non-executive Board members this year, the composition of the Board is an ever-present priority. We aim to have the right skills and expertise to navigate our industry and the broader macro environment. We believe we have a strong and complementary dynamic that will continue our long record of exceptional governance.

Bruce Brook will retire as a Director at this year's Annual General Meeting. I'd like to thank Bruce for his service over the last 12 years. His guidance has been of immense value to the Board and our shareholders. Alison Watkins will become Chair of the Audit and Risk Management Committee following Bruce's retirement.

# Our Evolving Footprint

As we grow and our operations become more complex, your Board continues to prioritise meeting our employees and spending time at our facilities around the world.

This year we visited our European operations, including our manufacturing plants and research and development facilities in Bern (Switzerland), St Gallen (Switzerland) and Marburg (Germany).

We also spent a very productive week with our Australian teams and inspected our Australian facilities. Underpinned by the confidence we have in the long-term prospects for our company, we have invested a significant amount of capital in our Australian operations over the past few years. This includes the recently completed Plasma Fractionation Facility in Broadmeadows, and our new US\(530-million state-of-the-art cell-based vaccine manufacturing facility in Tullamarine, which will be operational in 2026. These investments will enhance our capacity to meet patient needs into the future.

We also officially moved into our new Global Headquarters and Centre for R&D in Melbourne in March. Located in the heart of the city's biomedical precinct, the building represents the progress CSL has made during its journey from a small, local company to the global biotech leader we are today. This is a significant milestone not just for CSL, but for Australia, and I look forward to the scientific and commercial developments that will no doubt come from collaboration in the precinct.

# Environment and Sustainability

In August last year, we took the next step in our sustainability strategy by announcing CSL Group carbon emission reduction targets for the first time. The specific targets build on our previous work by serving as a tangible, transparent roadmap to decarbonising CSL's operations by reducing the company's direct and indirect emissions footprint. You can read more in the Environment section of this report, but I am pleased to see the progress we've already made.

In addition to reducing carbon emissions, CSL is prioritising integrating environmental considerations into key business decisions; minimising end-to-end production of waste through removal, reduction and recycling; and reducing waste in our supply chain. This year, our teams will also be focusing on advancing the social pillar of our sustainability strategy. We will continue to be transparent with our stakeholders, and will share more information as our efforts progress.

# A Bright Future

I can assure you that CSL will remain true to the formula that has largely driven our success to date. There is so much potential to make a difference to people's lives – so many problems to solve and so much science to translate. CSL has been very deliberate about targeting areas where we know we can develop a competitive advantage. This will not change; we will remain dedicated to our strategy.

But this should not be seen as a conflict with our growth aspirations. The two goals are very much complementary: our strategy is built for sustained, long-term growth.

Our confidence about this is built around a few key factors. Firstly, the underlying demand for our products will remain robust. It is an unfortunate reality that patients will continue to be diagnosed with rare and serious diseases. We have a high-quality range of safe and effective products that help these patients, and will continue to do so well into the future.

Secondly, our research and development (R&D) pipeline is constantly maintained and evaluated. The nature of our business means we have to think decades ahead. We have certainly done this, and a number of key prospective treatments are nearing the commercialisation phase. Importantly, we also have key early-stage options to take their place.

And finally, as we grow we will benefit from the capital we have reinvested back into the business. Our global network is built for efficient, reliable supply that we aim to deliver with some of the best margins in the sector. We will continue to drive value across the organisation.

The Board and I believe that CSL is in a strong position and we look forward to sharing our progress with shareholders.

# CEO Message

Dear Shareholders,

I am honoured to be writing to you as Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of CSL, a role in which I began in March 2023.

Since joining CSL as Chief Operating Officer, I have been accountable for optimising CSL's operations as well as growing the CSL Seqirus, CSL Behring and CSL Vifor businesses. Along with the current management team, I have been intimately involved in developing CSL's 2030 Strategy – from development to execution. My predecessor Paul Perreault was an exceptional leader and oversaw a decade of great success for CSL. I have inherited a highly motivated, values-based team with a relentless focus on continuing our purpose-driven journey of sustainable and profitable growth.

# Building on Success

At CSL, given the essential nature of our work, the iconic history of our company, and the world-class quality of our team, I am truly humbled and, at the same time, extremely excited to be your CEO.

For more than a century, we have been driven by our promise to patients. This has distinguished CSL, defining our strong position as one of the world's leading biotech companies. Our purpose, values, and promise remain steadfast and even more relevant in today's complex, and evolving world.

The formula that has enabled CSL to deliver value for a variety of stakeholders throughout our history is proven. On page 23 you can read about 2030 Strategy. CSL will continue to follow this strategy under my leadership, but as I look forward over the medium term, I see the following five priorities:

1. Leverage our scale and execute on our commercial portfolios and innovation agendas.  
2. Evolve and differentiate our vaccine platform.  
3. Unlock the value and growth within CSL Vifor.  
4.Drive further improvement in CSL Behring margins.  
5. Be an employer of choice and a strategic partner of choice.

# Playing to Our Strengths

I believe CSL is uniquely equipped to contribute in the next era of innovation and to make a lasting impact on communities around the world. CSL's many strengths position us well for the future, as shown in the following examples.

We deliver innovative life-saving medicines in over 100 countries.  
- Every day, more than 342 plasma collection centres enhance donor experiences and provide our critical raw material to save lives.  
- Our R&D pipeline has never been more robust or more promising.  
- Productivity and efficiency remain hallmarks and competitive advantages for CSL. Our network strategy is robust, and we are bringing on new capacity and capabilities around the globe.

The Board of Directors and management team are aligned in our focus. We understand our strengths and are guided by our 2030 Strategy, which defines the guardrails for accelerating sustainable and profitable growth.

We unashamedly operate with long-term success in mind. This involves making smart, bold choices today that seek to benefit people and patients well into the future. This year, several important capital investments were completed. As I visited our sites around the world, I was impressed to see these, and the teams responsible for their success, firsthand.

In August, we successfully closed the acquisition of CSL Vifor. The integration into the CSL group is well advanced and I want to recognise all the hard work that has gone into this so far. While we have only owned CSL Vifor for a short time we're excited by the opportunity to grow the iron franchise, to drive new indications, expand into new geographies and improve access.

In Broadmeadows, Victoria, we opened our US\(600-million Plasma Fractionation Facility. This is the largest of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere, and allows us to process up to 9.2 million plasma equivalent litres per annum, a nine-fold increase on the previous capacity. In March, we opened its sister facility in Marburg, Germany. Featuring identical equipment and processes, we aim to leverage best practice to further improve the efficiency of our network strategy.

Also in Marburg, after three years of construction, we opened our new US\(160-million R&D site. Covering around 40,000 square metres, the M600 centre provides space for up to 500 R&D employees, making it CSL's largest R&D hub worldwide and combining all disciplines under one roof. In March, we opened the company's new state-of-the-art vaccine R&D centre near Boston, Massachusetts, United States. At this site, we will aim to accelerate the development of next-generation mRNA technology for vaccines and collaborate with local partners within this world class research ecosystem.

# Innovation Agenda

These new facilities are intended to underpin the next phase of innovation for CSL. But this doesn't happen without our people who spend their days investigating new ways to serve patients and public health. R&D, coupled with relentless and disruptive innovation across all parts of the business, has been vital to our success. CSL will continue to build a full and innovative pipeline that has the potential to make a meaningful difference to the lives of patients and to public health.

A key part of CSL's innovation agenda is forming strategic partnerships with others. This includes partnering with Arcturus Therapeutics to develop and deliver next-generation mRNA vaccines, and with UniQure on gene therapy.

At times, this means disrupting ourselves. In 2016, we launched IDELVION® a recombinant factor IX albumin fusion protein, and it quickly became the standard of care for thousands of patients suffering from haemophilia B.

However, we did not stop innovating. Haemophilia B is caused by a gene mutation, so we partnered with UniQure to commercialise the world's first gene therapy for adults with haemophilia B, called HEMGENIX®. This year we received approval for HEMGENIX® in the United States, Europe and the UK. While there may be some patients who decide to switch from IDELVION® to HEMGENIX®, we recognise that we need to disrupt ourselves so we can make more breakthrough therapies available to those who can benefit.

We must take innovation of all shapes and sizes and move it to commercial reality. This is a strategic imperative for us, and can generate speed, efficiency and value.

# Outlook

I remain optimistic about the prospects of CSL. CSL is well placed in markets where we operate. We have a strong financial base, and we have the right leaders to guide our next phase of growth. I can assure you that our people are committed to our purpose and the great vision we share for our company.

# Immunology

CSL's world leading immunoglobulin franchise is the cornerstone of the immunology therapeutic area and is focused on developing and delivering trusted products and technologies to serve patients with a range of serious immunologic and neurologic diseases, including primary and secondary immunodeficiencies (PID/ SID), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and hereditary angioedema (HAE). Key CSL Behring products on the market include PRIVIGEN®, HIZENTRA®, BERINERT®, HAEGARDA® and a range of hyperimmunes.

Building on CSL's long history of providing patients with immunoglobulin products, it continues to optimise the patient experience by developing more convenient and flexible ways to dose and administer existing immunoglobulin products. Key recombinant assets are also progressing in early development to treat underserved immune-mediated diseases. CSL continues to build on its strong 40-year legacy in HAE, working to expand on current medicines to provide optimal treatments for the full range of HAE patients. Garadacimab, CSL's first-in-class monoclonal antibody targeting activated Factor XII (FXIIa), is being developed as a prospective long-term prophylactic treatment for patients with HAE.

# Haematology

CSL remains focused on easing the burden of disease and improving the lives of patients with rare bleeding disorders. Major advances have been made in haemophilia A and B in recent years with the launch of novel recombinant coagulation factor medicines and through the acquisition of exclusive global licence rights to commercialise HEMGENIX® (etranacogene bezaparvovec), an AAV5 (adeno-associated virus) gene therapy for the treatment of haemophilia B, which has been approved in the United States, Europe and the UK. Other key CSL Behring products on the market include IDELVION®, AFSTYLA®, HUMATE P®/HAEMATE®, BERIPLEX®/KCENTRA®, RIASTAP®/HEMOCOMPLETTAN®, VONCENTO®/BIOSTATE® and albumin.

Additionally, exciting R&D efforts are underway to explore new indications in benign haematology as well as novel therapeutics in haemostasis and thrombosis. This includes initiating an important global Phase III study to evaluate the early administration of KCENTRA® (4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate) on survival in trauma patients suffering life-threatening bleeding, and a Phase II study under a licensing agreement with Translational Sciences using CSL301 (α2 anti-plasmin), a first-in-class, chimeric monoclonal antibody as thrombolytic treatment in adults with acute sub-massive pulmonary embolism.

# Respiratory

Respiratory diseases impose an enormous burden on patients and society and are a leading cause of death and disability worldwide.

In addition to CSL's existing product, ZEMAIRA®/RESPREEZA® for patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, CSL is investigating potential new clinical treatments for respiratory diseases using novel recombinant monoclonal antibodies and plasma-derived therapies to address this need. Trabikibart, an anti-beta common monoclonal antibody, is being investigated for the treatment of severe uncontrolled asthma and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a severe debilitating disease, a clinical development program has started with garadacimab, the first of CSL's compounds being explored in this disease area. CSL787, a plasma-derived, inhaled immunoglobulin is being investigated for patients with bronchiectasis.

# Cardiovascular and metabolic

CSL is focused on improving and extending the lives of patients with cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Many patients with cardiovascular disease also have some degree of renal impairment and CSL recognises the critical need to address the unique challenges faced by this patient population.

CSL112, apolipoprotein A-I (human), is being developed to reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events during the 90-day high-risk period following a heart attack, the period when the majority of first-year recurrent cardiovascular events occur. If successful, CSL112 will be the first therapy to demonstrate cardiovascular risk reduction through the novel apoA-I mechanism and has the potential to transform how acute myocardial infarction patients at high risk of recurrent cardiovascular events are treated. In addition, clazakizumab, first-in-class anti-interleukin-6 (anti-IL-6) monoclonal antibody is being developed for the reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in End Stage Kidney Disease (ESKD) dialysis patients.

![](images/1b6d352343519ced5e653547878826df94bb90d6af4966aa24ca11283328a030.jpg)

# Transplant

While advances in transplantation techniques and therapies have markedly improved short-term patient survival, transplant rejection remains one of the greatest limitations to long-term graft and patient survival for both solid organ and haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. CSL is focused on developing therapies to address transplant rejection and while current solid organ focus lies in kidney transplants, this vision encompasses a broader scope to help treat patients undergoing various solid organ transplantations.

In kidney transplant recipients, antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) is a leading cause of allograft loss, and there is significant unmet need for effective treatments. Clazakizumab, our anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody, is currently being investigated in a Phase III clinical trial (IMAGINE) for the potential treatment of chronic active antibody-mediated rejection. In haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) is a life-threatening type of rejection where the donor cells attack the recipient; it is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity following transplant. There is a significant unmet need for more effective, less toxic therapies for GvHD. We are investigating alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT, ZEMAIRA®) for the prevention and treatment of acute GvHD in two Phase III studies.

# CSL Seqirus

CSL Seqirus' broad range of influenza vaccines addresses the needs of different populations around the world. In Australia and New Zealand, CSL Seqirus is also a leading provider of in-licensed vaccines and specialty pharmaceuticals. It is also the world's only supplier of a unique range of products of national significance for the Australian Government, including Q fever vaccine and antivenoms for venomous creatures in Australia and other Pacific countries.

# CSL Vifor

Iron deficiency and nephrological disorders pose significant unmet medical needs globally. The CSL Vifor portfolio provides a strong and rapidly growing presence in nephrology, particularly in patients requiring dialysis. CSL Vifor is committed to launching the next generation of therapies as it endeavours to truly address the full spectrum of kidney disease, with a focus on dialysis and rare disease. This is supported by a founding heritage and expertise in iron deficiency therapy, helping to support a broad range of patients.

![](images/777d79256cc1ab8f78fd79e17ef80b3f5d74120e2b447703767479a308d7c5fa.jpg)

The acquisition of Vifor Pharma in August 2022 has enhanced CSL's product portfolio, complementing existing products and offering a wider range of treatments for conditions such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), anaemia and renal disorders. Key CSL Vifor products on the market include TAVNEOS®, KORSUVA®/ KAPRUVIA®, MIRCERA®, RETACRIT®, VELTASSA®, RAYALDEE®, VELPHORO® and our iron products FERINJECT®/INJECTAFER®, VENOFER® and MALTOFER®.

With the combination of resources, research capabilities, scientific insights and CSL's patient-centred approach, CSL can develop innovative therapies, accelerate the development of novel treatments, improve patient outcomes, and contribute to advancements in these specialised fields. This expanded portfolio positions CSL to address a wider range of unmet needs in patients with iron and nephrological disorders and should support a more comprehensive range of options for patients with improved access to effective treatments leading to better disease management, enhanced quality of life and improved patient care overall.

In June, we initiated further activities to progress the integration of the CSL Vifor R&D teams and programs into the overall CSL R&D organisation and processes. This includes incorporating them into our Therapeutic Areas and Project Operating Model, as well as aligning them with our R&D governance framework. More information about the CSL Vifor R&D integration will be communicated at our annual R&D update to the market.

# New products to market

CSL continues to broaden the geography and use of its medicines for rare and specialty diseases across the globe within the immunology and haematology therapeutic areas as well as in nephrology and iron deficiencies, and the use of vaccines to help prevent infectious disease and protect public health.

Within the immunology portfolio, regulatory indication expansion and new registrations are primarily focused on subcutaneous immunoglobulin, HIZENTRA®, and our human Cl-esterase inhibitor, BERINERT®, each with four new registrations including, importantly, BERINERT® S.C. Injection 2000 in Japan for the treatment of HAE. The new HIZENTRA® registrations supported indications for primary immunodeficiency (PID), a chronic disorder in which part of the body's immune system is missing or malfunctioning, and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), a chronically progressive, rare autoimmune disorder that affects the peripheral nerves and may cause permanent nerve damage. With CIDP, the myelin sheath, or the protective covering of the nerves, is damaged, which may result in numbness or tingling, muscle weakness, fatigue and other symptoms, which worsen over time. Additionally, indication expansion was approved for HIZENTRA® for secondary immunodeficiency (SID) in two countries. SID is similar to primary immunodeficiency (PID); however, SID occurs when the immune system is compromised as a result of disease or due to an environmental factor (e.g., chemotherapy, disease complication).

In CSL's haematology therapeutic area, there is continued focus on the expansion of the current portfolio as well as the first registrations of HEMGENIX®, etranacogenedezaparvovec, a one-time gene therapy for the treatment of adults with haemophilia B. Five new registrations were achieved for

our recombinant factor VIII product, AFSTYLA®, which is used to control and prevent bleeding episodes in people with haemophilia A. Four new registrations were achieved for our human coagulation factor VIII/VWF, HAEMATE® and seven for human albumin. One new registration was achieved for BERIPLEX®, our human prothrombin complex concentrate and one for BERIPLAST® P, our combined human fibrinogen, factor XIII and bovine aprotinin product. Four new registrations were achieved for HAEMOCOMPLETTAN® P, our human fibrinogen concentrate. Three new registrations and expansions were achieved for IDELVION®, our recombinant factor IX albumin fusion protein (rFIX-FP) which is used to control and prevent bleeding episodes in people with haemophilia B.

For our CSL Seqirus business, FLUAD® QUADRIVALENT, our adjuvanted influenza vaccine, was authorised for persons 65 years and older in Taiwan, Brazil and South Korea.

For CSL Vifor, there were seven new registrations for KORSUVA® (difelikefalin), for the treatment of moderate-to-severe pruritus associated with chronic kidney disease in adult patients on haemodialysis. Four new registrations were achieved for TAVNEOS® (avacampan) to treat adults with severe active anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis. For VELPHORO®, there were two new registrations for the control of serum phosphorus levels in adults with chronic kidney disease on haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. There was one new registration for VELTASSA® (patiromer sorbitex calcium) for the treatment of high blood potassium. There was one new registration, and two label expansions for FERINJECT® (ferric carboxymaltose) and one indication expansion for INJECTAFTER®, ferric carboxymaltose injection, for the treatment of iron deficiency in patients with heart failure.

# Our operating review

# CSL Behring

Total revenue was US$9,290 million, up 12% when compared to the prior comparable period.

Immunoglobulin (Ig) product sales of US$4,675 million, increased 21% with strong growth recorded across all geographies as global supply recovered strongly.

PRIVIGEN® (Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human),  $10\%$  Liquid) sales delivered strong growth of  $29\%$  as demand continues to recover from the pandemic with patient diagnosis and new patient starts steadily increasing.

HIZENTRA® (Immune Globulin Subcutaneous (Human), 20% Liquid) sales were up  $12\%$  as patient diagnosis rates continue to improve and new patients emerge.

Underlying demand for Ig continues to be strong due to significant patient needs in core indications – namely Primary Immune Deficiency, Secondary Immune Deficiency and Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP).

Albumin sales of US$1,109 million, were up 11%. Sales in China were up strongly as COVID restrictions eased. Solid growth was also recorded in the United States and Europe as supply improved.

Haemophilia product sales of US$1,193 million increased 8%.

IDELVION®, CSL Behring's novel long-acting recombinant factor IX product, achieved strong growth of  $13\%$  as patient interactions with health care providers increased post COVID.

HEMGENIX®, the first and only gene therapy for haemophilia B was successfully launched in the United States.

The haemophilia A market continued to be competitive resulting in a modest increase in sales for AFSTYLA®, a novel recombinant factor VIII product, and a decline in sales for plasma-derived products.

Specialty product sales of US\(1,831 million, up \(6 \%\)led predominately by demand for KCENTRA® and ZEMAIRA®.

KCENTRA® (4 factor prothrombin complex concentrate) recorded sales growth of  $10\%$ , as social mobility increased post COVID.

ZEMAIRA® Alpha-Proteinase Inhibitor (Human) sales were up  $24\%$  as supply returned.

# Plasma Collections

Plasma collections were robust with plasma volumes up  $31\%$  and now at record levels.

Improved social mobility post COVID, targeted marketing campaigns and enhanced digital initiatives to attract donors all contributed to this unprecedented growth.

The cost of collecting plasma, which includes donor compensation and labour, declined  $\sim 14\%$  over the previous year end and  $\sim 17\%$  down from the peak in March 2022.

The significant increase in plasma supply underpins the company's ability to manufacture plasma products and enables CSL to meet the underlying patient demand for core plasma products.

# CSLSeqirus

Total revenue of US\(2,031 million, was up \(9 \%\)driven by growth in seasonal influenza vaccines, in particular FLUCELVAX® which increased \(30 \%\).

This growth was achieved against a backdrop of reduced rates of immunisation and highlights the strength of CSL Seqirus' strategy and its high value, differentiated product portfolio.

During the period:

- A licence agreement was signed with Arcturus Therapeutics for next-generation mRNA vaccine technology.  
- The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recognised FLUAD® as a preferentially recommended seasonal vaccine option for adults aged 65+ years.  
- Fill and finish capacity expansion now fully operational at Holly Springs and Liverpool.  
- Good progress was made on construction of the new cell-culture facility in Melbourne.

# CSL Vifor

Total revenue was US$1,989 million representing approximately 11 months contribution since the business was acquired on 9 August 2022. This amounts to approximately  $14\%$  growth[1,2] compared to the 11 months in FY22 before CSL ownership, reflecting solid growth across all key product areas.

The integration of CSL Vifor is well advanced and the cost synergies are well on track.

During the period INJECTAFER® (ferric carboxymaltose) was approved in the United States for the treatment of iron deficiency in adult patients with heart failure and FERINJECT® was launched in China in April 2023.

# Outlook

The strong growth in the immunoglobulins franchise is expected to continue following record plasma collections in FY23.

There are a number of initiatives underway to improve efficiencies which include a focus on optimising plasma collection costs, improving manufacturing yields and bringing new products to market, all of which will support the medium term recovery in CSL Behring's gross margin.

The launch of HEMGENIX®, in the United States last quarter will continue to deliver this paradigm-shifting treatment to the haemophilia B community in the United States and Europe in the year ahead. The R&D pipeline includes a number of late-stage programs nearing completion which will lead to more options for patients.

CSL Seqirus is anticipated to deliver another strong year driven by demand for its differentiated products. CSL Seqirus is progressing global registrations for its next-generation mRNA COVID vaccine.

For CSL Vifor, there is a focus on unlocking the value and growth within this newly acquired business. Supporting the medium-term outlook, research and development capabilities are being brought into the one R&D organisation. Nephrology and transplant therapeutic areas are being brought together and a number of patient blood management initiatives are underway that will cross between CSL Vifor and CSL Behring businesses.

# Expense Performance

Research and development (R&D) expenses were US $1,232^2$  million, up  $22\%$  when compared to the prior comparable period. The increase in expenses reflects the inclusion of CSL Vifor and progression of pipeline.

Selling and marketing expenses (S&M) were US\(1,454 million, up \(58\%^{1}\) when compared to the previous year. The inclusion of CSL Vifor for the first time, accounts for the increase in S&M expenses while other S&M expenses were held in line with the prior year.

General and administrative (G&A) expenses were US\(907² million, an increase of \(27 \text{‰}\) when compared to the prior comparable period. The increase in G&A expenses were related to the inclusion of CSL Vifor.

Depreciation, amortisation (D&A) expense and impairment was US$831 million, up 27% in comparison to the prior comparable period. The increase in D&A was largely due to the acquisition of CSL Vifor.

Net finance costs were US$406 million, up 165%. The increase in net finance costs was due to the debt associated with the acquisition of Vifor Pharma and higher interest rates.

# Financial position

Cashflow from operations was US\(2,601 million, down \(1\%\). Cash earnings growth was offset by growth of plasma collections.

Cash outflow from investing was US\(11,843 million, up significantly when compared to the prior comparable period driven by the acquisition of Vifor Pharma.

CSL's balance sheet remains in a strong position with net assets of US$17,826 million.

Current assets decreased by \(44\%\) to US\(9,259 million. The main driver was the cash payment relating to the acquisition of Vifor Pharma.

Non-current assets increased by \(127\%\) to US\(26,975 million in comparison to the previous year. The increase is largely due to the acquisition of Vifor Pharma and the intangible assets recognised by the acquisition.

Current liabilities decreased by \(35\%\) to US\(4,608 million. The decrease was mainly due to the reclassification of the 144A senior notes from current to non-current following the removal of a mandatory redemption feature on the close of the Vifor Pharma acquisition.

Non-current liabilities increased by  $107\%$  to  $\$ 13,800$ million compared to last financial year. The increase was due to the draw down in bank borrowings in connection with the acquisition of Vifor Pharma in addition to interest- bearing liabilities and borrowings assumed on the acquisition of Vifor Pharma.

CSL's Purpose, Values and Code of Responsible Business Practice

# Value we create

# A healthier more productive society

Protecting global health and the wellbeing of individuals, families, businesses and communities from life-threatening and/or complications resulting from influenza.

Saving and/or improving the quality of life of hundreds and thousands of people with rare and serious diseases.

# Sustainable financial growth

Delivering consistent, profitable and responsible growth for our investors, which fuels innovation and development.

# Social and economic opportunity

Enabling hundreds of thousands of people to benefit from opportunity created by growing along with us, including employees, suppliers, plasma donors and research partners.

# Our promise to patients

# CSL's 2030 Strategy

# CSL operates with a long-term mindset. Over time, we have served patients with life-saving therapies and effective vaccines. We have achieved consistent top-line growth and strong margins, which helps fuel further growth by allowing us to re-invest in our own businesses.

CSL is committed to the 2030 Strategy which includes Focus in core therapeutic areas, Innovation, Efficiency & Reliable Supply, Sustainable Growth, and Digital Transformation, with people at the centre of our strategy. We believe this is the best path, given our capabilities in an increasingly challenging and competitive world. The core elements of the 2030 Strategy are represented below.

![](images/b5b15d69a9e8f909340b6bf55db0570346a2c3d3878013487c6b7076b76acc0f.jpg)

CSL's long-term priorities are focused on delivering sustainable, profitable growth. This will allow CSL to continue to provide a reliable supply of our life-saving therapies and to fund innovation that improves the health of patients and the public. We are leaders in protein therapies, influenza vaccines and the treatment of iron deficiency. For CSL Behring, our immunoglobulin franchise is growing strongly, driven by record levels of plasma collections. CSL Seqirus is delivering strong sales growth driven by differentiated products and has future growth potential with next-generation mRNA vaccine technology that is in late-stage development with our partner Arcturus Therapeutics. CSL Vifor provides new opportunities to grow the iron deficiency treatment franchise and in nephrology where there is significant unmet need to drive new indications, expand into new geographies and improve access.

CSL provides life-saving products to patients in more than 40 countries and employs around 32,000 people globally. We have an extensive network of manufacturing sites across Australia, the United States, Europe and China. In addition, we look beyond our walls to partner with leading organisations across the value chain to support manufacturing, innovation, technology and other areas of our business.

# Delivering R&D

CSL remains committed to investing in targeted and disruptive research and development (R&D) innovation to better meet the needs of patients and public health. This commitment is evidenced by the continued investment in R&D, surpassing US$1 billion annually in recent years, and the dedicated work of over 2,000 R&D employees across 10 countries who collaborate in integrated teams.

CSL's R&D organisation has made significant progress in key clinical programs spanning our four strategic scientific platforms and six therapeutic areas. Our R&D portfolio includes promising projects such as garadacimab, our anti-FXlla monoclonal antibody for the potential long-term prophylactic treatment of patients with hereditary angioedema (HAE), CSL112, which aims to reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events during the 90-day high-risk period following a heart attack, alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT; ZEMAIRA®) for the prevention and treatment of acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), KCENTRA® for improving survival in trauma patients experiencing life-threatening bleeding, clazakizumab for the treatment of patients with end stage kidney disease and for patients who have received a kidney transplant, and next-generation vaccine technologies like sa-mRNA and aQIVc to safeguard public health.

Moreover, our early-stage pipeline consists of other promising projects where CSL's R&D team strives to challenge the status quo and explore improved options for people and patients.

While our R&D portfolio focuses on innovation in new products, improved products and enhanced manufacturing expertise, we acknowledge the importance of collaboration and recognise that we cannot – and should not – tackle this alone. Consequently, our R&D endeavours involve identifying and establishing strategic partnerships that align with our therapeutic areas of focus and increase the likelihood of introducing disruptive and beneficial innovations. Notable examples include the partnership with UniQure where CSL has exclusive global licence rights to commercialise HEMGENIX® (etranacogene bezaparvovec), an AAV5 (adeno-associated virus) gene therapy for the treatment of adult patients with haemophilia B and which was first launched in 2023, as well as the collaboration with sa-mRNA-focused Arcturus Therapeutics, which complements CSL's long-term vaccines strategy.

# Delivering digital

CSL's digital transformation journey continues with efforts to improve our foundation while driving innovation. Demand for information and technology services continues to increase across the CSL Group, a by product of growth and business integration.

From a digital foundation perspective, CSL continues to move from physical infrastructure to a virtual environment. Benefits of this include the ability to scale up and down quickly to meet business needs and improve data accessibility across the enterprise. CSL continuously reviews its enterprise resource plan and looks for opportunities to improve productivity by using data.

An example of how digital has helped with growing CSL's plasma collections is the use of the CSL Plasma App which has been downloaded over 3 million times. Digital investments like the CSL Plasma App also help to create personal and integrated relationships with our donors in addition to the more traditional methods of connecting via text, phone, in-person and the website.

CSL continues to support its life scientists and data scientists with automation, artificial intelligence and a stronger data and analytics platform. Moving more to the cloud will enhance our ability to work with an ever-growing ecosystem of partners and help us prepare for future growth by being better integrated.

# Advancing promising futures

CSL's people – which include more than 32,000 colleagues around the world – and our values-based culture are at the core of CSL's 2030 Strategy. Investing in people and culture is an enterprise-wide priority. There are a variety of initiatives in place to continue attracting, developing, rewarding and retaining top talent while fostering a collaborative, inclusive, global and dynamic environment that drives innovation and motivates the best and brightest to succeed.

At CSL, we believe our people can enjoy promising futures where they fulfill their individual career aspirations and potential and are inspired by a purpose-driven company that saves lives and protects public health. At every level of the organisation, we focus on:

- enabling career management and development with special attention to our front-line leaders;  
ensuring successor readiness through leadership development planning and rotational assignments that support a robust leadership pipeline now and into the future;  
enhancing our diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) outcomes; and  
- engaging employees and key stakeholders to continuously improve the employee and patient experience.

For additional information about our people and culture priorities and progress, please refer to the CSL's People section of this report on page 40.

# Sustainability

Sustainability is a focus of our strategy. Being a responsible partner across our three strategic pillars of environment, social and sustainable workforce is important to our ambitious vision for a healthier world.

For our environmental pillar last year, we set meaningful Paris Climate Agreement-aligned emissions reduction targets. This year, we have embedded foundational management processes to support execution against these targets (see section 8 for more information) and have submitted our near-term ambition for direct and indirect emissions reduction targets to the Science Based Targets initiative for validation and endorsement.

We have also made clear progress on our social pillar. Subject matter expert working groups from across functions have begun to explore areas of opportunity and strength across our identified focus areas of plasma donor experience, patient experience and access to our therapies (see section 9 for more information). As a science-based organisation, we are working pragmatically to develop meaningful objectives across these focus areas to further enhance existing shared value for our stakeholders and communities. Last year, for our workforce, we established near-term and long-term gender-based targets and continue to implement DE&I programs across our regions and operations (see section 7 for more information).

Ultimately, our sustainability strategy, along with a determined focus on constant improvement across our priority material sustainability topics, means that CSL can continue to develop and supply products that save lives and protect public health, now and well into the future.

For more information on performance, material topics and how CSL contributes to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, visit our expanded presence on CSL.com (Sustainability).

![](images/d894c01c4afa798d9f80ab668dc7b8aad422be74113c0d8b69592626a48d2fde.jpg)

CSL operates in a fast paced and constantly evolving environment of science, technology and healthcare. Although there are many risks inherent with operating in these environments and industries, for example research and development, intellectual property and clinical trial risks, CSL regularly reviews its group risk profile to identify and assess material business risks. This includes external and emerging risks that could affect CSL's global operations.

We are also exposed more broadly to external risks such as the escalating trend of cyber threats and data privacy breaches and we regularly review our group risk profile to proactively identify material business risks and opportunities and assess external risks that could affect our global operations. Managing risks includes both the mitigation of disruptive risks and the preparation for seizing opportunities. Our global Enterprise Risk Management Framework is designed to ensure robust risk oversight that is fit-for-purpose for both the operation of our business and to support our strategy and deliver on our commitments to patients and public health.

As part of CSL's enterprise risk management process, the Board and management team have identified the key risks that are material to CSL. These material group risks are described below along with an explanation of our approach to managing them in the context of delivering on our 2030 Strategy. Key financial risks are set out in Note 11 (Financial Risk Management) to the Financial Statements.

There are other risks that are inherent in the vaccine, plasma therapies and pharmaceutical industries, including iron deficiency and nephrology, besides those detailed below or in the Financial Statements, that could also adversely affect CSL's business and operations.

# Patient safety and product quality

Patient safety is paramount for CSL's ongoing sustainability as a global biotechnology leader and our long-term strategy of efficiency and reliable supply. When we talk about patient safety, we mean both in the use and administration of registered products as well as in the conduct of our clinical trials. While it is inherent in our industry that patients and trial participants may sometimes experience adverse reactions to therapies, CSL's manufacturing, product quality assurance and pharmacovigilance practices serve to ensure the highest standards of safety and the preservation of our reputational integrity.

Our processes and procedures adhere to global good pharmacovigilance practice (GPV) and good clinical practice (GCP) standards, and we seek to ensure that product information is up-to-date and contains all relevant information to assist healthcare practitioners to appropriately prescribe CSL products. For clinical trials, participants are informed about and acknowledge awareness of the potential benefits and risks of participation in the trial through use of Informed Consent Forms approved by relevant regulators, institutional review boards and independent ethics committees. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative safety signal detection activities are performed throughout the development programs and the lifecycles of our marketed products. Furthermore, our pharmacovigilance risk management systems seek to ensure that potential and identified safety risks are proactively addressed and above all appropriately mitigated.

In terms of meeting product quality requirements through our manufacturing and supply, we adopt and comply with a broad suite of internationally recognised standards through the CSL Quality Management System, including good manufacturing practice, and good distribution practice (GDP) that includes audits of third-party vendors and suppliers. We are frequently inspected by independent regulatory authorities auditing compliance with these standards.

# Product innovation and competition

We recognise that an impediment to delivering on our innovation and sustainable growth strategies is the changing competitive landscape for new technologies and disruptive therapies, such as gene and cell therapies. This material risk may alter the economics and characteristics of, and the demand for, CSL's plasma and adjacent therapies, and may also affect our platforms and capabilities in plasma fractionation, recombinant technology, cell and gene therapy and vaccines technology.

We strategically review our existing and future product pipeline against market demand and continually evaluate our competitive landscape. A key part of our strategy includes diversity through our multiple therapeutic areas and scientific platforms. We incorporate product lifecycle development and management, as well as development of new therapies, in strategies for each therapeutic area. In addition to proprietary research, CSL's competitive approach includes licensing, acquiring or partnering with third parties to remain competitive and advance growth within our chosen therapeutic areas.

With respect to continued growth and innovation in the competitive global influenza vaccine market, we recognise the need to continue leading in the development and manufacture of influenza vaccines including cell-culture technology and investigating the use of next-generation mRNA technology for the development of both influenza and COVID-19 vaccines. Failure to capitalise on innovative technology will diminish growth in this product sector, whereas success will deliver competitive advantages.

# Supply, capacity and operations

Having a sustainable and reliable supply chain is critical to the success of our 2030 Strategy, particularly to achieving consistent, economical and efficient supply. Any disruption to supply has the potential to impact our operations. We constantly monitor the demand for our products over a 10-year horizon as well as our capacity to collect and acquire human plasma, iron, eggs and other raw materials essential to the manufacture of our products.

We also monitor the scalability of specialised companies that supply raw materials, software and bespoke manufacturing equipment to match our business demand and growth objectives.

In our United States and European plasma collection centres, we use modern techniques and technologies to facilitate the safest, most efficient donation process. We consistently update our plasma collection centres to seek to provide a comfortable and safe donor experience. External sources of plasma may be used as needed and available to supplement collections to meet demand.

We endeavour to invest in manufacturing capacity ahead of projected demand to ensure that we can supply the needs of patients. Our operations also accommodate investments in technology and process improvements to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. Such improvements encompass strategies to increase the yield of both immunoglobulin and cell-based influenza vaccines, along with boosting the throughput of our existing facilities. We are actively engaged in developing an array of new therapies, including plasma-derived, recombinant, iron-based, cell-based and sa-mRNA vaccines, and gene therapies to maximise the utilisation of our global R&D and manufacturing network.

Our global network strategy continually evaluates short-, mid-, and long-term needs to inform decisions on capital and operational expenditures, including the use of expert third party providers to ensure a resilient, reliable and sustainable supply chain. We examine and prioritise our operational effectiveness efforts, capital plans, inventory targets, supply chain visibility, distribution and regulatory strategies to enhance the positions of our products from a business continuity and supply chain resilience standpoint.

# Market access

Policy making around market access is a multi-stakeholder engagement process, which includes governments, payers/ insurers, patient advocacy groups, medical societies and non-governmental organisations. We recognise that if we are not successful in maintaining an economic and reliable supply of our therapies for our stakeholders, or do not adopt responsible pricing, it may adversely affect our ability to execute our strategy, deliver sustainable growth and uphold our corporate reputation. We further recognise that macroeconomic pressures on governments and payers may impair access, growth and new market entries. We work closely with stakeholders in all countries where we market our products and continually seek to ensure pricing of our therapies reflects the value they bring to the people who need them and to health systems, and remains competitive and responsible. By continuing to innovate in our product portfolio, we can serve the unmet needs of more people and expand our access to more countries.

# People and culture

CSL's people and our commitment to fostering an inclusive, values-driven culture are integral to meeting and exceeding the standards expected by our stakeholders and the community. We have a variety of programs and policies in place, including our Speak Up Policy and our Code of Responsible Business Practice (CRBP), to ensure that our CSL Values guide how we work and operate around the world. We recognise that having a strong values driven culture where our employees act with integrity helps build internal and external trust and ultimately protects and builds CSL's reputation.

We also recognise the need to have the right people with the right skills in the right roles in order to execute our 2030 Strategy. As we focus on attracting, developing and retaining top talent in this globally competitive environment, we regularly review best practices, and benchmark ourselves against the markets in which we operate with the goal of offering total rewards that are both compelling and competitive with our peers and competitors.

In addition, we understand that the workplace and our employees' needs are constantly evolving, and we offer flexible work options and opportunities for them to stay connected regardless of location. We constantly challenge ourselves to create an engaging and collaborative environment where our people can drive innovation and focus on meaningful, valuable work. Our employee brand, Promising FUTURES, represents CSL's investment in the overall employee experience, with an emphasis on digitalisation and automation, collaboration, connectivity and inclusion, employee development and customised rewards for attracting and retaining next-generation talent.

# Privacy and cybersecurity

Ensuring the privacy and security of our data, including that of our patients, donors and employees, is of critical importance to CSL. We recognise the escalating risk of cyber threats and data privacy breaches targeting individuals and organisations. These cyberattacks constantly evolve, ranging from sophisticated phishing scams to attacks on critical infrastructure. Additionally, breaches of our information technology (IT) security and unauthorised or inadvertent release of information, caused by human error, malware or espionage, may compromise the privacy and security of the data we hold.

To address these challenges, CSL maintains a proactive stance by continuously monitoring and assessing cybersecurity threats. We have designed and implemented robust security controls for our IT systems, infrastructure and data, based on our understanding of known threats and industry best practices, and external testing to ensure their effectiveness.

Furthermore, we understand that awareness and preparedness are key in responding to cyberattacks and safeguarding data privacy. As such, we place great emphasis on providing ongoing education and training to our employees. By equipping them with the knowledge and skills to recognise and appropriately respond to cyber threats, we strive to empower our employees to effectively mitigate risks and promptly report any privacy breaches.

CSL remains dedicated to upholding the privacy and security of all data entrusted to us. Through our monitoring, privacy and security controls, and training programs, we commit to maintaining high standards of cybersecurity and data protection.

Further details about our enterprise risk management framework and how we manage our business risks is provided in our 2023 Corporate Governance Statement available on CSL.com (We Are CSL > Corporate Governance).

Over the last 12 months CSL has taken steps to create an integrated and simpler organisation with focus on its three businesses, CSL Behring (which includes CSL Plasma), CSL Vifor and CSL Seqirus.

These businesses are supported by CSL's global enabling functions, global R&D organisation and global centres of excellence.

The ongoing integration of CSL Vifor, combined with continued investment in CSL's people and in digital transformation provides a good foundation for CSL to continue executing its 2030 Strategy.

# In the medium term

CSL Behring expects to continue to grow through fulfilling unmet demand for products driven by increased plasma collections, developing differentiated plasma-derived and recombinant products, expanding markets and indications for those products and developing cell and gene therapies.

CSL Seqirus expects growth with its portfolio of differentiated products, including its adjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine in the 65 years and over market.

CSL Vifor's growth is largely focused on unlocking the value and growth within this newly acquired business by bringing together CSL's research and development capabilities into the one R&D organisation. We are also combining nephrology and transplant therapeutic areas and have a number of patient blood management initiatives underway that cross between CSL Vifor and CSL Behring.

# In the longer term

CSL expects sustained demand for immunoglobulins driven by significant need in Primary Immune Deficiency and Secondary Immune Deficiency. In the haematology therapeutic area, HEMGENIX®, CSL's one-time gene therapy for the treatment of adults with haemophilia B, provides another option to patients, complementing IDELVION®, a long-acting recombinant factor IX product. CSL also expects demand for vaccines to continue and be supported with its new recombinant protein and next-generation mRNA technologies. There remains significant unmet need for products to address anaemia, and CSL Vifor will continue to play an important role in this therapeutic area.

Further information about CSL's product pipeline is set out on pages 10 and 11 and details of new products being brought to market are set out on pages 14 and 15.

Driven by its promise to patients, and guided by its Values in decision making, CSL remains committed to delivering innovative medicines that save lives, protect public health and help people with life-threatening medical conditions to live full lives.

More information in relation to CSL's outlook is provided in the Chair and CEO messages, and further information on the factors that could affect this section is provided in CSL's Material Risks on page 26.

# Our digital transformation

The biopharmaceutical industry is on the precipice of significant disruptive innovation and change that will have far-reaching impacts for both companies and the people they serve. Various factors, such as growing demand, escalating costs of product development, pressure to reduce drug prices and the need for enhanced patient access, are intensifying the competitive landscape. Companies that embrace and effectively use digital technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and large-scale data sets, will gain a competitive advantage in the present and future. As CSL grows, it is undertaking considered and purposeful measures to establish a robust digital framework throughout the organisation to support new levels of productivity, growth and sustainability.

# Why do we need disruptive innovation? Because our patients, public health, employees and the CSL business are relying on its transformative impact

To be an innovator means that, at times, you will disrupt the status quo and challenge orthodoxies to achieve better outcomes. At CSL, we have a history of disrupting 'the way things are'. Equally, we are not afraid to also disrupt ourselves if it means an even better experience or outcome for patients and public health. Fast paced digital transformation has the potential to transform manufacturing processes, including pharmaceutical production, but also has the potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of how we currently work in R&D. Digital tools to simulate, monitor and drive experimentation, offer new insights into the ability to make use of big data currently generated by CSL platforms, with the potential to fundamentally change the way we work in R&D.

To enhance efficiency through digital technology and analytics, CSL is currently undergoing a transformation in its approach to information and technology (IT) in order to complement laboratory spaces and wet laboratory benchtops.

As the working environment evolves in tandem with advancements in IT, it is crucial for CSL's scientists to adopt a 'bilingual' scientific approach. They must feel equally comfortable designing experiments and employing coding and mathematical techniques to manipulate extensive data sets. With the increasing digitalisation of our lives and processes, data science offers us the capability to delve deeper into analytical insights, optimise workflows and processes, and automate repetitive tasks, all freeing up more time to focus on the science and provide real-time insights to support decision making.

CSL's Biomedical Data Science Initiative (BDSI) aims to enhance R&D capabilities in utilising big data by introducing new technologies, processes, additional resources, personal development opportunities and new collaborative approaches. The initiative emphasises talent acquisition, partnerships, infrastructure development and cloud strategy to address the evolving needs of translational data science and support the transformation of our R&D organisation towards precision medicine. It will complement and bolster our existing R&D strengths and enables us to mitigate program risks by increasing the probability of success, providing deeper insights into diseases and assets, and optimising the design of clinical trials to be more efficient and timely.

In the future, it is likely that CSL's bench scientists will allocate a significant portion of their time to data analytics. Therefore, possessing strong programming and mathematical skills will be just as essential as traditional biomedical competencies, wet laboratory skills and result interpretation. With the right information and technology infrastructure and adaptable scientists who possess a blend of traditional and modern scientific skills, CSL is positioning itself to thrive in the 'Lab of the Future'.

![](images/7ea9d798157cf1e7cc145ad974b8974b9297fc022878e7c716a6d15dc2c96b86.jpg)

As drug development changes, we invest continuously in upskilling our people. That helps scientists feel safer with change because they understand that they will be part of how the company evolves.

Dr Douglas Lee, Senior Vice President,

Plasma Product Development

CSL, along with experts within and beyond the organisation, operates within an ecosystem of digital-to-physical research tools that enhance human capabilities, enabling us to tackle increasingly complex experiments. Automation, robotics, artificial intelligence and machine learning are transforming our interactions with our laboratories. Importantly, this ecosystem fosters integration of external partners and collaborators as extensions of CSL's R&D functions.

CSL's R&D organisation is actively incorporating innovation into its infrastructure across global hubs for future readiness. Here are some examples of innovation within CSL's Product Development teams:

- Automation plays a vital role in our vision for the 'Lab of The Future'. The initial focus is on automating scientific workflows within the laboratory environment to increase accuracy, enhance result reproducibility and improve efficiency by decoupling productivity from scientists. An automation platform including purification and analytical equipment is already deployed in Marburg and is planned for implementation at CSL Melbourne in 2023. Automation systems will enable us to increase productivity independent of the time allocated by our scientists.  
- CSL's future of product development and clinical manufacturing lies in the adoption of model-based process development. In-silico models, representing the digital twins of physical assets, are used to simulate processes without undertaking 'wet-lab' experiments, significantly reducing the experimental burden, improving efficiency and accelerating progress towards clinical studies and the market. Continuous refinement of the models further enhances their effectiveness and through this, CSL seeks to bring about a transformative leap in our operational abilities.

- CSL has introduced an innovative technology platform that aims to expedite the delivery of medicine to patients by providing a unified platform for connecting dispersed teams and locations, both internal and external, to accelerate the end-to-end drug product lifecycle. Given CSL's geographic spread in R&D, this offers enormous potential for greater collaboration. When integrated with laboratory facilities, this advanced technology uses an augmented reality headset and a linked tablet, to offer immediate feedback, process instructions and real-time issue resolution within a pre-defined workflow. Currently, it is being used in the clinical manufacturing operations at CSL Melbourne to transition from paper-based records to a digital interface.  
- Scientists typically spend a significant amount of time handling samples and conducting experiments in person to make informed decisions. CSL and Monash University have initiated the AI Biochemist collaboration, which aims to enhance the efficiency of scientists by implementing an AI-guided, autonomous laboratory automation system. By integrating cutting-edge instruments with AI capabilities and robotic components, the project focuses on addressing the crucial task of providing a central 'brain' and command centre. By leveraging state-of-the-art technologies, we can automate laboratory operations making them more efficient with the aim of expediting scientific discovery, enhancing research quality and ultimately developing improved treatments for patients.

# Our strategic scientific platforms

To ensure a robust and diverse innovation pipeline based on a foundation of scientific excellence, CSL continues to strengthen its therapeutic area focus underpinned with robust technical development platforms. CSL uses its strategic technical platforms of plasma protein technology, recombinant protein technology, cell and gene therapy, and vaccines technology to support continued innovation and continually refine ways in which products can address unmet medical needs, help prevent infectious disease to protect public health, and help patients lead full lives.

<table><tr><td>Plasma Protein Technology</td><td>Plasma is a valuable resource for many current and potentially new biological therapies. We rely upon our donors to provide this life-saving resource and as such, CSL Behring has an obligation to maximise the value of each plasma donation through the development and delivery of important therapies for the benefit of patients. CSL&#x27;s yield and reliability programs for donated plasma continue to be an important, strategic area of focus for CSL as we strive to be the industry leader in plasma-derived therapies.</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant Protein Technology</td><td>Recombinant protein technology uses cells, grown in large batches, each as an individual protein production factory. This allows product supply to be reliably scaled (compared to plasma collection), ensuring a robust and resilient supply of products to patients. The capability to further manipulate the sequence of recombinant proteins permits a responsiveness to achieve desired therapeutic goals, such as the ability to replace a patient&#x27;s own deficient or inactive protein, selectively target specific biological mechanisms, enhance potency and improve pharmacokinetics, resulting in more effective, highly differentiated medicines with the potential to optimise the route and frequency of delivery. CSL&#x27;s garadacimab program highlights the value of monoclonal antibodies, a specific subset of recombinant proteins that are developed to have a highly specific targeting to block or enhance certain biologic or immune processes which lead to disease states. The specificity of the targeting of monoclonal antibodies ensures very high efficacy with minimal side-effects.</td></tr><tr><td>Cell and Gene Therapy</td><td>Cell and gene therapies are highly innovative, next-generation products that, after decades of research and development, are now starting to improve the lives of patients with serious diseases. For diseases with few effective therapeutic options, such as certain blood cell cancers, or where successful therapy has required a lifetime of regular symptomatic treatment, such as rare inherited genetic deficiencies, they offer the promise of a long-term cure. The fundamental differentiating characteristic of cell and gene therapies is that the patient&#x27;s own cells are manipulated to produce the disease-correcting protein, either by removing the patient&#x27;s cells and modifying them or, as with HEMGENIX®, by using molecular machinery derived from viruses to deliver the therapeutic gene to the desired cell type within the patient&#x27;s body.</td></tr><tr><td>Vaccines Technology</td><td>CSL Seqirus is a global leader in influenza vaccine technologies for prevention and control of seasonal disease, and a transcontinental partner in pandemic preparedness. Our egg-based and cell-based manufacturing capabilities in three continents produce more than 100 million doses of influenza vaccines annually. Together with our MF59® adjuvant, our influenza vaccines help to meet the needs of different populations around the world. CSL&#x27;s ongoing commitment to population protection is evidenced through our innovative vaccines pipeline, which includes next-generation technologies such as next-generation mRNA and recombinant antigen production, to address emerging and present viral threats to human health.</td></tr></table>

Dr Andrew Nash, Chief Scientific Officer and Senior Vice President, Research

Identifying early stage external innovation opportunities, such as new technologies and assets, is essential for CSL's research portfolio to grow and diversify in the future. To expedite the commercialisation of promising discoveries that can address unmet patient needs, the Research External Innovation Team have established the CSL Research Acceleration Initiative (RAI) to form partnerships between CSL and research organisations worldwide. By fostering long-term collaborations with talented academic scientists, the RAI promotes innovation and offers crucial early funding as well as access to CSL's R&D experts.

Over the past four years, CSL has successfully established over 30 new collaborations with entrepreneurial scientists in Australia, Europe, and the United States through the RAI. Furthermore, CSL has strategically partnered with selected incubators, accelerators and venture funders worldwide to expand its access to external innovation.

These partnerships include Baselaunch, a Swiss-based venture builder that collaborates with scientists and entrepreneurs across Europe to develop cutting-edge therapeutics. In the United States, CSL joined forces with StartX, a global non-profit community consisting of over 800 companies affiliated with Stanford University and the Philadelphia-based Science Center; whilst in Australia, CSL is an investor in the Brandon BioCatalyst fund, which provides support for the development and commercialisation of early stage biomedical discoveries. Through these collaborative efforts and initiatives, CSL expands its global presence and strengthens its connection with innovative scientists and provides CSL with a significant competitive advantage in accessing ground breaking discoveries to build a sustainable and diverse R&D portfolio of promising bitherapies across various therapeutic areas.

Each year, CSL works to establish longer term strategic partnerships that will benefit CSL, CSL's academic partners and most importantly, our patients.

- CSL and WEHI celebrated an important milestone in May 2023 with the opening of newly refurbished laboratories for the Centre for Biologic Therapies (Centre). The Centre combines WEHI's expertise with CSL's experience in biologic drug discovery and development and its world-class human antibody library which will be the engine room of biologics discovery at the Centre. With its new laboratories within the Royal Melbourne Hospital, the Centre provides access to expert biologic discovery and optimisation capabilities accelerating drug development into the clinic, ultimately addressing a current gap in Australian medical research. The partners will contribute equal funding to the Centre, with a combined investment of A$10 million over five years.

![](images/ae60fd8e77d298cd6395a2cd48fec9ee0fc16da8dbaf1adbfc57f8baf6932ab9.jpg)

Collaborating to pair external unique technologies, assets and equipment with our strengths in research, clinical development, manufacturing, and commercialisation will help us reliably deliver the next and future generations of therapies to our patients. We are very purposeful in the culture, behaviours and mindset we establish when we decide to work with a partner. Better outcomes follow when the goal is both outcome and connection – at the heart of this thinking is a 'combinatorial' culture of complementary leadership and a spirit of true collaboration.

Dr Emmanuelle Lecomte-Brisset, Senior Vice President, Global Regulatory Affairs

- CSL and WEHI have also established the CSL WEHI Translational Data Science Alliance which will leverage CSL's expertise in drug development and WEHI's experience in bioinformatics to gain a deeper understanding of biotherapies and patient populations. Through this alliance, CSL's Research Data Science team will work alongside WEHI's highly skilled and world-renowned computational biologists and bioinformaticians, who will contribute innovative data analysis methods to help us advance therapeutics into the clinic. Additionally, this collaboration will greatly enhance R&D capabilities in bioinformatics, genomics and imaging at both CSL and WEHI through the utilisation of advanced technologies, platforms and talent development.  
- The Australian Research Council (ARC) Hub for Digital Bioprocess Development is part of the Industrial Transformation Research Hub grant scheme (ITRH Scheme) and has been established to support the biopharmaceutical industry by fostering digital innovation, productivity and competitiveness. It will draw together expertise from the University of Melbourne, University of Technology Sydney and RMIT University, together with CSL, Patheon and Pall and three leading international universities, forming a substantial team. The Hub will bring together an interdisciplinary team of engineers, scientists, and computing specialists to create digitally integrated advanced manufacturing processes and a platform for industry-wide adoption. This will include the development of novel process and digital models capable of predicting and optimising manufacturing processes resulting in improved yields, more efficient and flexible processes, and enhanced product stability. The ARC Hub for Digital Bioprocess Development will employ six CSL post-doctoral scientists and over 10 PhD students over a five-year period.

In support of the yearly seasonal influenza vaccine epidemic, CSL Seqirus collaborates with the World Health Organisation (WHO) Collaborating Centre in Melbourne, Australia to prepare vaccine seeds and potency reagents that are made widely available. This is an important contribution to assist with the global effort to prepare for the forthcoming vaccination season.

Influenza remains a significant global health concern and CSL is committed to collaborating with like-minded partners to advance our understanding of the human response to influenza and to discover new and innovative vaccine solutions for this and other respiratory viruses. By collaborating with Arcturus Therapeutics, CSL has gained access to Arcturus Therapeutics' advanced next-generation mRNA vaccine platform technology, which has shown promising results in a large Phase III study for COVID-19. Through this collaboration the commercialisation of a prospective COVID (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine has been significantly advanced and the partnership will continue to drive the development of new vaccines including seasonal influenza sa-mRNA vaccines.

# Strategic support for innovative medical research

One of CSL's core values is innovation and over the past year we have continued to support collaborative innovation through the endowment of the following awards to researchers around the world.

- The Heimburger Award is a global award available to researchers across the world. Professor Dr Norbert Heimburger, a CSL Behring employee for over three decades, was a pioneer of modern coagulation therapy. Among his many achievements, Prof. Dr Heimburger developed virus-safe plasma products based on pasteurisation, including launching the first effectively virus-inactivated FVIII concentrate in 1981. In his honour, CSL Behring created the Heimburger Award, recognising clinical and/or preclinical research of emerging coagulation specialists who are driven to improve the care of patients with bleeding disorders. In May 2022, five recipients from Australia, Belgium, Ireland, Italy and the Netherlands received this award.  
- In October 2022, two Australian scientists were each awarded a CSL Centenary Fellowship, valued at A$1.25 million over five years. Dr Samuel Forster will use his fellowship to fund research to unravel how some bacteria influence the gut's immune system and contribute to inflammatory bowel disease, a chronic, painful and disruptive condition. And the help of the fellowship will assist Dr Michelle Boyle to investigate how the malaria parasite can disrupt the body's immune response, reducing the effectiveness of vaccination in children in malaria-affected communities. Both of these research projects will generate fundamental knowledge that could transform how we fight these diseases to improve outcomes for patients.

# Listening to our patients' needs

The ability to collaborate with patients and their support networks remains an essential part of CSL's efforts to make a meaningful difference to the lives of patients and to public health. We have continued to exemplify our dedication to understanding patients' needs by expanding internal and external partnerships and engaging with industry partners who share similar values regarding patient focus. Through these important partnerships, CSL is navigating critically important areas which have a direct impact on areas such as patient diversity and inclusion in drug development, health equity and leveraging enabling technologies to improve how we interact with patients across R&D. CSL is inviting patients to directly comment on how it is discovering and developing the next wave of important therapies. These strategic efforts have resulted in numerous insights, improvements and efficiencies in CSL's development programs and how the R&D pipeline is delivered.

# Clinical trials in progress and new

In 2022/23, CSL had 60 clinical trials in operation across all therapeutic areas. Of those, 12 had a first patient enrolled in the trial during the year.

CSL conducts clinical trials ethically and adheres to the highest standards of integrity in the formulation, conduct and reporting of scientific research. This is based upon three primary elements: scientific integrity; patient safety; and investigator objectivity.

![](images/ee7cffc82be0b64548d6bde2bd537ffa574693d477b0b3cb03276e32ecf05f71.jpg)

# 60

clinical trials in operation across all therapeutic areas

# 10

regulatory authority inspections with no impact to clinical trial conduct

The CSL Clinical Quality Management System allows CSL to monitor and effectively oversee the quality of clinical trials and includes both regulatory authority inspections and internal audits for good clinical practice (GCP), good pharmacovigilance practice (GVP), good manufacturing practice (GMP), good laboratory practice (GLP) and good research laboratory practice (GRLP).

Over the reporting period, 16 clinical trials were added, and 11 clinical trial results were posted, on an International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE)-recognised public clinical trial registry. These were all disclosed in a timely manner and in compliance with CSL's transparency policy. This policy reflects international requirements and standards including requirements from ICMJE, WHO guidance and legislative requirements.

In addition, 10 inspections were undertaken by regulatory agencies including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA). All inspections confirmed adherence with GCP requirements, validated the data integrity of our clinical trials and had no impact on clinical trial operations.

# When patients speak, CSL listens

CSL continues to improve clinical trial performance and reduce patient burden of participation, and we listened to patients to make it happen. Over the last 12 months, through direct patient feedback, we made multiple protocol modifications during the design stage for several high priority clinical trials. Addressing these protocol design challenges early resulted in a reduction in the number of protocol amendments during the conduct of the clinical trials. Patient insights also helped drive innovation within R&D by enabling us to identify several new capabilities which were incorporated into our clinical trials. Overall, listening to our patient advisory boards resulted in changes which helped reduce the patient burden in CSL clinical trials; making it more feasible for patients to participate in these studies and thus helping to advance our newer therapies towards those patients in need.

# Our highest priority is the safety and wellbeing of our employees, donors and patients.

Guided by our Values, CSL's success starts with a workplace where our people can do their best work and continue to develop and grow. Most of CSL's employees work onsite in manufacturing facilities or plasma donation centres to produce life-saving medicines and vaccines for those we have the privilege to serve.

The diverse perspectives, backgrounds and experiences of our more than 32,000 colleagues around the world strengthen our company, inspire our innovation and make CSL an engaging place to work. Fostering a diverse and inclusive culture helps us better understand and connect with our donors, patients and other stakeholders.

# Building a diverse workforce, inclusive culture and equitable organisation

Our Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I) agenda focuses on building a diverse workforce, an inclusive workplace and an equitable organisation. Therefore, DE&I is embedded in everything we do – from how we attract talent and support our employees to how we engage with the communities in which we live and work. We consider diversity in the broadest terms, including gender, nationality, ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, generation/age, socioeconomic status, marital/family status, religious belief, language, professional and educational background, and cultural experience. Focusing on diversity alone is not enough. We also invest in our culture and managers' skills to ensure our people feel like they belong (inclusion), and they are treated fairly and have equal access to opportunities (equity). CSL's Global Diversity and Inclusion Policy is available on CSL.com (We Are CSL > Corporate Governance > Core Policies).

Our DE&I Strategy focuses on three pillars with multiyear, measurable objectives to ensure our ongoing progress.

- Diverse workforce: Build a more diverse workforce, including achieving positive progress toward gender diversity within management and senior executive levels, while reflecting ethnic, cultural and disability diversity, so that we bring a wide variety of viewpoints to the important decisions we make and problems we solve.  
- Inclusive culture: Foster an inclusive culture in which all employees are respected, valued and inspired to do their best work, including implementing an internal global DE&I series to develop employees on inclusive behaviours and other DE&I topics.  
- Marketplace reputation: Enhance our external reputation by partnering with organisations and suppliers who share our passion for DE&I and support us in achieving our objectives.

We review our progress toward meeting our long-term DE&I goals annually, identifying short-term objectives to address areas where additional attention is needed. In addition, we follow both representational data as well as key performance indicators to ensure our talent practices are inclusive and equitable.

We continue to make positive strides in our workforce demographics as we aim to achieve greater diversity in the composition of our senior executive and people manager populations. Looking at our year-end gender composition as of 30 June 2023, the following charts, which include employee data from our CSL Vifor business unit since it joined the CSL family in 2023, highlight the proportion of women and men on the CSL Board of Directors, in senior executive positions (senior director and above), in the role of people managers (with three or more direct reports) as well as all employees across the entire organisation.

# Providing promising futures

We want our people to have Promising Futures where they fulfill their individual career aspirations and potential and are inspired by a purpose-driven company with a values-based culture. CSL continues to invest in a variety of programs, such as health and wellness, training and development, and rewards and recognition, that reflect our commitment to helping employees develop and thrive.

Additionally, CSL believes in the power of education to create opportunities and change peoples' lives. CSL's Promising FUTURES Scholarship Program provides financial assistance to employees and their dependents for technical school, vocational school, two- and four-year colleges or advanced education. The program was specifically designed to support individuals from traditionally underprivileged, underrepresented communities – those who have had to overcome substantial obstacles to pursue their studies or first-generation college students.

We launched the program in 2021 in the United States, and expanded it to Australia the following year. In Australia in 2022, we awarded two scholarships and in 2023, there were three successful applicants. Our 2023 United States scholarship program also included our CSL Vifor colleagues based in the United States and garnered the highest participation to date with 112 applicants. Of those,  $70\%$  identified as women,  $<1\%$  as nonbinary/third gender and  $66\%$  as racially diverse. Thirty-seven scholarships were awarded.

This scholarship is confirmation to me that CSL is a great organisation that is truly looking to invest in young people, future leaders and folks who are interested in the life sciences. Davin is pursuing a Biological Sciences degree that may, one day, lead him to a company like CSL. I'm just so pleased that CSL wants to invest in my son's future and is recognising him not only for his grades and academic pursuits, but also for his leadership qualities.

# Attracting and advancing future talent

The company's early career programs for STEM talent around the globe help to build CSL's future talent pipeline.

The Australian Graduate Program is a two-year rotational program that focuses on attracting, developing and retaining top graduates who are ambitious, innovative and tech-savvy. The program offers undergraduates career opportunities within our global businesses through cross-functional rotations and specialised development. Since the program's inception, we have recruited 84 graduates with  $96\%$  conversion into roles post-program and an  $84\%$  retention rate.

CSL's Australian Internship Program is a paid, 10-week program for university undergraduate and post-graduate students in their last year of study. The program provides hands-on experience and learning and development opportunities with exposure to various teams and functions across the business all while working alongside and learning from a diverse group of professionals who are leaders in their respective fields. Interns can also apply to be considered for early offers to join our award-winning Graduate Program in the following year.

The EMEA Trainee Program invites candidates, who recently graduated with a bachelor's, master's or doctorate degree, to participate in a two-year, cross-functional rotation program in the areas of Engineering, Marketing, Medical Affairs, Manufacturing, Quality and/or Research & Development (R&D). Candidates have an assigned mentor and take part in a wide range of development and networking opportunities, including leadership assessments, innovation sessions and project management. In 2022, four of the five Graduate Trainees, who completed the program across CSL Vifor, CSL Behring and CSL Seqirus, have secured full-time employment with CSL.

Our Apprenticeship and Dual Study Programs in Germany and Switzerland strengthen our talent pipeline across multiple functions, including Manufacturing and R&D. Programs spanning three or four years adhere to all applicable regulatory requirements and include personal, professional and academic training to develop CSL's workforce of the future. Many of the apprentices and dual study students continue their career within CSL. To date, more than 100 apprentices have completed apprenticeships in Germany and Switzerland, and 30 participants completed the Dual Study Program. In 2022, both programs saw a conversion rate of  $80\%$ .

Attracting students enrolled in a four-year college or university, CSL's North America Internship & Co-op Program spans 12 to 26 weeks and builds on classroom theory to provide students with practical, hands-on experiences involving multiple CSL entities, functions and locations. Interns and co-op participants participate in a variety of development opportunities, including an Insights Discovery Assessment, skill-building workshops and business-specific training. Additionally, CSL employees serve as mentors, offering career advice and support. This year, CSL hired 43 students across four sites in the United States.

# Developing future leaders

We maintain a wide range of professional and personal development programs to meet the evolving needs and expectations of our leaders, whether they manage a team or a project and need to get work done through others. From developing strategy and executing with excellence to driving innovation and fostering an inclusive culture, the role of a leader has never been more critical. That is why we continue to support the ongoing development of CSL's leaders now and for the future. Following are descriptions of some of our development offerings.

Mentoring: Mentoring of people leaders is an important component of our learning and development investments. Currently, more than 500 colleagues –  $47\%$  of whom are women – participate in our global mentoring program.

High Potential Talent Development: Our Executive Edge program accelerates the development of high potential senior leaders to help prepare them for executive roles.

![](images/dded033c372868627d32b8d04c9d52d7bf09bc96e00817c4b687c32acc863e3c.jpg)

The program focuses on leading strategy and people with an enterprise and inclusive mindset and offers an immersive in-market experience, executive exposure and networking, and engagement in a strategic project tied to the company's strategy. It also includes a specialised track for female participants, providing guidance on handling headwinds specific to women's career advancement, exposure to external female C-suite executives and the opportunity for ongoing mentoring and sponsorship. Our first cohort completed the program in 2023 and included 23 participants, of which  $48\%$  were women.

Leadership Development: Leadership Excellence is a program specially designed for associate directors and directors across all areas of our business. The curriculum centres on leadership agility and translating future trends into enterprise strategy. It also includes business simulations, peer learning activities and reverse mentoring to broaden participant perspectives. In the past year, we also launched an alumni network to sustain cross-functional learning beyond the program. To date, nearly 491 CSL leaders participated across five cohorts –  $50\%$  women and  $50\%$  men of those who declared gender identity.

Management Development: Management Essentials is a program for managers and senior managers across all areas of our business. Topics include the role of a leader, building trust, communication and feedback, coaching, change and inclusive leadership with a focus on the individual biases that affect relationships, collaboration and performance. Participants are provided with an immersive learning experience for which they complete self-paced asynchronous modules and engage in moderated chat rooms. They also receive live virtual coaching from a dedicated expert to help reinforce learning and its application. To date, there have been 342 graduates (51% women, 48% men, 1% did not identify gender) from the CSL Behring, CSL Seqirus and CSL Vifor business units and 529 participants (67% women and 33% men) from our CSL Plasma business.

Frontline Leader Development: The Frontline Leader program provides foundational business and people management skills for supervisors and newly promoted managers across the Operations organisation. Coursework is designed to enhance leadership and management skills, Human Resources & Legal compliance knowledge and Enterprise Operations business acumen. Launched in 2022, the program is offered at all CSL manufacturing sites. By the end of the 2022/23 financial year, 1,230 leaders have participated in the program.

Professional Development: Our Discovery program focuses on enhancing the knowledge and capabilities of our self-led, individual contributors through the development of their own personal effectiveness, expanded self-awareness and collaboration capabilities, and improved change and time-management skills. There are 237 participants –  $59\%$  female and  $41\%$  male – in our 2023 cohort.

Emerging Leader Development: C@talyst is an emerging leader program run within the CSL Seqirus business across the APAC, EMEA and Americas regions. The current cohort of 60 is comprised of  $62\%$  women and  $38\%$  men. This program will be scaled to additional business units across CSL in the upcoming financial year.

# Valuing colleagues' contributions

We strive to create an environment where people excel in their job and make meaningful contributions that drive superior performance and sustainable growth – all while demonstrating our CSL Values.

Over the past year, we refreshed our approach to how we enable our people to perform at their best and reward them for it. Updates to CSL's performance management framework have included:

- reinforcing our CSL Values, considering both 'what' our employees contribute and 'how' they contribute in terms of their behaviours;  
- continuing to foster a culture of ongoing feedback and dialogue to ensure a strong link between performance and employee development year-round; and  
- improving CSL's Short-Term Incentive Plan, including the ability to differentiate and award bonus amounts that better match our employees' unique contributions, along with an increased maximum bonus potential for our highest performers who achieve stretch objectives.

Our employees are well prepared to set clear goals that are linked to company priorities, share feedback with each other regularly and embrace development opportunities while we work together to deliver for our patients and protect public health.

Another way we recognise employee efforts is through CSL's global recognition program, Celebrate the Promise, an online platform that enables employees and leaders to easily recognise anyone at any time – from a simple thank you to acknowledgement of a major accomplishment.

Each recognition is tied to one of CSL's Values (Patient Focus, Innovation, Integrity, Collaboration and Superior Performance). For significant achievements, employees may receive points, which can be used to purchase merchandise from an online catalogue. Since launching the program in September 2020, employees have shared more than 400,261 global recognition moments, with Collaboration and Superior Performance being the top two most-recognised CSL Values.

# Listening to our people

We continue listening to our employees' views on critical aspects related to working at CSL, and each year, we invite employees to provide feedback through our Employee Engagement Survey. This year's survey included our CSL Vifor colleagues. In 2023, a record number of employees – 24,660 – shared their views on a variety of topics, including CSL's vision, the ability to balance work and life, collaboration across the enterprise, demonstration of our CSL Values and support for employee growth and development. That number represents  $76\%$ * of our employee population, nearly 4,000 more employee voices than we have ever heard from before.

This year's Engagement Index is  $76.2^{*}$ , relatively flat from last year's survey and on par with the global external benchmark maintained by our survey administrator, Perceptyx, that represents responses from over 11 million employees across multiple industries and geographies. As in prior years, each member of our Global Leadership Group analyses their respective results to identify a few meaningful engagement objectives and related action plans for the new financial year. We also provide training to our people leaders, helping them interpret team results and identify strengths on which to build or opportunities to improve. In addition to these ongoing efforts and new for the 2023/24 financial year, we have established an enterprise action plan, sponsored by senior leadership, that will focus on specific areas identified by employees, including increased recognition of superior performance, more leader-led communications to help our people feel better connected to our purpose and strategy, and continued emphasis on wellness with quarterly, company-wide 'No Scheduled Meetings Weeks' to offer employees more time on innovative solutions to challenges as well as their own development and wellbeing.

Throughout the year, we leveraged our listening strategy as we welcomed our CSL Vifor teammates to the CSL family, soliciting their feedback throughout the integration process. In addition, we conducted Values workshops to familiarise colleagues with our company Values and the behaviours that bring them to life.

Additionally, we are taking steps to enhance the employee experience while meeting the evolving needs of the organisation. We established a cross-functional, cross-geography advisory group to provide input as we work together to ensure that CSL's workforce is connected, productive, engaged and supported with critical capabilities as the needs of our business and the future of work continue to evolve.

# Caring for our people

The health, safety and wellbeing of our people is a top priority at CSL, and with a newly established health and wellbeing steering committee, the company is even more focused and coordinated in its efforts to support them. We have implemented numerous programs designed to enhance our employees' physical, emotional and financial health.

Some enhancements have included:

- offering employees two wellness days for the third year in a row so they have time to focus on their physical and emotional wellbeing when they need it most;  
- expanding and modernising CSL's global Employee Assistance Program by providing eight behavioural health sessions to all employees and their dependants at no cost and with improved access to providers;  
- promoting use of Headspace, a mental health and wellbeing app, among employees in nearly all locations;  
- augmenting CSL's existing leave offerings by providing more options to assist global caregivers with paid time off and accommodate those who need additional time away from work;  
- reviewing and adjusting health and risk coverage in all major geographies to ensure employees have access to care specifically needed in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, including coverage for death and disability, inpatient and outpatient services, COVID-19 testing, vaccination, telemedicine, and paediatric/maternal care;  
- introducing a charitable matching contribution program for employees in the United States and Australia;  
- providing family formation benefits and gender affirmation coverage to employees in United States locations; and  
- offering employees in United States locations additional support to help them find and pay for back-up care for children, elders and pets.

As our people balance a variety of professional and personal demands, we continue to support workplace flexibility. We established a hybrid work environment for those whose roles permit remote work, and to support those whose presence at work is required, we embedded an ongoing emphasis on safety and enhanced recognition for essential employees.

# Ensuring a sustainable workforce

A sustainable workforce is a focus of our business growth and future success, and it's one of the pillars of our Sustainability Strategy.

Over the past year, we have continued taking steps to:

- raise awareness, visibility and action, by promoting sustainability across the end-to-end working experience;  
- inform and involve employees in programs that maximise diversity, equity and inclusion; and  
- ensure employees have access and opportunity to engage with community-giving programs and volunteering within our communities.

We continually look for ways to engage our workforce on relevant aspects of our Sustainability Strategy. As we further embed activity surrounding the achievement of our environmental targets across the organisation – from manufacturing operations to other functions and levels of management – there is tremendous opportunity to actively engage our colleagues in our collective efforts. We anticipate increased involvement across our sites as we work to establish waste and water reduction targets whereby all our employees can directly support their achievement.

Meanwhile, employees are enthusiastic about the company's sustainability efforts. According to the 2023 Employee Engagement Survey,  $76.2\%^{*}$  said they feel good about the ways CSL contributes to the community – consistent with the prior year and on par with the global external benchmark maintained by our survey administrator.

Over the reporting period, in Australia, we have advanced our efforts to support reconciliation efforts with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders – the world's oldest continuous living culture. We have formed an employee-led working group of 14 passionate representatives from across our business units and functions to develop CSL's first Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP). Working with Reconciliation Australia – the lead body for reconciliation that aims to inspire and build relationships, respect and trust between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and non-Indigenous Australians – we seek to launch our Reflect RAP in the second half of 2023. Reconciliation Australia's Reflect RAP structure provides a robust and proven framework for scoping and developing relationships with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander stakeholders, deciding on CSL's vision for reconciliation and exploring our sphere of influence.

In 2022, we interviewed employees across our regions to help shape the scope and design of expanding our workplace giving programs beyond existing initiatives in the United States and Australia. Additionally, we explored a range of technology-based solutions to support the expansion. While we consider various options, CSL continues to support humanitarian relief efforts in geographies where our businesses operate (see page 58 for more information). We are excited about the prospect of enabling more employees to engage in local community-giving efforts, both through the donation of dollars and the contribution of time and talents.

# Promoting safety and wellbeing

CSL is committed to providing safe, healthy and secure workplaces for our employees, other persons present on our premises and the communities in which we operate.

Our Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Management System seeks to uphold our EHS principles that aim to keep people safe, protect the environment and build trust internally and externally. Each year, CSL establishes robust key performance indicators to measure our adherence to our values and drive improved results.

The EHS team works collaboratively with site operations management and employees to proactively identify and correct workplace hazards and risks, strengthen communication, define roles and responsibilities and promote a company-wide culture of safety at all of our manufacturing, plasma, laboratory and office locations.

Enablon®, a cloud-based EHS software solution has been implemented across the enterprise and is available for all employees, contractors and visitors to use for event reporting, incident investigation, inspections, corrective measures and metrics. Enablon® is a tool that allows CSL to standardise and automate safety reporting and processes across the organisation.

As part of CSL's commitment to continuously improving our EHS performance, CSL has updated many key aspects of the EHS Management System. These updates include improvements to core EHS elements of audit and governance, management review, incident reporting classification and escalation.

Our people are our most valuable asset. CSL continues to develop, implement, and improve our employee health and safety processes and programs to further promote a strong and inclusive safety culture. In 2022/23, CSL initiated a new global EHS committee to enhance our global health and wellness programs, bringing together health advocates from all over the CSL network to develop a global health and

wellness plan for deployment in 2023/24. The work in health and wellness will be paired with an investment into CSL's EHS culture and employee engagement processes, to further strength the employee experience in all areas of environmental health, safety and sustainability.

† Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) is the rate of injuries resulting in a fatality, lost time from work ≥ one day/shift, and medical treatment beyond first aid calculated as TRIFR = (# Injuries) × (1,000,000)/(hours worked). Includes employees and workers directly supervised by an CSL employee.  
$\ddagger$  Data is calculated over a 36-month period of time. Data is separated into CSL Plasma and non-CSL Plasma sites to account for the difference in the inherent hazards in plasma collection centres as compared to manufacturing facilities.  
^Applies globally to all operations and employees, including part-time employees, contracted employees, contingent workers, and temporary employees (or other individuals) whose work is directly supervised by a CSL employee. This includes contingent workers that perform work that is directly related to the company's core work and provide work direction from the Company. Does not apply to independent contractors: who perform non-core servicing, maintenance or construction related work. Work performed by an independent contractor is not controlled nor directed by CSL and its entities but by the hired party.  
# Includes CSL Vifor, Switzerland manufacturing facility and head office following the acquisition in August 2022.

While remaining low in relation to industry benchmarks, incident rates over the reporting period in CSL's plasma collection centres closed the year above target. Contributing factors include improved reporting via the deployment of the Enablon incident reporting system software, the continued growth of our plasma network, and the increased onboarding (due to turnover) of new employees. Several measures have been implemented to control the increase in non-serious incidents, and the associated impact on CSL Plasma's safety performance.

Our commitment to a healthier world means delivering for both people and our planet. For a century we have strived to provide our life-saving medicines in an efficient, inclusive and environmentally respectful way.

In addition to material topics featured, our strategic sustainability focus areas are listed below:

- Integrate sustainability considerations into business decisions.  
- Reduce carbon emissions.  
- Minimise end-to-end production of waste through removal, reduction and recycling.  
- Reduce waste and emissions across our supply chain.

# Promoting environmental protection

CSL recognises that responsible management and efficient use of natural resources is key to its sustainable growth and ability to enable efficient and reliable supply of our life-saving medicines.

CSL has an Environment, Health, Safety (EHS) function, which ensures our facilities operate to industry and regulatory standards. This strategy includes compliance with government regulations and commitments to minimise the impact of our operations on the environment. Our EHS Management System provides the platform for policies, procedures and guidelines, which manage our business processes.

In April 2023, CSL's facility in Wuhan, China, was issued a violation by the environmental protection agency (EPA) for failing to meet discharge limits of chemical oxygen demand (COD) as outlined in the site's discharge permit. The penalty issued was US$16,548 (RMB120,000).

# Creating an impact on Earth Day

Earth Day on Saturday, 22 April, is an annual reminder of the impact human activity has on the environment and the need to invest in our planet to protect the future.

For Earth Day in 2023, several CSL sites across North America took part in volunteer activities in their communities, reinforcing both the business and personal commitment to the environment.

# South Carolina

Our CSL Plasma facility in Union, South Carolina, proudly signed-up as part of the local county's ADOPT-A-ROAD program – adopting Old Petrie Road in Spartanburg, South Carolina. The ADOPT-A-ROAD program is designed to keep the county's roadways litter-free. CSL has adopted a two-mile section of road and for the next two years will have volunteers working to pick up litter along the roadway across the year.

# North Carolina

For the second year in a row, CSL Seqirus in Holly Springs, North Carolina, celebrated Earth Day by helping clean up Bass Lake Park. Over 100 employees volunteered to spread mulch and collect rubbish on trails and along the lake.

# Illinois

At CSL Behring in Kankakee, Illinois, members of the leadership team and EHS volunteered at the Willowhaven Park Nature Center Earth Day event. During the event there was a grand opening for the new arboretum trail, a rubbish collection activity and a children's gardening program.

At Waltham, Massachusetts, CSL Seqirus ran a photo contest to celebrate environmental consciousness, sustainability and preservation. Photos of nature, conservation efforts and environmental activism were encouraged. The final winner was selected based on photos demonstrating the impacts of litter and garbage on local wildlife.

# Environmental trends

Compared with the prior year, total Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduced as CSL moved to increase the proportion of purchased electricity from renewable sources in Europe. This is notwithstanding the acquisition of CSL Vifor and increased production volumes at some locations. There were modest increases across energy and water consumption, with total waste and the proportion of waste recycled also increasing. This upward trend results from the addition of CSL Vifor and the waste solvent generated at that facility, as well as waste solvent from CSL Behring sites, which is subsequently recycled either onsite or offsite.

Our environmental performance includes data from the following operations:

- CSL Seqirus, three manufacturing facilities – Australia, the UK and the United States;  
- CSL Behring, five manufacturing facilities – Australia, Germany, Switzerland, the United States and China;  
- CSL Vifor, one manufacturing facility – Switzerland;  
- CSL Plasma operations, including plasma centres, across China, Germany, Hungary and the United States and two major plasma logistics centres, CSL Plasma laboratory and CSL Plasma's saline manufacturing facility also in the United States;  
- administrative and R&D operations co-located with our manufacturing facilities; and  
- the respective head offices for CSL Behring (King of Prussia, United States), CSL Plasma (Boca Raton, United States) and CSL Limited (Parkville, Australia).

This year we have also sought limited assurance on energy consumption and emissions data, including baseline data used for the establishment of our emissions reduction targets.

1 Data reported are inclusive of CSL Behring and CSL Seqirus manufacturing facilities, CSL Plasma network and CSL Behring headquarters.  
2 CSL Plasma uses validated factors to calculate electrical power, gas and water consumption. Utility invoices were used to establish these factors and calculate natural gas, electricity and water consumption for all CSL Plasma centres. Utility invoices were also used for CSL Plasma Logistic centres, CSL Plasma Laboratories and the Union manufacturing facility (United States). CSL Plasma uses the contracted waste hauler monthly data to calculate the total yearly waste impact. In the absence of hauler information, a factorial is applied to calculate the estimated waste impact per volume of plasma collected.  
3 Includes CSL Vifor manufacturing facility in Switzerland following acquisition in August 2022.  
4 The majority of greenhouse gas (GHG) emitted from CSL's operation is carbon dioxide  $(\mathrm{CO}_{2})$ . In most jurisdictions GHG emission factors used by CSL calculate carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane emissions. Total emissions are expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents  $(\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ -e).  
5 Includes Scope 1 and 2 energy sources. Scope 1 energy sources are fossil energy sources supplied or used onsite, including fleet fuel use. Scope 2 energy sources are electricity and steam supplied to site, as well as chilled water and compressed air.  
6 The recycling rate represents the proportion of total waste generated that is either reused or recycled onsite or offsite.

* Limited assurance by Ernst & Young.

# CSL's Scope 1 and 2 emissions profile

Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions are direct emissions from CSL activities. CSL's Scope 1 emissions primarily come from the combustion of fossil fuels. The greatest proportion of these emissions come from burning natural gas to generate steam at manufacturing facilities. Scope 2 emission are from purchased electricity and to a lesser extent purchased steam, cooling water and compressed air. Manufacturing sites in Germany, Switzerland and the UK currently purchase electricity specifically from renewable sources. In 2022/23,  $17\%$  of the electricity purchased by CSL was from renewable sources.

# Energy and emissions

The main sources of energy for CSL's manufacturing facilities are electricity and natural gas. Steam is imported to our Wuhan, China, and Marburg, Germany, facilities as an energy source. Chilled water and compressed air are also supplied to the Marburg facility. Small amounts of diesel, gasoline and heating oil are also used as energy sources. For our CSL Plasma network of centres, electricity is the main source of energy. Combined, our manufacturing facilities and CSL Plasma's centres contribute most of CSL's energy consumption and therefore greenhouse gas emissions.

In August 2022, CSL announced emissions reduction targets that aim to serve as a tangible and transparent roadmap by reducing its direct and indirect emissions footprint.

By 2030, CSL aims to:

- target a reduction of  $40\%$  of absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions against a baseline of the average annual emissions across fiscal years 2019–2021; and  
- engage with suppliers who contribute  $67\%$  of Scope 3 emissions to set Scope 1 and 2 reduction targets, aligned with science-based targets.

To further demonstrate our commitment to minimising our impact on climate change, in June 2023, CSL committed to set near-term company-wide emissions reductions in line with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), paving the way for the validation of our contribution towards minimising global temperature increases to  $1.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .

# New headquarters achieves green design certification

In September 2022, the Green Building Council of Australia certified CSL's new Global Headquarters and Centre for R&D in Melbourne with a 5-star rating under its Green Star rating system. This design certification signifies that our new global headquarters represents 'Australian excellence' in environmentally sustainable building practices.

The Green Star rating is an internationally recognised system for setting the standard for healthy, resilient, positive buildings and places, and rewards buildings that reduce the impact of climate change, enhance health and quality of life, and contribute to maintaining a sustainable economy.

Some of the sustainability features that helped achieve the 5-star certification include:

- sourcing of building materials from responsible manufacturers;  
recycling of building materials and diverting of construction waste from landfill;  
- electrical vehicle charging stations available in the car park;  
- optimised building insulation and glazing to reduce heating and cooling loads;  
- facade designed to reduce the need for artificial lighting;  
- highly efficient lifts with regenerative braking;  
- water-efficient bathroom facilities and irrigation systems; and  
- flicker-free lighting, and the minimisation of glare through windows.

CSL is aiming to obtain a 5-star Green Star as Built rating to validate the sustainability credentials of our new global headquarters post occupation.

# Supplier engagement on CSL's Scope 3 emissions

Last year, CSL announced its intention to engage suppliers who contribute  $67\%$  of its Scope 3 emissions to set science-based targets aligned Scope 1 and 2 reductions by 2030.

In support of achieving this target, CSL has developed a dedicated supplier engagement program to firstly identify suppliers who have set or are planning to set science-based targets and secondly, to educate and partner with suppliers who have not set targets to support them on their emissions reduction journey.

In late 2022, CSL initiated the first wave of communication targeting a small number of suppliers. All suppliers targeted in this first wave, representing  $8\%$  of CSL's total Scope 3 emissions (as at 30 June 2022) have set or plan to set science-based targets, by 2024. We have already initiated wave two of supplier engagement, targeting 72 suppliers. We anticipate communicating with more than 400 suppliers by the end of financial year 2024.

Each year CSL aims to recalculate our Scope 3 baseline to understand our total Scope 3 emissions profile and adjust our supplier engagement strategy to target strategic, ongoing suppliers. Furthermore, we aim to validate supplier data sets utilising the SBTi dashboard and CDP's annual climate change questionnaire. For more than 10 years CSL has participated in annual CDP climate change and water submissions and aims to encourage suppliers to do the same via CDP Supply Chain.

# CSL Vifor incentivising employee mobility to reduce emissions

Apart from industrial manufacturing processes and the use of office buildings, employee mobility also generates greenhouse gas emissions, either through business travel or commuting. Internal data at CSL Vifor suggested that, over the last years, the emissions caused by business travel and commuting by employees from our manufacturing operations and associated offices was roughly equivalent to the total emissions generated by the manufacturing facility alone.

In response to these findings, CSL Vifor took a targeted approach to better manage its business travels and introduced a range of measures to reduce the number of work-related flights. This includes continuous investments in video conferencing technology, stricter flight approval rules, streamlining the internal flight management system and the use of climate-focused analytical tools.

Additionally, to encourage employees to rethink how they are coming to work every day, St Gallen, Switzerland, introduced several initiatives geared towards environment-friendly transportation and commuting solutions. These include an app-based car sharing platform (Comovee), an annual Bike-to-Work month, a shuttle service from the site to the train station, or e-bike discounts to employees.

In 2022, all St Gallen-based employees were offered a two-week trial subscription for public transportation to reassess their commuting habits. More than 50 employees participated in this initiative. A follow-up program is already planned.

These measures are a step in the right direction towards supporting achievement of CSL's environmental objectives.

# Climate change and resilience

Climate change affects all aspects of businesses and communities, both directly and indirectly, with the severity varying significantly by region. A warming planet increases the risk of wildfires, rising sea levels, extreme heat, severe weather and droughts. These hazards can have a direct effect on population health and further stress healthcare infrastructure, including the network of global manufacturing facilities and warehouses used by CSL in the production of life-saving medicines and therapies.

CSL has taken actions to proactively mitigate and adapt to climate change. Recent efforts include undertaking an enterprise-wide climate risk and opportunity assessment in 2022 using the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (IPCC AR6) across our most critical infrastructure: our manufacturing

facilities and warehouses. The assessment focused on a near-term time horizon of 2030, in line with CSL's 2030 Strategy.

CSL has assessed the impact of climate risk on its financial reporting. The impact assessment principally focuses on key judgement areas, being the valuation and useful lives of intangible and tangible assets and the identification and valuation of provisions and contingent liabilities. No material accounting impacts or changes to judgements or other required disclosures have resulted from the assessment. While the assessment did not have a material impact for the year ended 30 June 2023, this may change in future periods as CSL regularly updates its assessment of the impact of the lower carbon economy.

Over the reporting period, CSL has also commenced the integration of physical risks into existing operational risk management practices in accordance with the Enterprise Risk Management Framework, so that the facilities can monitor and manage risks as applicable to their location and operations. For transitional risks, rather than managing these at the local level, we have taken an enterprise view as these risks generally span the network of facilities directly owned by CSL.

This year CSL also published an updated Climate Change Statement, reaffirming our aim to reduce emissions to limit global warming to  $1.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  in line with the Paris Agreement.

You can find more information on the approach, including scenario analysis undertaken in 2022, on CSL.com (Sustainability > Environment > Climate resilience).

# Waste and packaging

CSL's objective is to reduce the amount of waste that is generated throughout the production and use of all products; to reuse and recycle waste as far as possible; and to dispose of the residual waste responsibly. The amount of waste produced and how it is handled varies between CSL's different facilities according to production processes and available disposal options. Compared with the prior year, our waste recycling rate increased by  $6\%$  to  $44\%$  of total waste.

A large part of the waste stream is made up of glass, plastics, cardboard, wooden pallets and other types of packaging, which is necessary for ensuring product safety of

pharmaceuticals. Disposal of packaging presents particular challenges for pharmaceutical companies because packaging such as single-use plastics, glass syringes and vials that must be disposed of in a safe manner.

CSL's operations in Europe dispose of almost all waste by recycling or incineration. In Australia, CSL is a signatory to the Australian Packaging Covenant and reports regularly on plans and progress to minimise waste. There is also a wide variety of waste recycling programs at our United States facilities. However, more can be done to reduce waste to landfill across our Australian and United States operations and this remains a focus area for CSL in the near-term.

CSL is continuing to identify and implement methods to reduce the amount of materials used for the packaging and distribution of its products as detailed following.

- The new function, Packaging Innovation, is dedicated to evaluating and planning the introduction of sustainable materials.  
- The use of sustainable materials in packaging development is prescribed in our procedures.  
- Size reduction of current packaging is also taken into consideration when current packs are adapted.  
- Paper patient information leaflets have now been completely removed for our Behring products on the Japanese market. The leaflet removal will now continue for other markets and products from the whole of the CSL organisation.

# Ethanol recovery by distillation

The case of the ethanol recovery by distillation program at CSL Behring, Broadmeadows, Australia, is a sustainability win on various fronts. It's a compelling example of:

- collaboration to leverage expertise and lessons learned among CSL manufacturing sites across the globe – Australia, China, Switzerland and the United States – to achieve the successful deployment of a replicable solution;  
improving economic efficiencies; and  
- achieving significant waste reduction.

It reveals how global collaboration can make difficult problems much easier to tackle and solve. It also showcases CSL's commitment to identifying and directly addressing and reducing environmental impacts through a reduction of natural resource usage and of emissions from truck deliveries.

Engineers at CSL Behring Broadmeadows, Australia, collaborated with sites in Switzerland and the United States and built upon their collective design and operational experience because these sites already performed ethanol recovery. Ethanol is a critical agent used in the plasma fractionation process. After separation of proteins from the blood plasma, a waste solution containing large amounts of ethanol remains. The distillation process uses a column, reboiler and condenser to recover ethanol from the waste solution.

![](images/e8a445a49b707aeb8b0ad4bc4b5c806949f4a7513ce89189a08f0a2750b05155.jpg)

The recycling of recovered ethanol also reduces consumption of raw materials required for ethanol production. It has also led to a significant increase in economic efficiencies and a reduction in emissions from transportation deliveries.

Overall, ethanol recovery at rates  $\geq 90\%$  help achieve the following benefits:

- reduction of trucks traveling to the site: eliminated more than 270 truck movements to/from site per year;  
- reduction in waste ( $\sim$ 9,500 t. of liquid industrial waste per year); and  
- a reduction of over 140,000 kms of truck movements on roads per year.

# Our greatest opportunity to contribute to society is through the development of new therapies for serious unmet medical needs and through the continued supply of life-saving vaccines and plasma and protein-based therapies.

From developing new, innovative therapies for diseases to enabling greater access to life-saving vaccines, protecting the safety and wellbeing of our patients and communities around the world is at the centre of our purpose as a business. This includes a commitment to a positive experience and the trust of our donors, who make vital therapies possible, and to continuous engagement with the stakeholders we depend upon to fulfill our promise.

In addition to material topics featured, our strategic sustainability focus areas include:

- strengthening societal health through access to our existing products and therapies and investment in innovation;

# Product safety and quality

The development, manufacture and supply of high-quality and safe products is critical to CSL's ability to continue to protect public health, save lives and improve the health and wellbeing of patients with rare and serious diseases. CSL employs an independent quality function that strives to maintain the highest standards through the use of global quality standards and systems. These are reflected in global policies and global and local procedures, as well as global electronic systems to support management of the quality processes.

In 2022/23, CSL's quality systems, plasma collection and manufacturing operations were subject to 473 regulatory agency inspections around the world. Of these, 21 good manufacturing practice (GMP) regulatory agency inspections took place at our manufacturing facilities and 452 regulatory inspections at our plasma collection centres. These 473 independent inspections resulted in no critical findings that prevented release of commercial product and no suspensions or terminations of licenses to market any products in markets in which CSL is active.* These results confirm that the quality systems established globally by CSL are effective and in line with regulatory agency expectations.

In November 2022, as a precautionary measure, one CSL Behring lot of PRIVIGEN® was recalled from the Canadian market due to a higher rate of allergic/hypersensitivity type reactions.* Hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions are a known risk with immunoglobulin products. In June 2023, CSL Behring, in coordination with local health authorities, initiated a recall of one batch of CSL Behring product from the Czech and Saudi Arabian markets due to a media fill failure*. In June 2023, one CSL Seqirus lot of Tiger Snake Antivenom was recalled from the Australian market due to a slightly lower out of specification result for potency*.

This year, there were 11 counterfeit products reported to and confirmed by CSL Behring. CSL Behring is evaluating opportunities to increase the security of packaging solutions

to prevent counterfeiting. In addition, CSL Behring is working with health authorities to raise awareness and educate customers on how to identify, handle and report suspected counterfeit products.

During the fiscal year, CSL commenced the integration of CSL Vifor into the CSL Group. From a quality perspective, CSL Vifor is in the process of being integrated into the CSL Quality Management System whilst upholding a full functioning and compliant system in the CSL Vifor business. Over the reporting period, CSL Vifor was subject to two GMP regulatory agency inspections with no critical findings that prevented release of commercial product, no suspensions or terminations of licenses to market any products in markets in which CSL Vifor is active.*

![](images/cd9770dd99114af13f2d0a8d6605a9d212e10c39666336467f57c06c4cc16bc8.jpg)

regulatory inspections resulted in no critical findings that prevented release of commercial product, no suspensions or terminations of licenses to market any products in markets in which CSL is active.*

In addition, over the financial year, CSL Behring and CSL Seqirus pharmacovigilance and regulatory quality assurance (PVRQA) performed a total of 91 pharmacovigilance (PV) audits:

- 23 on internal systems and processes across our sites, including affiliates; and  
- 68 on third parties that undertake PV responsibilities on CSL's behalf in various countries all over the world.

None of these audits resulted in an outcome which affected CSL's ability to supply product.

CSL Behring underwent several good manufacturing practice inspections which focused on patient safety and pharmacovigilance. None of these inspections resulted in an outcome which affected patient safety or resulted in critical findings.

# Supply continuity and resilience, including human rights and responsible supply chain

CSL has a standardised global approach to managing supplier qualification to ensure the high quality of purchased  $\mathsf{GxP}^{\wedge}$  materials and services as well as ensuring quality oversight of outsourced activities. To assure continued consistent high-quality materials from our partners, CSL collaborates and partners with critical suppliers and routinely conducts quality audits worldwide.

The continued growth of partner-delivered commercial manufacturing services to CSL necessitated the establishment of a formal leadership capability. CSL has put in place a cross-functional External Plant Leadership Team that mirrors the capability of an internal CSL site in order to deliver the same high quality and reliable product supply to the network. Several new partnerships entered the commercial supply phase, such as our leading gene therapy HEMGENIX®, which continues CSL's strategy to leverage top-tier strategic partnerships and spread single-sourced product supply risks over multiple manufacturers. These partnerships also deliver greater capacity to support CSL's growth plans.

Many projects continue in various stages of the technology transfer and when delivered will further increase supply reliability, needed capacity and resilience of CSL's most important product supply chains.

Over the reporting period, CSL continued to evolve its third-party risk management (TPRM) digital tool by means of additional questions for environment health and safety and supply chain legislation screening, and a wider use of the industry recognised EcoVadis tool for environmental vendor assessments.

CSL has significantly accelerated the use of the TPRM tool and have now loaded 883 vendors over the reporting period. The on-boarding process has also started of CSL's most critical incumbent vendors, none of whom is categorised as high risk.

CSL has also implemented a vendor program to address CSL's Scope 3 requirements and have made good progress towards our goals.

We continue to refine our tools and this level of effort reflects our focus on understanding our suppliers and our commitment to enabling a reliable supply of our therapies.

In December 2022, CSL's third, Board-approved, public Modern Slavery Statement under Australian law and was published on CSL's website and by the Australian regulator. CSL continues its membership of the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI), which provides opportunity to collaborate with like-minded organisations across a number of social and environmental aspects, including human rights and labour practices.

Anyone with information about potential misconduct is encouraged to 'Speak Up' under the CSL Speak Up Policy. This includes all of CSL's current and past employees, directors, contractors, customers, suppliers and associates. All reports made under this policy are received and treated sensitively and seriously, and dealt with promptly, fairly and objectively.

From 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2023, no reports related to human trafficking or slavery and forced labour in CSL's global operations were received.

$\wedge$ GxP refers to a number of good practice standards applicable to the pharmaceutical industry.

Further, in December 2022, CSL published a standalone Human Rights Statement. The Statement, which builds on human rights elements detailed in our Code of Responsible Business Practice, was communicated to employees on World Day for Safety and Health at Work – a United Nations day of observance (28 April 2023).

You can find CSL's Human Rights Statement and modern slavery response on CSL.com (Sustainability > Social).

# Health security

A measure of the trust CSL has built with its stakeholders is our position as a global leader in influenza pandemic preparedness and response. Thirty countries around the world rely on CSL Seqirus for pandemic influenza preparedness, including the United States, the UK and Australia. CSL also provides pandemic response commitments to the World Health Organization.

CSL Seqirus has state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities on three different continents, together with a global fill and finish network located close to end markets. Our government partners reserve pandemic vaccine doses from these facilities to protect their populations in the event of an influenza pandemic. CSL Seqirus also supplies pre-pandemic vaccine stockpiles that could be deployed to first-responders upon a declaration of an influenza pandemic.

In 2022/23, there were increased reports of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infections in wild birds, poultry and some mammal populations around the world, leading to frequent engagement with our government partners about the emerging epidemiology, our licensed H5N1 vaccine, and our ability to manufacture and distribute with speed because of our global seasonal influenza vaccine throughput.

To further enhance the ability to protect public health, CSL Seqirus entered into a five-year partnership with Pandemic Institute in Liverpool, UK, which will deliver on a number of joint projects, such as modelling the spread and impact of avian influenza ahead of a potential pandemic.

# Access to our products

CSL products provide substantial and meaningful value to patients, healthcare providers, health insurance payers and healthcare systems around the world.

CSL is proud of these contributions and seeks to ensure that patients and communities have access to a reliable supply of biopharmaceuticals and vaccines.

As CSL continues to develop and commercialise biopharmaceutical innovations which evolve the treatment paradigm, such as gene therapy, we are committed to working with governments, payers, and other stakeholders to design new payment and access solutions that reflect value and that meet the needs of individual patients and healthcare systems. CSL also continue to work with governments, health insurance payers and other stakeholders to support timely and appropriate market entry and access, to enable patients to benefit from our therapies as quickly as possible. We value an ongoing dialogue with policymakers, advocacy groups, and other stakeholders to understand and respond to their needs and expectations.

We articulate and communicate comprehensive evidence on the value of our innovations to inform access and reimbursement decisions, and we provide patient assistance programs and support advocacy efforts that improve access to care and affordability.

In 2022/23, CSL's investment in humanitarian access programs and product support initiatives totalled US$13.7 million.* In the United States, access programs are critical to patients who are uninsured, underinsured or who cannot afford therapy.

As a member of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (IFPMA), CSL Seqirus contributed to the development of the Berlin Declaration, which draws on the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic and sets out an approach for more equitable pandemic preparedness and response and calls for contributions from a global collaboration of public, private and charitable sectors together with civil society.

The Berlin Declaration is being used in discussions with WHO and Member States as they negotiate a new Pandemic Accord and describes key enablers to equitable access across low-, middle- and high-income countries, including respect for intellectual property rights, robust surveillance and rapid sharing of pathogens, regulatory speed, country readiness and maintaining open borders.

# Improving access in developing countries for patients with bleeding disorders

In support of our focus areas for improved access to our therapies, last year, CSL Behring announced a significant new partnership with the World Federation of Haemophilia (WFH).

In 2023, CSL began its five-year commitment to donating 100 million international units (IUs) of coagulation factor therapy per year for five years to the WFH as part of CSL's continued support of the WFH Humanitarian Aid Program. The donation, which includes product specifically manufactured for the purposes of being donated, will have a standard shelf life of three years, enabling greater access to these life-saving therapies for people around the world.

In January 2023, CSL Behring initiated the first of two deliveries of 50 million IUs to the WFH. The donation is destined to help people living with a bleeding disorder (haemophilia A) in more than 60 developing countries. In addition to the product donation, CSL Behring provided financial support for logistics costs and training programs designed to address unmet needs for people living with haemophilia who are undiagnosed, untreated or undertreated.

CSL Behring's contributions to the WFH Humanitarian Aid program make life-changing improvement to people with no access to care for bleeding disorders. For example, CSL Behring's 2022 WFH Stewardship Report outlines the following impact (data based on donations received in calendar year 2022, prior to commencement of CSL's new five-year commitment):

# The role of real-world evidence in driving vaccine value and access

The influenza virus can change significantly each year, making it critical for CSL Seqirus to assess seasonal vaccine effectiveness through real world evidence (RWE), year after year.

As a company on the front line of influenza prevention, CSL Seqirus is committed to using RWE to continually evaluate the clinical benefit and cost effectiveness of our innovative seasonal influenza vaccines compared to more traditional options. RWE can be a valuable tool in helping health agencies make decisions about which influenza vaccines to recommend for certain populations, providing access for the most vulnerable groups through government-funded immunisation programs.

In October 2022, CSL Seqirus undertook a modelling study using RWE to understand the impact of co-circulation of influenza and COVID-19 on healthcare resources in the winter months in the UK. The study, now published, is helping governments understand the pressures their healthcare systems will be placed under and the broader value of robust immunisation program as we learn to adjust to this new reality.

In March 2023, CSL Seqirus partnered with a member of the European Parliament to produce a multistakeholder symposium at the European Parliament entitled 'Better Decision-Making for Better Outcomes: Harnessing the Power of RWE' at which a European Union-wide call to action for more systematic use of RWE by policy makers, regulators and payers was launched.

# CSL Vifor's commitment to patients through the Patient Academy

The CSL Vifor Patient Academy offers employees the unique opportunity to learn directly from patient representatives about the disease burden they carry and the importance of involving patients' insights in key strategic decisions from clinical development programs to the development of patient support programs. When engaging directly with patients, we follow strict engagement protocols and apply standardised remuneration principles. Patient safety is a top priority. We have strict drug safety and reporting processes in place, ensuring that patients using our products benefit safely from them. Scientific activities are performed in a patient-centric manner and according to internationally established standards.

In its fourth year, the CSL Vifor Patient Academy continued to evolve in 2022. It includes:

35 patient ambassadors who participated in numerous events and provided input into internal processes;  
- five global educational events that were organised throughout the past year with patient involvement focusing on nephrology, heart failure, rare disease and iron deficiency to raise awareness amongst employees;  
- two digital campaigns sponsored by CSL Vifor in 2022 for Rare Revolution Magazine to increase understanding of the burden of disease for IgAN and vasculitis; and  
- seven roundtables with heart failure patients working groups from across Europe organised by the Patient Academy.

Under the umbrella of the Academy, a whitepaper entitled 'Heart Failure, an inconvenient truth' was published in September 2022 with the aim to advocate for a better quality of life in heart failure. This whitepaper is based on a pan-European survey among more than 600 heart failure patients and has been developed together with the following stakeholder groups: CSL Vifor, Pumping Marvellous (UK), AVEC (France), Herzschwäche Deutschland (Germany), and The Patients Voice (Netherlands) and Vintura (Netherlands). For this project, CSL Vifor was awarded SILVER by the Patient Partnership Index 2022.

# Plasma donors

People who donate plasma at one of the 342 CSL Plasma centres around the world are the real heroes. They allow tens of thousands of people worldwide to live normal, healthy lives – despite being impacted by rare and serious medical conditions.

As one of the world's largest producers of plasma-derived therapies and a leader in plasma collection, CSL Plasma commits to excellence and innovation across the full cycle of plasma donation, from donor screening throughout the donation process and across plasma testing and logistics. About 15,000 CSL Plasma employees take responsibility for ensuring safe, quality plasma is available to be manufactured into life-saving therapies.

CSL has strengthened and grown its plasma collection footprint to support a safe and positive donor experience, while providing a reliable plasma supply as the needs of patients who require these therapies have increased. Appropriate donor screening and safe, compliant and efficient plasma collection both remain integral to a continuous quality supply of the starting material for the manufacture of plasma-derived therapies.

Not only does each CSL Plasma centre provide plasma as the foundation of life-saving and life-enhancing therapies, they also contribute positively to local communities, supporting donors and benefitting the surrounding area. For a third year, CSL Plasma provided vouchers to United States plasma donors for influenza vaccines at a local pharmacy at no cost during the United States autumn and winter seasons. A mature centre that has operated for more than three years provides approximately 50 jobs, of which a majority are full-time, and contributes nearly US$6 million per centre in employee payroll and donor payments.

CSL Plasma began implementation of the new Rika Plasma Donation System in August 2022 as part of a limited market release at centres starting in the Denver area in the United States, with plans to continue rollout of the device to other United States locations. Developed by Terumo Blood and Cell Technologies, the Rika system achieved regulatory clearance with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2022.

In May 2023, CSL began working with Terumo on the clinical trial to evaluate an investigational individualised nomogram; a nomogram is the target collection volume the device is approved to for each procedure. Upon regulatory clearance, the new nomogram can be used with the Rika system.

The Rika system supports a safe, efficient and improved experience for plasma donors and an improved employee experience including the features detailed below.

- It completes one plasma collection in 35 minutes or less on average. When considering prior average CSL Plasma donation times, this could represent a nearly  $30\%$  reduction in average donation time for donors.  
- There is not more than 200 millilitres of blood outside the donor's body at one time. This is expected to improve the donor's comfort during the donation and reduce occurrence of a red cell loss deferral.

It is designed with an advanced user interface to guide CSL Plasma front-line operators, as well as status indicators that inform donors and employees of donation progress.

# CSL Plasma donor experience and profile

The socio-demographic background of United States CSL Plasma donors remains diverse. Based on self-reported survey data administered through the newly deployed CSL Plasma mobile app (1 July 2022 to 30 June 2023), CSL Plasma donors provided details on their occupational status:*

-  $55\%$  described themselves as working full-time.  
-  $19\%$  described themselves as unemployed, inclusive of full-time parents, donors who are not looking for work or the unemployed.  
-  $15\%$  described themselves as part-time.  
-  $3\%$  described themselves as students.  
-  $8\%$  described themselves as other (e.g. military, retired).

Of those plasma donors surveyed,  $94\%$  are willing to donate again, and  $91\%$  of plasma donors are willing to refer a friend to donate plasma at their CSL Plasma centre.\*

* Limited assurance by Ernst & Young. CSL Plasma updated post-donation survey questions in September 2021 to use a Likert response scale from a prior yes or no answer. Data is based on 3.5 million survey responses. The percentages for willing to donate and refer a friend are comprised of total number of respondents who selected the top two (4 and 5) of five numbers on the Likert scale.

# Focusing on the safety of plasma donors

Our ability to supply life-enhancing and often life-saving therapies is only made possible by ensuring a safe, quality and positive donor experience. All CSL Plasma centres operate to the highest standards for the management and care of plasma donors.

CSL Plasma continues several strategies to reduce donor adverse events (AEs), including an initiative to support plasma donor hydration at all United States centres in which donors can access water, juice and snacks before or after the plasma donation procedure. Our focus remains to minimise overall AEs, especially among first-time donors. We have enhanced training for phlebotomy and medical staff associate roles across the collection centre network. We have also increased proactive donor education through traditional and digital channels to support donation and healthier lifestyles.

# Social investment

CSL's approach to community support is guided by our Code of Responsible Business Practice and supplemented by our Global Community Contributions Policy. The policy applies to all CSL businesses and employees and is intended to be implemented to guide decision making and management of any form of community contribution, financial or by other means. The core of the policy is our community contributions framework, which sets out our key focus areas of support: patient communities, innovation and science and local communities. In 2022/23, CSL contributed US$42.6 million to support global efforts where we operate.

# Together, CSL and employees support Turkey and Syria relief efforts

In February 2023, a catastrophic earthquake struck the border of Turkey and Syria, the deadliest to hit the region in more than two decades. Tens of thousands of lives were lost, and many more people were left in need of medical services and humanitarian aid. To support relief efforts, and in keeping with our promise to human health, CSL and employees together contributed A$351,752 to humanitarian organisations. Of that amount, which includes employee receipt matching, more than A$290,000 was donated to the Emergency Action Alliance in Australia – a coalition of 15 humanitarian relief charities.

Further, CSL affiliates in the region undertook a critical product donation of 5,000 IUs of TETAGAM® (Tetanus immunoglobulin) to local authorities to support healthcare needs as extensive rebuilding efforts continue.

# CSL's support of the Australian medical research ecosystem

CSL's support of the Australian medical research ecosystem spans long term and committed sponsorships of programs and initiatives that help foster the next generation of medical researchers through to advancing knowledge in medical and scientific communities.

The CSL Centenary Fellowships are high-value, long-term, competitively selected grants available to outstanding midcareer scientists seeking to undertake discovery and translational medical research in Australia. Dr Samuel Forster of Hudson Medical Research Institute was awarded a 2023 CSL Centenary Fellowship for his pioneering work investigating the causes of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and treatment design.

Dr Forster may have taken a different career path into IT had it not been for a fortuitous placement with CSIRO's Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP), which he undertook when he was completing his undergraduate degrees in Information Systems and Science at Melbourne University. UROP was an opportunity for Dr Forster to experience medical research and meet world-leading scientists working to gain knowledge, solve problems and find better ways to treat disease.

UROP serves as an entry point to research for those who may never have considered research as a career. Through my UROP placement, I became aware of the opportunities a research career presented.

![](images/be0e8393f6c8b9489413e042fe39886d22feb20fa357edb8cb005d84f3035261.jpg)

CSL has been the major sponsor of UROP since its establishment over ten years ago which facilitates research placements for undergraduate students across research organisations, industry and universities in Victoria. CSL is proud to support budding scientists at critical decision-making points in their academic careers as well as those who are pioneering their fields of scientific discovery.

CSL maintains high standards of corporate governance as part of the Board and the management team's commitment to maximise shareholder value. This is achieved through promoting effective strategic planning, risk management, transparency and corporate responsibility.

# Governance structure

CSL's approach to corporate governance and the role it plays goes well beyond meeting our compliance obligations.

CSL believes that its governance framework fosters a high performing and respectful culture while underpinning CSL's Values. The Board has a formal charter documenting its membership, operating procedures and the allocation of responsibilities between the Board and management. CSL's Board Charter is central to the governance framework at CSL as it embodies our corporate purpose, strategy and values. In addition to this, CSL is subject to the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Act 1961 (Cth), which is an overarching governance control.

CSL's Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing the management of CSL and providing strategic direction. It monitors operational and financial performance, strategic human resource matters and approves CSL's budgets and business plans. It is also responsible for overseeing CSL's risk management framework, compliance system and internal control framework, and approving statutory financial reports.

The Board has delegated the day-to-day management of CSL, and the implementation of approved business plans and strategies, to the CEO and Managing Director, who in turn further delegates (as appropriate) to senior management.

The following diagram shows the governance framework of CSL. Robust processes are in place to ensure the delegation flows through the Board and its committees to the CEO and Managing Director, the Global Leadership Group (GLG) and into the organisation. The CEO and Managing Director and GLG have responsibility for the day-to-day management of the Group. This governance framework also aligns the flow of information and accountability from our people, through the management levels, to the Board and ultimately our shareholders and key stakeholders.

# Board composition

Throughout the year there was a maximum of ten directors on the Board. At the date of this report, there are nine directors on the Board, comprising seven independent non-executive directors, one non-independent non-executive director and one executive director.

# Ethics and transparency

While CSL's Values serve as its directional compass, the Code of Responsible Business Practice (Code) provides a more detailed map to deliver on our promise to patients and public health by exemplifying high standards of conduct throughout the organisation.

CSL's Code aims to foster a culture that rewards high ethical standards, personal and corporate integrity and respect for others.

All employees undertake training on the Code and CSL's new ethics-based decision making tool. These two e-learning modules have been made available in 14 languages to cater for CSL's global workforce.

In certain aspects of CSL's business, such as the marketing of our products, our relationships with healthcare professionals or healthcare organisations and our research and development, we have made further commitments to comply with both local and internationally accepted pharmaceutical industry codes of conduct.

CSL expects its third party partners to comply with the applicable local laws and regulations of the countries in which they operate, and to observe all of the principles set out in our Third Party Code of Conduct.

We have internal control systems to ensure financial statements comply with the applicable local laws of the countries in which we operate and to prevent fraud and other improper conduct.

CSL's Code of Responsible Business Practice as well as Third Party Code of Conduct can be found on CSL.com (We Are CSL > Corporate Governance > Code of Responsible Business Practice).

# Anti-bribery and anti-corruption

CSL has an Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy that prohibits CSL businesses and employees from directly or indirectly offering, paying, soliciting or accepting bribes or giving or receiving personal favours, financial or other rewards or inducements in exchange for making business decisions. This prohibition applies regardless of the value of the reward or inducement. CSL policy also prohibits facilitation payments. The Board, via the ARMC, periodically receives information regarding material breaches of the Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy as a way of maintaining oversight.

CSL operates in a diverse and complex marketplace and has a number of commercial arrangements with governments and related agencies across various geographies. Bribery and corruption are risks that could expose the organisation and employees to possible prosecution, fines and imprisonment.

Market practices are governed by company-specific policies and procedures. Internal compliance mechanisms and control systems are directly supported by our Global Ethics and Compliance team and subject to additional oversight by CSL's Global Compliance Committee, regional committees, and CSL's Audit and Risk Management Committee of the Board.

Based on these controls, CSL considers its overall risk relating to corruption to be low and is committed to complying with laws and regulations in the regions in which CSL operates and those that CSL seeks to enter.

CSL has a Group Speak Up Policy to encourage anyone to raise concerns about potential misconduct, including in relation to bribery or corruption. CSL staff may raise any concerns internally. Additionally, anyone can make anonymous reports to the Speak Up Hotline, an independent and confidential reporting line available globally.

In addition, over the reporting period, an annual assessment of bribery and corruption risk was conducted by the Ethics & Compliance teams. The assessment included asking a cross-section of employees in CSL's commercial and manufacturing operations to complete a standardised questionnaire. The questionnaire is designed to assist with identifying practices or behaviours that could be in breach of CSL's Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy. Results are provided to the Global Compliance Committee and regional/ local compliance committees for review, and the committees may ask for actions to be taken which could include: to revise regional or local policies or procedures; to deliver further training; for ongoing monitoring; or for a more detailed assessment of the local commercial operation, including any third parties acting on behalf of CSL. The implementation of the committee's review and actions are supported by the local, regional and global Ethics and Compliance teams.

# Political contributions

Over the reporting period, CSL contributed a total of US$1,000 in non-cash corporate political contributions in the United States and A$5,500 to political organisations in Australia solely for attendance at events including policy briefings, lunches, boardroom lunches and dinners.

More at CSL.com (Sustainability > Governance).

# Disclosure

As a publicly listed company on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), CSL has obligations under Australian law and the ASX Listing Rules. Subject to limited exceptions, CSL must continuously disclose to the ASX information about CSL that a reasonable person would expect to have a material effect on the price or value of CSL securities.

CSL has a policy that sets clear guidelines and describes the actions that the directors and all employees should take when they become aware of information that may require disclosure. CSL's Continuous Disclosure Policy can be found on CSL.com (We Are CSL > Corporate Governance > Core Policies).

# Corporate governance

Throughout 2022/23, CSL's governance arrangements were consistent with the ASX Corporate Governance Council's Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations (4th edition). Our 2022/23 Corporate Governance Statement has been approved by the Board and is available on CSL.com (We Are CSL > Corporate Governance).

The Board continually reviews governance at CSL to ensure that the governance framework remains appropriate in light of changing expectations and general developments in good corporate governance.

# Risk management

CSL has adopted and follows a detailed and structured Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF) to ensure that risks are identified, evaluated, monitored and managed. This ERMF sets out the risk management processes, internal compliance and monitoring requirements, governance processes and structures including roles and responsibilities for different levels of management, the matrix of risk impact and likelihood for assessing risk, the three lines of accountability for risk and risk management reporting requirements.

The ERMF has been established to provide reasonable assurance that:

- any material exposure to risk can be identified and adequately monitored and managed; and  
- significant strategic, emerging, financial, managerial and operating risk-related information is accurate, relevant, timely and reliable.

Further details of CSL's risk management framework are contained in CSL's Corporate Governance Statement.

A description of CSL's material risks and key risk management activities for each risk can be found in CSL's Material Risks on page 26 of this report.

# Tax transparency

While CSL's roots are proudly Australian, CSL is a truly global company, with more than  $90\%$  of revenue derived outside Australia. We separately report on our global tax footprint, as part of CSL's tax transparency reporting.

We are subject to the different tax regimes that apply in each of those countries and apply the applicable taxation laws in all the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the OECD Country-by-Country reporting measures.

CSL's approach to tax is underpinned by our Value of Integrity. This is consistent with our commitment to complying with all tax laws in the countries in which we operate. CSL has a low appetite for tax risk and does not engage in aggressive tax planning.

CSL supports efforts to improve tax transparency in order to support a fairer economy and ensure there is confidence in the robustness of country tax regimes. We support the work undertaken by the OECD in relation to Pillar One and Pillar Two requirements and the position that income earned in a country should be reflective of the economic activity undertaken in that country. We encourage governments to continue to work together to adopt a globally consistent approach to these requirements in order to balance the compliance complexity for companies operating across a number of territories.

Operating with transparency forms a core part of CSL's tax management philosophy and as such our annual tax transparency reports can be found on CSL.com (Sustainability).

Issued Capital Ordinary Shares: 482,369,261 as at 30 June 2023; 482,369,261 as at 31 July 2023.

# Details of incorporation

CSL's activities were carried on within the Commonwealth Department of Health until the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Commission was formed as a Statutory Act 1961 (Cth) (the CSL Act) on 2 November 1961. On 1 April 1991, the Corporation was converted to a public company limited by shares under the Corporations Law of the Australian Capital Territory and it was renamed Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Limited. These changes were brought into effect by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (Conversion into Public Company) Act 1990 (Cth). On 7 October 1991, the name was changed to CSL Limited. The Commonwealth divested all of its shares by public float on 3 June 1994.

The CSL Sale Act 1993 (Cth) amends the CSL Act to impose certain restrictions on the voting rights of persons having significant foreign shareholdings, and certain restrictions on CSL itself. CSL ordinary shares (being the only class of shares on issue) have been traded on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) under the ticker code: CSL since 30 May 1994. Melbourne is the Home Exchange.

In June 2014, CSL commenced a sponsored Level 1 American Depositary Receipts (ADR) program with the Bank of New York Mellon. The sponsored ADR program replaced the unsponsored ADR programs that previously operated with CSL's involvement.

The American Depositary Receipts are traded on the over-the counter (OTC) securities market in the United States. Two ADRs represent one ordinary share in CSL.

In terms of voting, ADR holders can instruct the Depositary, Bank of New York Mellon, to act as proxy for the underlying shares. Particulars for the sponsored ADR program are: US Exchange - OTC and DR Ticker Symbol - CSLLY.

On a poll, each shareholder present in person or by proxy, attorney or representative has one vote for each fully paid share held. In accordance with the CSL Act, CSL's Constitution provides that the votes attaching to significant foreign shareholdings are not to be counted when they pertain to the appointment, removal or replacement of more than one-third of the directors of CSL who hold office at any particular time.

# Reporting Boundary

Our disclosure covers the businesses and operations over which we exercise direct control and incorporates CSL Limited, CSL Behring (including CSL Plasma), CSL Seirus, CSL Vifor and global research and development (R&D). This includes our nine manufacturing facilities in Australia, China, Europe, the UK and the United States as well as R&D, sales and marketing, distribution and administration activities co-located with these facilities. Other R&D activities, sales and marketing, distribution and administrative activities occurring away from our manufacturing facilities are also covered by this report, including the full network of donation centres, laboratories and administration offices operated by CSL Plasma. Where indicated, CSL Vifor, which was acquired in August 2022, has been excluded in some metrics as integration/harmonisation activities continue.

Adjuvant is a substance which enhances the body's immune response to an antigen.

Albumin is any protein that is soluble in water and moderately concentrated salt solutions and is coagulable by heat. It is found in egg whites, blood, lymph, and other tissues and fluids. In the human body, serum albumin is the major plasma protein (approximately  $60\%$  of the total).

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is an inherited disorder that may cause lung disease and liver disease.

Antivenom (or antivenin, or antivenene) is a biological product used in the treatment of venomous bites or stings.

Autoimmune disease is when the body's immune system attacks healthy cells.

Biopharmaceuticals are proteins (including antibodies), nucleic acids (DNA, RNA or antisense oligonucleotides) used for prophylactic or therapeutic purposes.

Cell-based (technology) for the manufacture of influenza vaccines, is a process of growing viruses in animal cells.

Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a neurological disorder which causes gradual weakness and a loss in sensation mainly in the arms and legs.

Coagulation is the process of clot formation.

Coronavirus is a group of RNA viruses that cause a variety of respiratory, gastrointestinal and neurological diseases in humans and other animals.

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.

Haemophilia is a haemorrhagic cluster of diseases occurring in two main forms:

Haemophilia A (classic haemophilia, factor VIII deficiency), an X linked disorder due to deficiency of coagulation factor VIII.

Haemophilia B (factor IX deficiency, Christmas disease), also X linked, due to deficiency of coagulation factor IX.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare but serious genetic disorder caused by low levels or improper function of a protein called Cl-esterase inhibitor. It causes swelling, particularly of the face and airways, and abdominal cramping.

Immunoglobulins (IgG), also known as antibodies, are proteins produced by plasma cells. They are designed to control the body's immune response by binding to substances in the body that are recognised as foreign antigens (often proteins on the surface of bacteria or viruses).

Inherited respiratory diseases are diseases that are passed from parents to their children through their genes. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is an example of an inherited disorder that may cause lung disease and liver disease.

Influenza, commonly known as flu, is an infectious disease of birds and mammals caused by an RNA virus of the family Orthomyxoviridae (the influenza viruses).

Intravenous is the administration of drugs or fluids directly into a vein.

Monoclonal antibody (mAb) is an antibody produced by a single clone of cells. Monoclonal antibodies are a cornerstone of immunology and are increasingly coming into use as therapeutic agents.

Neurology is the science of nerves and the nervous system.

Next-generation mRNA (sa-mRNA) is a technology designed to enhance protein production within cells. With this technology, the mRNA incorporates an element that allows the host cell to make copies of the administered mRNA, which in turn increases the amount of protein that the cell produces. This next-generation technology makes it useful for vaccine development at lower doses than with the original mRNA vaccines, and as an approach in gene therapy. Offering improved protein expression that potentially enhances the effectiveness of treatments and enables more robust therapeutic interventions are some of the benefits of this approach.

Pandemic is the worldwide spread of a disease.

Pharmacovigilance is the practice of monitoring the effects of medical drugs after they have been licensed for use, especially in order to identify and evaluate previously unreported adverse reactions.

# 7. Developments in operations in future years and expected results

The OFR sets out information on CSL's business strategies and prospects for future financial years and refers to likely developments in CSL's operations and the expected results of those operations in future financial years. Certain information is excluded because it is likely to result in material detriment or unreasonable prejudice to the Group.

# 8. Significant changes and subsequent events

# CEO Transition

On 13 December 2022, CSL announced the appointment of Dr Paul McKenzie as Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of CSL with effect from 6 March 2022, upon the retirement of Mr Paul Perreault.

# CSL Vifor acquisition

On 9 August 2022, CSL completed the acquisition of CSL Vifor. See Note 2 (Business Combination) and Note 11 (Financial Risk Management) of the Financial Statements for further details.

Other than as disclosed in the Directors' Report (which includes the OFR) and information as disclosed in Note 24 (Subsequent Events) of the Financial Statements, the directors are not aware of:

- any significant changes in the consolidated entity's state of affairs during the year or to the Group's principal activities during the year; or  
- any other matter or circumstance which has arisen since the end of the financial year which has significantly affected or may significantly affect the operations of the Group, results of those operations or the state of affairs of the Group in subsequent financial years.

# 9. Environmental regulation and compliance

To meet industry and regulatory standards at our facilities, CSL uses an Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Management System. This system covers compliance with government regulations and commitments for continuous improvement of health and safety in the workplace, as well as minimising the negative effects of operations on the environment.

In 2022/23, CSL improved global alignment across several key EHS programs. This included updating the Global EHS audit and governance program and the development of standardised global processes to identify and control activities, where the absence or failure to use a control could expose employees to serious injury or fatality. The focus on the identification and standardised control of EHS risk across the CSL network will continue in 2023/24.

CSL continues to mature our overall environmental sustainability program, imbedding environmental considerations into our work practices. Key environmental principles are driven by processes like our EHS by Design program (and the operational identification of environmental aspects and impacts), in alignment with ISO 14001 principles, to further reduce CSL's potential impact on the environment and our local communities.

Our Australian subsidiaries continue to be classified as an established licensee in respect of CSL's self-insurance license as granted by the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission with an eight-year license extension granted in 2023.

The following notices were provided to CSL by local government agencies in 2022/23:

- In 2022, CSL Seqirus, Holly Springs (United States) received a Notice of Violation (lowest level of violation with no monetary impact) from the state Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ). The notice was associated with some minor labelling and administrative document updates.  
- In 2022, CSL Plasma (United States) received an Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Citation: Other than serious, with non-monetary violation for non-contiguous blood borne pathogen procedure.  
- In 2023, CSL Plasma (United States) received an OSHA Citation: Other than serious, with a US\(600 fine for failing to report an employee hospitalisation within the required time frame.  
- In 2023 CSL's facility in Pasadena (United States) received a violation with no monetary impact from the local fire department, for a flammable cabinet in one of the research labs that did not have an automatic closure device.  
- In 2023, CSL's facility in Wuhan (China) was issued a violation by the environmental protection authority for failing to meet discharge limits of chemical oxygen demand (COD) as outlined in the site's discharge permit. The penalty issued was US$16,548 (RMB120,000).

CSL has met its reporting obligations under the Australian Government's National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 and Victorian Government's Industrial Waste Management Policy (National Pollutant Inventory).

Additional EHS performance details, including workplace safety, can be found in CSL's People on page 40 and Environment on page 46.

# 10. Directors' shareholdings and interests

The interests of the directors in the shares, options and performance rights of CSL are set out in the Remuneration Report – Tables 11 and 12 for executive key management personnel (KMP) and Tables 16 and 17 for non-executive directors. The Group's Securities Dealing Policy prohibits KMP from entering into transactions which limit exposure to risk in relation to securities granted under CSL's equity incentive schemes. From time to time the Company Secretary makes inquiries of KMP as to their compliance with this policy.

# 11. Performance rights and options

As at 30 June 2023, the number of unissued ordinary shares in CSL under options and under performance rights are set out in Note 6 (People Costs) and Note 19 (Detailed Information - Shareholder Returns) of the Financial Statements. Holders of options or performance rights do not have any right, by virtue of the options or performance rights, to participate in any share issue by CSL or any other body corporate or in any interest issued by any registered managed investment scheme.

The number of options and performance rights exercised during the financial year and the exercise price paid to acquire fully paid ordinary shares in CSL is set out in Note 6 (People Costs) of the Financial Statements. Since the end of the financial year, no shares were issued under CSL's Performance Rights Plan.

Since the end of the financial year, 2,124 Restricted Share Units have been forfeited due to participant cessation of employment.

There has been no change to the information contained in Note 18 (Detailed Information – People Costs) to the Financial Statements or Note 19 (Detailed Information – Shareholder Returns).

# 12. Indemnification of directors and officers

During the financial year, the insurance and indemnity arrangements discussed below were in place concerning directors and officers of the consolidated entity.

CSL has entered into a Director's Deed with each director regarding access to Board papers, indemnity and insurance. Each deed provides:

1. an ongoing indemnity to the relevant director against liability incurred by that director as an officer of CSL or a related body corporate. The indemnity is given to the extent permitted by law and to the extent and for the amount that the relevant director is not otherwise entitled to be, and is not actually, indemnified by another person or out of the assets of a corporation, where the liability is incurred in or arising out of the conduct of the business of that corporation or in the discharge of the duties of the director in relation to that corporation;

2. that CSL will purchase and maintain an insurance policy which covers directors against liability as a director and officer of CSL. Coverage will be maintained for a minimum of seven years following the cessation of office for each director; and  
3. the relevant director with a right of access to Board papers in connection with any relevant proceedings.

In addition to the Director's Deeds, Rule 95 of CSL's constitution requires CSL to indemnify each 'officer' of CSL and of each wholly owned subsidiary of CSL out of the assets of CSL 'to the relevant extent' against any liability incurred by the officer in or arising out of the conduct of the business of CSL or in the conduct of the business of such wholly owned subsidiary of CSL or in the discharge of the duties of the officer, unless incurred in circumstances which the Board resolves do not justify indemnification. Further details are set out in the Constitution, available on CSL.com (We Are CSL > Corporate Governance).

No payment has been made to indemnify a current or former director or officer during or since the financial year.

CSL paid insurance premiums in respect of a contract insuring each individual director of CSL and each full time executive officer, director and secretary of CSL and its controlled entities, against certain liabilities and expenses (including liability for certain legal costs) arising as a result of work performed in their respective capacities, to the extent permitted by law. It is a condition of the insurance contract that no details of the premiums payable or the nature of the liabilities insured are disclosed.

In addition, CSL Behring, as the employing entity, indemnifies both the former and current CEO if they are subject to additional tax on their remuneration in any jurisdiction other than the United States. Under this indemnity, CSL agrees to reimburse the CEO for the net difference between US and foreign tax liabilities after taking into account any credits available to the CEO in the United States. To the extent that this is an additional benefit, the reimbursement will be grossed up by CSL before payment.

No payment has been made in respect of this indemnity during or since the financial year.

# 13. Indemnification of auditors

To the extent permitted by law, CSL has agreed to indemnify its auditors, Ernst & Young, as part of the terms of its audit engagement agreement against claims by third parties arising from the audit (for an unspecified amount). No payment has been made to indemnify Ernst & Young during or since the financial year. No insurance premiums were paid for Ernst & Young during the financial year.

# 14. Auditor independence and non-audit services

CSL may decide to employ the auditor on assignments additional to their statutory audit duties where the auditor's expertise and experience with CSL and/or the consolidated entity are important.

Details of the amounts paid or payable to the entity's auditor, Ernst & Young, for non-audit services provided during the year are set out below. The directors, in accordance with the advice received from the Audit and Risk Management Committee, are satisfied that the provision of non-audit services is compatible with, and did not compromise, the general standard of independence for auditors imposed by the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) for the following reasons:

1. all non-audit services have been reviewed by the Audit and Risk Management Committee to confirm that they do not affect the impartiality and objectivity of the auditor; and  
2. none of the services undermine the general principles relating to auditor independence as set out in Professional Statement F1, including reviewing or auditing the auditor's own work, acting in a management or a decision making capacity for CSL, acting as an advocate for CSL or jointly sharing economic risks and rewards.

A copy of the auditors' independence declaration as required under section 307C of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) accompanies and forms part of this report.

Note 20 (Auditor Remuneration) of the Financial Statements shows the fees that were paid or were payable for services provided by CSL's auditor and by the auditor's related practices for the 2022/23 financial year.

In line with an observed trend in many jurisdictions towards a tenure limit for audit firms, CSL completed its competitive external audit tender process during FY2021/22. The Company has recommended the appointment of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu as the Company's external auditor commencing for the year ending 30 June 2024, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval.

# 15. Rounding

The amounts contained in this report and in the financial report have been rounded to the nearest million dollar (where rounding is applicable) unless specifically stated otherwise under the relief available to the Company under ASIC Corporations Instrument 2016/191. CSL is an entity to which the Instrument applies.

# Independent Limited Assurance Report to the Management and Directors of CSL Limited

# Our Conclusion

Ernst & Young ('EY', 'we') were engaged by CSL Limited ('CSL') to undertake a limited assurance engagement as defined by Australian Auditing Standards, hereafter referred to as a 'review', over the Subject Matter defined below for the year ended 30 June 2023. Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe the Subject Matter has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria defined below.

# What our review covered

We reviewed CSL's preparation and application of its materiality process against the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 2016 Standards' Materiality Principle for defining reporting content, as included in CSL's 2023 Annual Report ('the Report') and online at https://www.csl.com/sustainability/governance/stakeholder-engagement-and-material-topics.

# EY

Building a better working world

CSL's responsibility

CSL's management is responsible for selecting the Criteria, and for presenting the materiality process, identified material topics and Selected Disclosures in accordance with that Criteria, in all material respects. This responsibility includes establishing and maintaining internal controls, maintaining adequate records and making estimates that are relevant to the preparation of the subject matter, such that it is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

# Our approach to conducting the review

We conducted this review in accordance with the Australian Auditing and Assurance Standards Board's Australian Standard on Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information ('ASAE 3000') and the terms of reference for this engagement as agreed with CSL on 13 July 2023. That standard requires that we plan and perform our engagement to express a conclusion on whether anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Subject Matter is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria, and to issue a report.

# Summary of review procedures performed

A review consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for preparing the Selected Disclosures and related information and applying analytical and other review procedures.

The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depend on our judgement, including an assessment of the risk of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The procedures we performed included, but were not limited to:

Assessed the Report for disclosure of the materiality process and the coverage of identified topics in line with the GRI principle of materiality for defining report content  
Conducted interviews with key personnel at the corporate level and selected sites to understand CSL's process for collecting, collating, and reporting the Selected Disclosures during the reporting period  
$\triangleright$  Understand processes and controls supporting preparation and presentation of the Selected Disclosures  
> Undertook analytical review procedures to support the reasonableness of the data  
Performed recalculations of Selected Disclosures to check reported quantities  
Tested, on a sample basis, underlying source information to check the accuracy of the data  
Assessed Selected Disclosures against regulatory body websites to confirm accuracy and completeness of reporting  
> Tested aggregation of site-based Selected Disclosures and transcription to the Report  
Reviewed the presentation of the Selected Disclosures within the Annual Report

We believe that the evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our review conclusion.

# Building a better working world

Inherent limitations

4

Procedures performed in a review engagement vary in nature and timing from and are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a review engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. Our procedures were designed to obtain a limited level of assurance on which to base our conclusion and do not provide all the evidence that would be required to provide a reasonable level of assurance.

While we considered the effectiveness of management's internal controls when determining the nature and extent of our procedures, our assurance engagement was not designed to provide assurance on internal controls. Our procedures did not include testing controls or performing procedures relating to assessing aggregation or calculation of data within IT systems.

The GHG quantification process is subject to scientific uncertainty, which arises because of incomplete scientific knowledge about the measurement of GHGs. Additionally, GHG procedures are subject to estimation and measurement uncertainty resulting from the measurement and calculation processes used to quantify emissions within the bounds of existing scientific knowledge.

# Other matters

We have not performed assurance procedures in respect of any information relating to prior reporting periods, including those presented in the Subject Matter, other than for baseline data as stated in the subject matter above. Our report does not extend to any disclosures or assertions made by CSL relating to future performance plans and/or strategies disclosed in CSL's 2023 Annual Report or supporting disclosures online.

# Use of our Assurance Report

We disclaim any assumption of responsibility for any reliance on this assurance report to any persons other than management and the Directors of CSL, or for any purpose other than that for which it was prepared. Our review included web-based information that was available via web links as of the date of this statement. We provide no assurance over changes to the content of this web-based information after the date of this assurance statement.

# 16. Remuneration Report

Dear Fellow Shareholder,

On behalf of the Board of Directors, I am pleased to present CSL's Remuneration Report (Report) for the financial year ended 30 June 2023 (2023). This Report contains detailed information regarding CSL's Key Management Personnel (KMP) for 2023.

CSL plays a critical role in the global community – providing life-saving therapies to people with serious disease, and vaccines that protect public health. The Board is proud of the entire CSL team for delivering on this promise during 2023.

# Delivering on our Promise in 2023

Under the leadership of our former Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director (CEO), Mr Paul Perreault, and our CEO, Dr Paul McKenzie, CSL remained focused on its promise to patients and public health and delivered:

- NPATA<sup>1</sup> attributable to CSL Limited shareholders of US$2,610m;  
Cashflow from Operations (CFO) of US\(2,601m;  
An annual Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) of  $12.2\%$  
- Earnings per Share (EPS) based on net profit attributable to CSL Limited shareholders of US$4.55;  
- Strong plasma collection growth and 12 new plasma centres opened;  
- Continued growth in the Research and Development pipeline progression;  
- HEMGENIX® launched in the US and EU;  
- New registrations across all therapeutic areas;  
- A licence agreement signed with Arcturus Therapeutics for late-stage self-amplifying mRNA vaccine technology;  
- Completion and progression of capacity and capital expansion projects; and  
- Significant progress on embedding long-term sustainability approaches and governance with all targets achieved.

We also welcomed Vifor Pharma to the CSL Group, adding a complementary portfolio of products and a market leading position in the nephrology and iron deficiency fields. The integration is substantially complete and the cost synergies are well on track.

# KMP Changes

As announced in December 2022, Dr McKenzie was appointed as an Executive Director on 13 December 2022 and commenced as CEO on 6 March 2023. Details of Dr McKenzie's CEO arrangements can be found in section 2.2 of the Report. Mr Perreault stepped down as CEO on 5 March 2023 and from that date ceased to be KMP. He remains with the company as a strategic advisor until he retires on 6 September 2023. Details of Mr Perreault's termination arrangements can be found in section 2.2 of the Report.

We are also pleased to welcome Mr Andrew Schmeltz who joined CSL on 30 June 2023 in the role of Executive Vice President CSL Behring. Mr Schmeltz will become KMP during 2024.

Finally, Mr Bruce Brook has indicated that he will retire from the Board during the 2024 financial year after serving four terms as a Non-Executive Director (NED).

# 2023 CEO Remuneration Outcomes

On appointment to his role as CEO, Dr McKenzie's remuneration package comprised:

Fixed Reward of US$1,750,000;  
- A short term incentive (STI) target of  $120\%$  of Fixed Reward; and  
- A long term incentive (LTI) target held at  $425\%$  of Fixed Reward.

These amounts result in a Total Target Direct Compensation that is  $10\%$  lower than for the former CEO.

For the full 2023 performance year, Dr McKenzie will receive a STI payment of US$1,376,890 (51% of maximum opportunity) for performance across both the Chief Operating Officer and CEO roles.

As the ROIC performance targets set for LTI awards tested in 2023 were not all met, there was only partial vesting of Dr McKenzie's awards.

The 2023 'realised' remuneration for Dr McKenzie was US\(4,351,551.

As communicated in the 2022 Report, Mr Perreault received a Fixed Reward increase of  $3.5\%$  effective 1 September 2022 taking this to US $1,866,654. There was no change to his STI target and he received an increase in his LTI target to \(450\%$  from  $400\%$  of Fixed Reward. For the period he was KMP, Mr Perreault will receive a STI payment of US\)1,537,182 and has 2023 'realised' remuneration of US$6,040,346, including partial vesting on LTI outcomes.

# Board Adjustments Applied to Remuneration

# STI

The Board reviews the quality of earnings and risk management outcomes each year. This year the Board made some adjustments to NPATA and CFO for matters not anticipated at the time of target setting, which resulted in a net adjustment downward to STI outcomes. The NPATA vesting outcome was at target and the CFO outcome was below target. Further detail is provided in section 5.2. The Leading and Managing Modifier was not applied in 2023.

# LTI

Looking forward, there are three unvested LTI awards that were granted to Executives prior to the acquisition of Vifor Pharma (granted over calendar years 2019 to 2021). These will be tested in calendar years 2023 and 2024. At the time of the grants, performance hurdle targets against the metrics of ROIC and EPS growth were set based on the financial projections undertaken at the time and did not consider a material acquisition. The Board has determined that it will keep these performance targets and what is measured constant and will take into account CSL Vifor performance when considering overall vesting outcomes. Further detail is provided in section 10.3. All grants made after the acquisition include the contribution of CSL Vifor.

The Board also retains discretion to adjust outcomes to take account of company performance, individual performance and alignment with the shareholder experience.

# Remuneration Framework Changes Introduced in 2023

As disclosed last year, the following changes were made to the STI plan in 2023:

- Introduction of a global sustainability measure with a weighting of  $5\%$ . This measure was introduced to focus our Executives on establishing a robust program governance process, reducing  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  emissions, incorporating sustainable design in our new facilities, and engaging with our supply partners to achieve a low emission supply chain; and  
- To align with our financial guidance approach, the NPAT STI metric was replaced with NPATA. The Board believes this measure provides shareholders with improved transparency on the underlying performance of the business.

# Remuneration in 2024

# Executive KMP

As discussed in prior year Reports and across investor meetings, the Board continues to review and adjust the reward of Executive KMP to drive positioning towards the median of our global pharmaceutical/biotechnology peer group.

For 2024, the Board has determined that in line with our global workforce:

- Dr McKenzie will receive a  $3.5\%$  increase to Fixed Reward and no change to his STI or LTI target. This increase positions Dr McKenzie at  $74\%$  of the median of our global pharmaceutical/biotechnology peer group; and  
- Ms Joy Linton, our Chief Financial Officer, will receive an increase to Fixed Reward of  $3.95\%$ , inclusive of the superannuation guarantee increase applied at 1 July 2023. Ms Linton will have no change to her STI and LTI targets. Ms Linton's position against the global pharmaceutical/biotechnology peer group will be  $70\%$  of the median.

# NED fees

Following benchmarking against ASX12 NED remuneration, there will be an increase in fees of  $3\%$  for all Board and Committee roles, effective 1 July 2023. The increase enables CSL to offer a competitive fee to attract and retain experienced directors. The total amount payable to NEDs will remain within the existing fee pool approved by shareholders on 12 October 2016.

# Remuneration Framework Changes in 2024

In 2023, we received feedback from our shareholders and external stakeholders regarding the LTI ROIC measure. We value your feedback and from 2024 the ROIC performance period will change from seven years (four year look back/ three year forward look) to a three-year forward looking performance period. The ROIC gateway performance measure, which was previously introduced to address concerns about the impact of the four year look back, will not apply to the new three year forward looking measure.

Additionally, an adjustment will be made to the EPS growth LTI metric – we will move from NPAT to NPATA to align with the financial guidance we provide externally.

# Review of the Executive Remuneration Framework in 2024

In competing for talent in a global market, it is critical that we have a remuneration framework that attracts and retains high quality talent to deliver on our strategy and deliver results.

In 2024, the Board will continue to evaluate the Executive KMP remuneration framework to ensure it remains competitive with our global pharmaceutical/biotechnology peers. A key focus will be the further review of our LTI program. As we talk to our stakeholders over the coming months, we will further share our thinking and seek feedback.

Thank you to my fellow HRRC members and thank you for supporting CSL and the patients we serve around the world.

# 1. CSL Key Management Personnel

This Report sets out remuneration information for CSL's Key Management Personnel (KMP) which includes Non-Executive Directors (NEDs), the Executive Director (i.e. the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director (CEO)) and those key senior executives who have authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of CSL during the financial year (together with the Executive Director, referred to as Executive KMP). The CSL KMP during the financial year ended 30 June 2023 (2023) and changes to KMP are outlined in Table 1. Each of the KMP listed in Table 1 held their position for the full reporting period, unless stated otherwise.

On 6 March 2023, Dr Paul McKenzie commenced as CEO, succeeding Mr Paul Perreault. Dr McKenzie was appointed an Executive Director on 13 December 2022.

On 5 March 2023, Mr Perreault stepped down as CEO and ceased to be KMP from that date. Mr Perreault will remain with CSL as a strategic advisor until his retirement in September 2023.

On 30 June 2023, CSL welcomed Mr Andrew Schmeltz who was appointed to the position of Executive Vice President CSL Behring, overseeing Commercial Development and Operations, Therapeutic Area Strategy, Market Access, Plasma Strategy and Operations, Supply Chain, Operations, Manufacturing, Procurement, Planning, Safety, and Quality across the CSL Behring business. Given the significant remit of Mr Schmeltz's role, he will become KMP during 2024 and all remuneration details will be presented in CSL's 2024 Remuneration Report.

In 2024, Mr Bruce Brook will retire from the Board after serving four terms as a NED.

# 2.1 2023 Executive KMP Realised Remuneration

The table below discloses the 'realised' remuneration for the year ended 30 June 2023 in US Dollars (US$). This is a voluntary disclosure which the Board believes presents a simple and transparent view of what the Executive KMP's actual take-home pay was in 2023. These outcomes are aligned with the Executive KMP's and CSL's performance during 2023, as well as being aligned to CSL's longer term performance. See section 6 Table 10 for the Statutory Remuneration disclosure that has been prepared in accordance with the Australian accounting standards. The details for Mr Perreault reflect his period as Executive KMP.

2 Includes base salary, retirement/superannuation benefits, and other benefits such as insurances, relocation and allowances paid in 2023.  
3 Relates to STI earned in 2023 and will be paid in September 2023 (refer to section 5.3).  
Value of LTI vested at 1 September 2022 and 1 March 2023 that became unrestricted (refer to section 5.4). The value at vest has been determined by multiplying the number of vested units by the closing share price on the date of vest. This has been converted to US$ at an average exchange rate for the 2023 financial year of 1,48733. The awards for J Linton were commencement benefits earned in 2021 given Ms Linton commenced employment with CSL in 2021.  
5 The value at grant has been determined by multiplying the number of vested units by the closing share price on the date of grant. This has been converted to US$ at an average exchange rate for the 2023 financial year of 1.48733.  
6 This figure shows the increase in market value of the LTI awards due to share price growth between the grant date and the vesting date. The increase in value of the awards is calculated by multiplying the number of vested and/or exercised awards by the difference between the share price of CSL shares on the grant date and the vesting date or exercise date (as applicable). This has been converted to US$ at an average exchange rate for the 2023 financial year of 1.48733.  
7 The 'realised' remuneration for P Perreault is for the period 1 July 2022 to 5 March 2023 being the period P Perreault was Executive KMP.

Dr McKenzie commenced as CSL's CEO on 6 March 2023, succeeding Mr Perreault. Dr McKenzie's remuneration arrangements are described in this Report and a summary of Dr McKenzie's terms of employment were notified to the ASX on 13 December 2022. Dr McKenzie's employment terms are largely consistent with those of Mr Perreault, except that Dr McKenzie's starting CEO salary and LTI target opportunity are lower than Mr Perreault's and therefore Dr McKenzie has a lower Total Target Direct Compensation (TDC) in dollar terms. Dr McKenzie is a United States (US) based executive and under his employment contract CSL has agreed to indemnify him for any additional non-US tax payable on his remuneration.

# Outgoing CEO

Mr Perreault stepped down from his role as CEO on 5 March 2023. Mr Perreault will remain with CSL as a strategic advisor, to assist in an orderly transition, until he retires on 6 September 2023. Mr Perreault will continue to receive his base salary, pension contributions, statutory leave entitlements and applicable benefits up to the date of his retirement from CSL. Mr Perreault was employed for the entire 2023 financial year and remained eligible to receive his STI award for 2023.

On cessation of employment, consistent with plan rules, Mr Perreault's unvested LTI awards under the 2021, 2022 and 2023 Executive Performance and Alignment Plan will be pro-rated to reflect the portion of service performed during the relevant performance periods and will remain on foot to be assessed in the ordinary course, subject to satisfaction of the applicable performance conditions. Mr Perreault is not eligible to receive a STI payment or LTI grant in respect of 2024.

In accordance with the terms of Mr Perreault's employment contract, CSL intends to enforce the 12-month non-compete covenant and will make a payment to Mr Perreault equivalent to 12-months of his base salary at the time of retirement, scaled back to the maximum amount payable under his termination benefits cap. This amount is expected to be US\(1.9 million and is not included in the Statutory Remuneration disclosure in section 6 Table 10.

Similar to Dr McKenzie, Mr Perreault is a US based executive and under his employment contract CSL has agreed to indemnify him for any additional non-US tax payable on his remuneration.

# 3.2 Remuneration Framework

CSL's remuneration framework includes reward components of Fixed Reward (or base salary (FR)), and variable reward in the form of STI and LTI. These traditional elements are enhanced with several design factors to directly reflect the complexity of CSL's business, a very different business to other companies in Australia, and with a diverse global employee and shareholder base. CSL's international footprint requires global leadership and, with executives based in different countries, there is a need to put in place a framework that is fair, equitable and market competitive in the countries and industry in which CSL operates in order to attract and retain highly talented people.

# 3.2.3 Pay Mix

The following diagrams set out the remuneration mix for Executive KMP in 2023. The majority of the target reward mix is variable reward (STI and LTI) and is at risk. This creates strong alignment between Executive KMP rewards and shareholder interests and is aligned to our pay for performance philosophy, focusing efforts on driving growth and long term performance and sustainability.

Remuneration Mix - J Linton (Chief Financial Officer)

The diagram above does not include sign-on grants awarded to Ms Linton on 1 April 2021, some of which vested in 2023.

As at the date Mr Perreault ceased to be Executive KMP, Mr Perreault had a target reward mix comprising  $15\%$  FR,  $18\%$  STI and  $67\%$  LTI. Prior to his appointment as CEO, Dr McKenzie held the role of COO and had a target reward mix comprising  $16\%$  FR,  $16\%$  STI and  $68\%$  LTI. Dr McKenzie did not receive additional remuneration for his role as Executive Director between 13 December 2022 and his appointment to CEO on 6 March 2023.

# 3.2.4 Short Term Incentive (STI)

Rewarding performance over an annual period, the STI program is designed to drive business performance and create sustainable shareholder value. The KPIs on which Executive KMP are assessed and rewarded are deliberately challenging and over and above the normal expectations of their role.

The key features of the STI program for the year ended 30 June 2023 (to be paid in September 2023) are detailed below.

<table><tr><td>Feature</td><td colspan="3">Description</td></tr><tr><td>Performance Period</td><td colspan="3">Annual award aligned with the financial year – 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2023</td></tr><tr><td>Award</td><td colspan="3">Cash</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">Performance Measures</td><td colspan="3">Each Executive KMP has a maximum of seven KPIs. The KPIs are made up of two financial measures, common to all participants – Net Profit after Tax and before Amortisation (NPATA) and Cash Flow from Operations (CFO), a sustainability measure, plus up to four individual business building KPIs. Hurdles are set at threshold, target and maximum levels of performance with a significant difference between each performance level to ensure a challenging but meaningful incentive is provided for target performance. The performance measures are chosen to ensure Executive KMP are focused on the achievement of the CSL strategy, delivery of business results and CSL&#x27;s success and sustainability</td></tr><tr><td>Financial</td><td>Sustainability</td><td>Individual</td></tr><tr><td>Profitable financial growth is the foundation of CSL&#x27;s long-term sustainability.

See section 9 for further details on CSL&#x27;s Malus and Clawback Policy</td></tr></table>

# 3.2.5 Long Term Incentive (LTI)

CSL's LTI plan is designed to align executives' equity interests with those of our shareholders by rewarding sustainable Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) and Earnings per Share (EPS) growth outcomes.

This approach ensures a focus on the sustainable long-term growth of the organisation and delivering returns to our shareholders. Vesting of awards will only occur where company performance has been strong over the performance period. When target performance is achieved, it follows that executives' LTI should vest – targets are therefore set that require excellent outcomes for shareholders, both absolutely and relative to the performance of CSL's global peers.

Granted annually with vesting after three years, in 2023 (grant date of 1 November 2022), CSL's LTI plan adopts two key performance measures of ROIC (weighted  $70\%$ ) and EPS growth (weighted  $30\%$ ). The three year single point vesting approach aligns with the approach taken by CSL's global pharmaceutical/biotechnology peers – a group with which CSL competes to attract and retain talent.

# ROIC

CSL's Research and Development (R&D) cycle requires sustained investment over the longer term, as do major capital capacity projects, which are often multi-year investments needed to support the future growth of the organisation. Developing a new life-saving product can take more than ten years from scientific inception through to manufacturing and commercialisation. Economic returns are then generated in subsequent years.

To date, CSL adopted a seven-year average ROIC to measure real achievement against this metric as a fair representation of the R&D and capital investment profile. This calculation spans four years of historical ROIC performance and three years of projected ROIC performance, thereby placing the forward 'at-risk' years into the context of the overall investment cycle.

The ROIC calculation is Reported EBIT x (1- Effective Tax Rate)/(Average Equity + Average Net Debt) where Net debt equals cash, less interest-bearing liabilities and Average Equity and Average Net Debt is the average of the opening position on 1 July and closing position on 30 June of the respective financial year.

The Board establishes a new ROIC hurdle target for each annual grant. This process considers both the CSL budget and longer-term forecast annual ROIC over the term of the grant, together with the historical annual ROIC achieved that will form part of the performance assessment over the testing period. Historical performance of the peer group and market consensus are also considered.

# EPS Growth

EPS growth is a measure that aligns executive LTI outcomes with the returns experienced by shareholders. The EPS growth target is assessed as compound annual growth with a base of the most recent financial year's EPS and a target based on CSL's estimation of EPS growth over the three-year performance period. EPS is calculated as EPS = CSL reported net profit in USD/Weighted average number of shares on issue.

The Board determines the EPS growth hurdle based on past, current and expected EPS performance over the performance period and, historical performance of our peer group. A review against market consensus is also undertaken to ensure the target set is aligned with expected outcomes and appropriate vesting occurs.

The key features of CSL's LTI program for our 2023 awards, granted 1 November 2022, are as follows.

<table><tr><td>Feature</td><td>Description</td></tr><tr><td>Summary</td><td>A conditional &#x27;right&#x27; to a CSL share or at the Board&#x27;s discretion in exceptional circumstances, a cash equivalent payment.

8 Also maximum opportunity.  
9 As outlined in section 2.2, upon cessation of employment, Mr Perreault's 2023 LTI PSUs will be pro-rated for the portion of the performance period employed. He will not receive his maximum opportunity.

# 3.2.6 Leading and Managing Modifier

The Board, taking into consideration recommendations from the CEO for Executive KMP, and the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee (HRRC) for the CEO, has the discretion to apply a 'Leading and Managing' modifier to both the STI and LTI opportunity – allowing for recognition of extraordinary contribution in exceptional circumstances or significant leadership failure across sustainability, risk management, culture and diversity. Applied to the overall STI outcome or LTI target opportunity, there can be an increase of up to 20% or a decrease of up to 50% applied. In 2023, the modifier was not applied.

In addition to consideration during the determination of KPI outcomes, the modifier is also utilised for the assessment of the appropriate management of risk – both financial and non-financial. In consultation with the Audit and Risk Management Committee (ARMC), the HRRC uses a principles based approach to ensure alignment between remuneration outcomes and performance. This enables management to bring awareness to behaviours that encourage unacceptable levels of risk, discourage those behaviours, and promote behaviours that encourage acceptable levels of risk. It also enables the Board to recognise and appropriately address both acceptable and unacceptable behaviours. In the event of a significant risk management failure, the Board has the discretion to adjust STI and LTI outcomes downwards, including to zero.

# 3.2.7 Sign On Arrangements

As set out in the 2021 Remuneration Report, 13,647 sign on restricted share units (RSUs) were granted to Ms Linton on 1 April 2021, as partial compensation for time-based benefits forfeited on leaving her previous employer. Of these, 5,097 RSUs vested in 2023 and the remaining 396 are due to vest on 1 March 2024.

Each RSU is a conditional right to receive a share in CSL (or at the Board's discretion in exceptional circumstances, a cash equivalent payment). No price is payable by Ms Linton on the grant or vesting of RSUs awarded as a sign on award. RSUs are time based awards. Further information as to the terms of the sign on RSUs are set out in the 2021 Remuneration Report.

# 5. Executive Key Management Personnel Outcomes in 2023

# 5.1 2023 Target Remuneration

# P McKenzie

Effective 1 September 2022, the Board determined that Dr McKenzie, in his role of COO, would receive a  $3.5\%$  increase to FR, taking his FR to US $1,015,680. Dr McKenzie's STI target remained at \(100\%$  of FR and he received an increase to his LTI target to  $425\%$  of FR. Dr McKenzie's TDC was US\)6,348,000.

On appointment to the role of CEO, the Board increased Dr McKenzie's FR by  $72\%$  to US $1,750,000, increased his STI target to \(120\%$  of FR and kept his LTI target at  $425\%$  of FR. Effective 6 March 2023, Dr McKenzie's TDC was US\)11,287,500.

# J Linton

In 2023, the Board determined that Ms Linton would receive an increase to FR of  $3.7\%$ . This increase was inclusive of the superannuation guarantee increase from  $10\%$  to  $10.5\%$ . Taking into consideration both the global pharmaceutical/biotechnology and Australian general industry peer groups, skill, experience and internal relativity, Ms Linton's STI target was increased from  $85\%$  to  $100\%$  of FR and her LTI target was increased from  $175\%$  to  $225\%$  of FR. These changes resulted in a TDC of US$3,827,036.

# P Perreault

In 2023, the Board determined that Mr Perreault would receive an increase to FR of  $3.5\%$ , no change to his STI target and an increase to his LTI target to  $450\%$  of FR. These increases resulted in a TDC of US$12,506,579.

# 5.2 CSL and Executive KMP Performance

In 2023, CSL has continued to demonstrate resilience in its results, delivering a strong performance within a challenging operating environment. CSL's focus on improving efficiencies across its global network of manufacturing sites has helped reduce the impact of inflation and currency headwinds and focus remains on executing on CSL's strategy of delivering innovative medicines to our patients. As a result, our NPATA landed in line with expectations and at the top end of market guidance, while CFO was down slightly on the prior year.

Introduced in 2023, outcomes against the new Sustainability measure exceeded expectations with an overall maximum outcome awarded. The following diagram sets out the achievements.

<table><tr><td>Portfolio</td><td rowspan="3">Establish a robust program governance process, including reporting, monitoring and verification that is transparent and aligned with our network strategy.

In determining the outcomes for Executive KMP, the Board reviewed the quality of earnings and risk management outcomes across the year to ensure STI outcomes were appropriately aligned with the overall performance of the company and the experience of CSL's shareholders. In consideration of one-off items not anticipated at the time of target setting, the Board's review resulted in a downward adjustment to the NPATA outcome and an upwards adjustment to the CFO outcome. Overall, this resulted in an average reduction in KMP STI outcomes by  $4.1\%$ .

The Leading and Managing Modifier was not used in 2023. The Board made no adjustments under the Malus and Clawback Policy and no risk management, behaviour or compliance issues involving Executive KMP were identified during the joint consultation between the HRRC and ARMC.

The following performance outcomes were achieved resulting in an average overall STI payment outcome of  $102\%$  of target level opportunity across the Executive KMP (see Table 4). The minimum STI earned as a percentage of target level opportunity was  $101\%$  and the maximum was  $105\%$  – the latter was  $53\%$  of the maximum STI outcome that could be achieved. Table 3 summarises the achievements on the individual KPIs of the Executive KMP. Additional KPIs, which were also integral to the achievement of individual performance, were considered by the Board when assessing Executive KMP performance and remain confidential for commercial reasons.

# 5.4.3 Summary of Executive KMP Equity Granted, Vested and Lapsed in 2023

The table below summarises the details of equity awards granted, vested and lapsed in US$ for each Executive KMP. For awards granted, the maximum number of securities that may vest is shown. For accounting purposes, the maximum value of each grant is the fair value of the equity granted multiplied by the number of equity instruments granted, or remaining each year. Ultimately, the maximum face value of the equity awards will be equal to the number of securities granted multiplied by the CSL share price at the time of vesting. The minimum number of securities and the value of the equity awards is zero if the equity award is fully lapsed. Details of the performance and service criteria applying to awards granted in prior years are summarised in section 10 and prior Remuneration Reports corresponding to the reporting period in which the awards were granted.

# 7. Remuneration in 2024

# 7.1 Executive KMP Remuneration Changes in 2024

CSL competes for talent in a global market and we need to attract and retain high calibre executives in a highly competitive global pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry. The unique skill set with specialised pharmaceutical and biotechnology expertise and experience that CSL requires is critical to enable the company to deliver on its strategy, promise to patients and deliver sustainable returns to shareholders.

The Board determines any increases to reward for Executive KMP based on position in market with the pharmaceutical/biotechnology peer group, individual performance, role responsibilities and internal relativity. When comparing Executive KMP TDC to the reward of peers within the pharmaceutical/biotechnology peer group, all lag the median – specifically on the LTI component – resulting in TDC that is below the median.

# 2024 Target Remuneration - P McKenzie

In 2024, the Board has determined that Dr McKenzie will receive a  $3.5\%$  increase to FR, resulting in a 1 September 2023 figure of US $1,811,250. There will be no change to the STI or LTI targets, remaining at \(120\%$  and  $425\%$  of FR respectively. Dr McKenzie's TDC will be US\)11,682,563 and this is a position of  $74\%$  against the median TDC of the pharmaceutical/ biotechnology peer group.

# 2024 Target Remuneration - J Linton

In keeping in line with the approach taken for all Executives, in 2024, the Board has determined that Ms Linton will have an increase to FR only. Effective 1 July 2023, Ms Linton's FR will be increased by \(0.45\%\) for the Australian superannuation guarantee increase from \(10.5\%\) to \(11\%\) and from 1 September 2023 will be increased by \(3.5\%\). There will be no change to STI and LTI targets resulting in a TDC of US\\(3,978,203. The change for 2024 positions Ms Linton at \(70\%\) of the median TDC of the pharmaceutical/biotechnology peer group.

# 7.2 LTI Framework Changes in 2024

In 2024, a change to the EPS calculation will be introduced. NPAT will be replaced by NPATA as the Board believes this measure provides shareholders with improved transparency of the underlying performance of CSL and aligns with the profit measure being provided as financial guidance externally and, also used to determine the dividend and STI outcomes.

The Board values and has listened to the investor feedback received and will be amending the ROIC performance period and target setting approach. From 2024, this will move from a seven year performance period (four year look back/three year forward look) to three year forward looking. This forward looking performance period is also in line with market practice across our global pharmaceutical/biotechnology peer group and aligns with the approach taken on the EPS hurdle. The ROIC gateway performance measure, which was previously introduced to address concerns about the impact of the four year look back, will not apply to the three year forward looking ROIC metric.

The Board will continue to review the types of equity delivered under our LTI program and will also review target LTI quantum for Executive KMP so that CSL can continue to attract and retain global talent and remain competitive with our global peers.

# 8. Non-Executive Director Remuneration

# 8.1 NED Fee Policy

Feature  
Description  

<table><tr><td>Strategic Objective</td><td>CSL&#x27;s NED fee arrangements are designed to appropriately compensate suitably qualified directors, with the requisite experience and expertise, for their Board responsibilities and contribution to Board committees. In the 2023 year, the Board had four Committees for which fees were payable</td></tr><tr><td>Maximum Aggregate Fees Approved by Shareholders</td><td>The current maximum aggregate fee pool of A$4,000,000 was approved by shareholders on 12 October 2016 and has applied from this date. Actual NED fees paid during the 2023 year (including superannuation contributions, NED Rights Plan sacrifice amounts and Committee fees) are within this agreed limit, and totalled A$3,018,869. NEDs may be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred by them in the course of discharging their duties and this reimbursement is not included within this limit</td></tr><tr><td>Remuneration Reviews</td><td>The Board in conjunction with the HRRC, reviews NED fees on an annual basis in line with general industry practice. Fees are set with reference to the responsibilities and time commitments expected of NEDs along with consideration to the level of fees paid to NEDs of comparable Australian companies</td></tr><tr><td>Independence</td><td>To ensure independence and impartiality is maintained, NEDs do not receive any performance related remuneration</td></tr><tr><td>NED Equity</td><td>The NEDs participate in the NED Rights Plan – introduced to enable NEDs to build up meaningful levels of equity more quickly. Under the plan, NEDs sacrifice at least 20% of their pre-tax base fee in return for a grant of Rights, each Right entitling a NED to acquire one CSL share at no additional cost. The number of Rights granted is equivalent to the fee sacrificed divided by the prevailing market price of CSL shares at that time. Rights are allocated in two tranches and vesting occurs following the disclosure of half year and full year financial results following the grant of Rights. For Australian based NEDs, shares are allocated at vesting of the Rights and are then subject to a nominated restriction period of three to fifteen years. For overseas based NEDs, shares are allocated at the end of the nominated three to fifteen year restriction period. At the end of the nominated restriction period the NED is able to access their shares. No price is payable on vesting and exercise of rights. Shares are automatically allocated without the need for exercise by a NED. As this is a salary sacrifice plan, no performance conditions apply to the Rights. The shares are purchased on-market. Additional shares may be purchased by NEDs on-market at prevailing share prices in accordance with CSL&#x27;s Securities Dealing Policy</td></tr><tr><td>Shareholding Requirement</td><td>NEDs must hold CSL shares equal to 100% of their Board base fee within five years from the date of appointment to the Board</td></tr><tr><td>Post-Employment Benefits</td><td>Superannuation contributions are made in accordance with legislation and are included in the reported base fee and are not additional to the base fee. NEDs are not entitled to any compensation on cessation of appointment</td></tr><tr><td>Contracts</td><td>NEDs are appointed under a letter of appointment and are subject to ordinary election and rotation requirements as stipulated in the ASX Listing Rules and CSL Limited&#x27;s constitution</td></tr></table>

# 8.2 NED Fees in 2023

The following table provides details of current Board and Committee fees from 1 July 2022 and increases to be applied at 1 July 2023. As a truly global business, our NED fee structure allows attraction and recruitment of appropriately skilled directors. The Board continues to monitor the practice of global Australian listed companies and those listed in European and US markets to ensure a competitive structure and fee arrangement is in place.

In 2023, after reviewing ASX12 comparative Board fees, the Board determined to increase Board and Committee fees by  $3\%$  from 1 July 2023. This increase is below the global weighted average budget for employees and is within the maximum aggregate remuneration that may be paid to all NEDs, as agreed by shareholders at the 2016 AGM. These increases ensure market competitive fees and allow CSL to attract and retain high quality NEDs.

The Chairman of the Board does not receive Committee fees in addition to his Board Chairman fee.

A travel allowance of A$15,000 per annum is in place for those NEDs who reside outside of Australia and travel to and from Australia to attend Board and Committee meetings. Where no travel is undertaken in a quarter, no allowance is paid. In 2023, no allowance was paid.

# 8.3 Non-Executive Share Purchases

During 2023, CSL completed two on-market purchases of shares for the purposes of the NED Rights Plan. A total of 2,822 shares were purchased during the reporting period and the average price paid per share was A$295.12.

39 The value at exercise date has been determined by the share price at the close of business on the exercise date multiplied by the number of Rights exercised during 2023. The A$ value was converted to US$ at an average rate for the year of 1.48733.  
40 The number of Rights granted is determined by dividing the NEDs elected percentage of pre-tax base fee (minimum 20%) by the five day volume weighted average price (VWAP) at which CSL shares were traded on the ASX ending on (and including) the last ASX trading day prior to the date of grant of the Rights being 24 August 2022 of A$294.46. The Rights were granted on 25 August 2022 in two tranches. Tranche one had a vesting date of 20 February 2023 and tranche two vests 21 August 2023.  
The value at grant date has been determined by the share price at the close of business on the grant date of 25 August 2022 being A$289.82 multiplied by the number of Rights granted during 2023. The A$ value was converted to US$ at an average exchange rate for the year of 1.48733. The Rights have an expiry date fifteen years from the start of the financial year in which the Rights were granted.  
42 The value of Rights is calculated based on an assessment of the fair market value of the instruments in accordance with the accounting standards (refer to Note 18 in the Financial Statements). The fair value of each Right granted on 25 August 2022 was Tranche 1: A$292.74 and Tranche 2: A$290.97 multiplied by the number of Rights granted during 2023.  
43 Vesting and exercise occurred in relation to Tranche 2 of the 2022 grant and Tranche 1 of the 2023 grant. All Rights eligible vested at  $100\%$  during the year. No Rights eligible to vest were lapsed.  
44 The value at exercise date has been determined by the share price at the close of business on the exercise date multiplied by the number of Rights exercised during 2023. The A\$ value was converted to US\$ at an average exchange rate for the year of 1.48733. Australian based NEDs have Rights exercised at the vesting date and a holding lock is placed on the shares for a period of three to fifteen years as elected by the NED.  
45 Vested Rights are exercisable to the NED at the end of the nominated restriction period. All vested Rights are currently unexercisable until the end of the nominated restriction period.  
46 Unvested Rights represent Tranche 2 of the 2023 grant that will vest on 21 August 2023, following the release of full year financial results.  
47 All PSUs held by A Cuthbertson in his capacity as a member of the Company's Executive KMP until 1 October 2021 are disclosed in prior year Remuneration Reports.

# 9. Remuneration Governance

The following diagram illustrates CSL's remuneration governance framework.

# CSL Board:

The Board is responsible for the oversight and strategic direction of CSL. It monitors operational and financial performance, human resources policies and practices, and approves the company's budgets and business plans. It is also responsible for overseeing CSL's risk management, financial reporting and compliance framework.

The Board reviews, makes comment on and, as appropriate, approves remuneration recommendations from the HRRC. The Board approves the remuneration and remuneration outcomes for the CEO and NEDs and approves the policies and processes that govern both.

# HRRC:

The HRRC has oversight of all aspects of remuneration at CSL. The Board has delegated responsibility to the HRRC for reviewing and making recommendations to the Board with regard to:

Executive remuneration design;  
- Approval of awards to the CEO;  
Senior executive succession planning;  
- The design and implementation of CSL incentive plans (including equity based arrangements);  
- The remuneration and other benefits applicable to NEDs; and  
- The CSL diversity policy and measurable objectives for achieving gender diversity.

The HRRC is able to approve the remuneration of Executive KMP (excluding the CEO).

# Members

Dr Megan Clark AC (Chair), Ms Carolyn Hewson AO, Ms Marie McDonald and Ms Alison Watkins AM.

# ARMC:

The ARMC assists the Board in the governance of CSL's financial reporting and disclosures, risk identification, management and compliance, and oversees and monitors ESG performance.

The ARMC advises the HRRC on any material risk management and financial matters that may impact remuneration outcomes.

# External Remuneration Advisers:

The Board and the HRRC may seek and consider advice directly from external advisors, who are independent of management.

In 2023 the HRRC engaged the services of Aon Consulting in the US, and EY in Australia. Under engagement and communication protocols adopted by CSL, the market data and other advice were provided directly to the HRRC by both Aon Consulting and EY. Neither Aon Consulting nor EY provided Remuneration Recommendations during the 2023 financial year.

# Joint HRRC and ARMC meetings:

The Committees meet jointly at least annually to review and consider relevant risk management matters in the determination of the Executive KMP remuneration outcomes.

# 9.1 HRRC Activities

During 2023, the HRRC met on six occasions. The attendance of the HRRC members at those meetings can be found in the Directors' Report of the 2023 Annual Report available on CSL.com.

Activities undertaken include:

- Review of the executive remuneration framework;  
- Review and consideration of investor feedback received across the year;  
- Appointment of external remuneration advisors;  
- Review of senior executive appointments and remuneration arrangements;  
- Review of STI and LTI arrangements, and reward outcomes for senior executives;  
- Review of the CSL diversity objectives and report, and gender pay review and progress against diversity objectives;  
- Review of talent and succession planning for senior executives;  
- Review of long term remuneration strategy and global trends in remuneration;  
Review of NED remuneration; and  
- Review of the HRRC Charter and HRRC performance.

Full responsibilities of the HRRC are outlined in its Charter (reviewed annually) – available at http://www.csl.com.au/about/governance.htm

# 9.2 Remuneration Determination

The Board has discretion across each element of Executive KMP reward and considers business performance, individual performance and shareholder experience before setting and approving reward outcomes.

Remuneration Recommendations – Reviewed on an annual basis, the CEO makes a recommendation to the HRRC for Executive KMP, with the HRRC recommending to the Board for the CEO, any change to FR and STI and LTI targets for the year ahead. Recommendations take into consideration market conditions, position in market within the global pharmaceutical/biotechnology peer group, individual performance, role responsibilities and internal relativity. Remuneration is reviewed in the context of Total Reward. There is a higher proportion of Total Reward in the form of performance related variable pay.

STI Outcomes – A formal review of Executive KMP progress against KPIs is conducted twice annually by the CEO and annually by the Board for the CEO. Regular performance conversations are held during the year. Following the full year performance review, the CEO makes recommendations in respect of Executive KMP to the HRRC. The HRRC and the Board assess individual performance against KPIs at the end of the financial year, and approve the actual STI payments to be made. The Board determines the outcomes for the CEO, based on recommendations from the HRRC, who are informed by the Chairs of the Board and HRRC. The Board believes this is the most appropriate method of assessment.

LTI Outcomes – The HRRC assesses performance against the hurdle measures set at grant by the Board. Following this, the HRRC undertakes a review to ensure the remuneration outcomes are aligned with overall business performance and the shareholder experience and then submits outcomes to the Board for approval. The Board believes this is the most appropriate method of assessment.

Board Discretion – Prior to approving CEO remuneration outcomes and before finalising all other Executive KMP outcomes, the Board holistically assesses the outcomes and considers whether there are any circumstances warranting application of the Malus and Clawback Policy. It also considers the 'Leading and Managing' modifier and ensures that the interaction of remuneration outcomes is in alignment with risk management outcomes for the year and that any material risk issues and behaviours and/or compliance breaches are addressed. The Board's assessment is informed by the review undertaken by the HRRC in conjunction with the ARMC. The Board has discretion to determine final vesting outcomes to ensure outcomes are in line with CSL performance, market reported financial outcomes and the experience of our shareholders. Discretion may be exercised to either increase or reduce vesting outcomes, which includes reducing to zero.

New Hires and Internal Promotions – The Remuneration Framework set out in section 3.2 applies to the remuneration arrangements for any newly hired or promoted Executive KMP, ensuring a market competitive Total Reward offering. In the case of external hires, the HRRC and Board may determine that it is appropriate for a commencement benefit to be offered. Commencement benefits in the form of cash and/or equity can be made to compensate for remuneration being forfeited from a former employer. For any foregone equity awards, CSL equity will typically be used as compensation. Awards may be discounted to take into consideration any performance conditions on the award at the former employer and the HRRC will determine the appropriate service and performance conditions on the CSL award within the CSL framework. For internal promotions, the HRRC may determine that an award of equity should be made to ensure an appropriate Total Reward package. This is typically done as hurtled equity under the LTI framework described in section 3.2.5.

# 9.3 Contractual Provisions for Executive KMP

Executive KMP are employed on individual service contracts that outline the terms of their employment, which include:

<table><tr><td>Duration of Contract</td><td>Notice Period Employee</td><td>Notice Period CSL*</td><td>Termination Payment</td></tr><tr><td>No fixed term</td><td>Six months</td><td>Six months</td><td>12 months</td></tr></table>

*CSL may also terminate at any time without notice for serious misconduct and/or breach of contract. CSL may also make payment in lieu of notice

The CEO is a US based executive and, under the CEO's employment contract, CSL has agreed to indemnify the CEO if he is subject to additional tax on his remuneration in any jurisdiction other than the US.

# 9.4 Other Transactions

No loans were made, guaranteed or secured, directly or indirectly by CSL or any of its subsidiaries, to any Executive KMP or their related parties during 2023.

No loans were made to NEDs during 2023. To the extent that there were transactions between the Company and an organisation with which a NED may be connected or associated, those transactions were all on normal commercial arms' length terms, immaterial, and the relevant NED had no involvement in any procurement or other Board decision-making related to the transaction.

# 9.5 Malus and Clawback Policy

CSL operates a Malus and Clawback Policy. 'Malus' means adjusting or cancelling all or part of an individual's variable reward as a consequence of a materially adverse development occurring prior to payment (in the case of cash incentives) and/or prior to vesting (in the case of equity incentives). 'Clawback' means seeking recovery of a benefit paid or given to take into account a materially adverse development that only comes to light after payment or award, including shares delivered post vesting.

The Board, in its discretion, may apply the policy to any incentive provided to a senior executive, including a former senior executive, upon the occurrence (or the discovery of the occurrence) of any of the following events or conduct:

- material misstatement, omission or error in the financial statements of a Group company or the CSL Group leading to a senior executive receiving a benefit greater than the amount that would have been received had such misstatement, omission or error not occurred;  
- fraud or dishonesty to CSL or any Group company;  
- wilful engagement in conduct which is, or might reasonably be expected to be, injurious to CSL or any Group company, monetarily or otherwise, including, but not limited to, its reputation or standing in its industry;  
- intentional act that is materially adverse to the best interests of CSL or any Group company;  
- violation of any material law or regulation;  
adverse risk management outcomes; and/or  
- material violation of CSL's Code of Conduct or any other policy governing the conduct of employees of CSL or any Group company or any agreement or covenant entered into between a senior executive and CSL or any Group company.

In 2023, following a joint review of reward outcomes by both the HRRC and the ARMC, there was no application of the Malus and Clawback Policy.

# 9.6 Securities Dealing

The CSL Securities Dealing Policy prohibits employees from using price protection arrangements (e.g. hedging) in respect of CSL securities, or allowing them to be used. The Policy also provides that no CSL securities can be used in connection with a margin loan. Upon vesting of an award, an employee may only deal in their CSL securities in accordance with the Policy. A breach of the Policy may result in disciplinary action. A copy of the Policy is available at http://www.csl.com.au/about/governance.htm.

# 9.7 Minimum Shareholding Guideline

To be met within a target of the first five years of appointment, or within five years for current incumbents, and to be held whilst in the role at CSL, the following levels of vested equity must be held:

CEO: Three times base salary;  
Executive KMP: One times base salary; and  
- NEDs: One times Board base fee.

As at 30 June 2023, all KMP hold, or are on track to hold, the minimum shareholding requirement within the relevant time period.

# 10. Additional Employee Equity Programs and Legacy Plan Information

In addition to the Executive Performance and Alignment Plan LTI program described earlier in this Report, CSL operates two additional employee equity programs – the Global Employee Share Plan and the Retain and Grow Plan. An overview of those programs is provided below.

# 10.1 Global Employee Share Plan

CSL's Global Employee Share Plan (GESP) provides all employees the opportunity to share in the ownership of our company and share in our future.

Operating across two six month contribution periods, an employee can elect to make post tax salary contributions between A $365 and A$ 12,000 per six month period. The employee then receives shares at a  $15\%$  discount to the applicable market rate over the five day period up to and including the first and last ASX trading days of the six month period, whichever is the lower. Shares are then held in restriction for a period of one or three years as determined upfront by the employee. The shares may be issued or purchased on market.

To participate in GESP an employee must have at least six months service at the start of the contribution period. Participation is open to permanent full or part time and fixed term contract employees and excludes Executive Directors.

# 10.2 Retain and Grow Plan

The CSL Group Retain and Grow Plan (RGP) LTI program is designed to attract, motivate and retain key talent across the organisation. RGP provides eligible employees with longer-term share ownership in CSL, enabling them to share in the company's success and any capital growth.

The RGP recognises those individuals in management roles (Manager to Senior Vice President) across the CSL Group. Awards under the RGP are not guaranteed and the CSL Board will review participation on an annual basis.

Key plan elements are as follows

- A conditional 'right' to a CSL share (i.e. full value instrument) or at the Board's discretion, a cash equivalent payment. No price is payable by the participant on grant or vesting of rights. Shares are automatically allocated (or cash automatically paid) without the need for exercise by a participant;  
- The security granted is a RSU;  
- LTI opportunity set as % of local salary (converted to A$ at grant);  
- Number of RSUs determined using face value (five day weighted average share price);  
- Individual performance hurdle – must not fail to meet performance expectations;  
-  $33\%$  of RSUs will vest on the first and second anniversaries of the Issue Date, with the remaining  $34\%$  vesting on the third anniversary;  
- There is no retesting of awards;  
- On cessation of employment a 'qualified leaver' (such as retirement or redundancy) will retain a pro-rated number of RSUs based on time elapsed since grant date, subject to original terms and conditions. If a participant is not a 'qualified leaver', all unvested awards will be forfeited unless the Board determines otherwise;  
- In the event of a change of control, the Board, in its absolute discretion, may determine that some or all of the awards vest having regard to the performance of the participant during the vesting period to the date of the change of control event. Vesting may occur at the date of the change of control event or an earlier vesting date as determined by the Board; and

- No dividends or dividend equivalents are paid on unvested awards. Participants are only eligible for dividends once shares have been allocated following vesting of any RSUs. RSUs do not carry any voting rights prior to vesting and allocation of shares.

Our Senior Vice President and Vice President employees participate in both the Executive Performance and Alignment PSU (described in section 3.2.5) and RGP LTI Plans with a higher portion of awards aligned to the executive plan.

The RGP is also used for commencement benefits, retention and recognition awards at all levels of the organisation. The difference to the annual program is the vesting schedule, which is reviewed and determined on a case by case basis.

# 10.3 Key Characteristics of Prior Financial Year Performance Share Unit Grants

The following table provides information on the key characteristics of the LTI programs on foot during the 2023 reporting period. The 2019 (granted 1 September 2018), 2020 (granted 1 September 2019) and 2021 (granted 1 September 2020) PSU LTI awards have the same key characteristics as the 2023 (granted 1 November 2022) award disclosed in section 3.2.5 with the exception of the hurdle, performance period, performance targets and vesting dates as outlined in Table 18. The ROIC component of the 2022 award (granted 1 September 2021) also aligns with the above, and an EPSg measure was added, weighted  $30\%$  of the award. Details are also included in Table 18 with remaining terms aligning with the detail provided in section 3.2.5.

For the three unvested LTI awards that were granted to Executives prior to the acquisition of Vifor Pharma – 2020 tranche 4 (granted 1 September 2019), 2021 tranches 3 and 4 (granted 1 September 2020) and the 2022 award (granted 1 September 2021) – that will be tested in calendar years 2023 and 2024, the Board has determined that it will make an adjustment to the financial results that will be used to determine vesting.

At the time of the grants, performance hurdle targets against the metrics of ROIC and EPS growth, were set based on the financial projections undertaken at that time and did not consider a material acquisition. The Board has determined that it will not adjust the performance targets and will exclude the impact of CSL Vifor from the audited financial results of the CSL Group to determine the testing outcomes. This will involve the exclusion of the CSL Vifor contribution to Earnings before Interest and Tax (for the ROIC calculation) and NPAT (for the EPS calculation) and the adjustment of debt and equity (for ROIC) to remove the funding specific to the Vifor Pharma acquisition. EPS will be calculated by excluding the shares issued to fund the acquisition from the denominator of the EPS calculation and using NPAT excluding CSL Vifor from the numerator. However, the Board will take into account CSL Vifor performance when considering the overall vesting outcomes.

All grants made after the acquisition include the contribution of CSL Vifor.

The Board also retains discretion to adjust vesting outcomes considering company performance, individual performance and shareholder experience.

# About this Report

# Notes to the financial statements:

# Corporate information

CSL Limited (CSL) is a for-profit company incorporated and domiciled in Australia and limited by shares publicly traded on the Australian Securities Exchange. This financial report covers the financial statements for the consolidated entity consisting of CSL and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group). The financial report was authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of directors on 15 August 2023.

A description of the nature of the Group's operations and its principal activities is included in the directors' report.

# a. Basis of preparation

This general purpose financial report has been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards, other authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board, International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the Corporations Act 2001. It presents information on a historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments, which have been measured at fair value. Amounts have been rounded off to the nearest million dollars.

The report is presented in US dollars, because this currency is the pharmaceutical industry standard currency for reporting purposes. It is the predominant currency of the Group's worldwide sales and operating expenses.

# b. Principles of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of CSL and its subsidiaries as at 30 June 2023. CSL has control of its subsidiaries when it is exposed to, and has the rights to, variable returns from its involvement with those entities and when it has the ability to affect those returns. A list of significant controlled entities (subsidiaries) at year end is contained in Note 17.

Non-controlling interests in the financial results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and balance sheet respectively. Further details about the Group's non-controlling interest is contained in Note 23.

The financial results of the subsidiaries are prepared using consistent accounting policies and for the same reporting period as the parent company.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in full. The Group has formed a trust to administer the Group's employee share plan. This trust is consolidated as it is controlled by the Group.

# c. Foreign currency

While the presentation currency of the Group is US dollars, entities in the Group may have other functional currencies, reflecting the currency of the primary economic environment in which the relevant entity operates. The parent entity, CSL Limited, has a functional currency of US dollars.

If an entity in the Group has undertaken transactions in foreign currency, these transactions are translated into that entity's functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.

Where the functional currency of a subsidiary is not US dollars, the subsidiary's assets and liabilities are translated on consolidation to US dollars using the exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date, and its profit and loss is translated at average exchange rates. The resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income (OCI) and in the foreign currency translation reserve in equity.

# d. Other accounting policies

Significant accounting policies that summarise the measurement basis used and are relevant to an understanding of the financial statements are provided throughout the notes to the financial statements.

# e. Key judgements and estimates

In the process of applying the Group's accounting policies, a number of judgements and estimates of future events are required. Material judgements and estimates are found in the following notes:

Note 2: Business Combinations

Note 3: Revenue and Expenses Page 124

Note 4: Tax Page 127

Note 5: Inventories Page 129

Note 6: People Costs Page 130

Note 8: Intangible Assets Page 133

Note 11: Financial Risk Management

Note 15: Receivables, Contract Assets and Payables Page 148

The Group has assessed the impact of climate risk on its financial reporting. The impact assessment principally focuses on key judgement areas, being the valuation and useful lives of intangible and tangible assets and the identification and valuation of provisions and contingent liabilities. No material accounting impacts or changes to judgements or other required disclosures have resulted from the assessment. While the assessment did not have a material impact for the year ended 30 June 2023, this may change in future periods as the Group regularly updates its assessment of the impact of the lower carbon economy.

# f. The notes to the financial statements

The notes to these financial statements have been organised into logical groupings to help users find and understand the information they need. Where possible, related information has been provided in the same place. More detailed information (for example, valuation methodologies and certain reconciliations) has been placed at the rear of the document and cross-referenced where necessary. CSL has also reviewed the notes for materiality and relevance and provided additional information where it is helpful to an understanding of the Group's performance.

# g. Significant changes in the current year

The Group completed the acquisition of Vifor Pharma Ltd (CSL Vifor) on 9 August 2022. The financial results of CSL Vifor consolidated within the Group as a result represent the contribution from that date onward, and therefore not for a full twelve month period. Refer to Note 2 for details of this acquisition.

There were no significant changes in accounting policies during the year ended 30 June 2023, nor did the introduction of new accounting standards lead to any change in measurement or disclosure in these financial statements.

The Group has not adopted any accounting standards that are issued but not yet effective. Significant accounting policies that summarise the measurement basis used and are relevant to an understanding of the financial statements are provided in the annual financial report.

# Our Current Performance

# Note 1: Segment Information

The Group's segments represent strategic business units that offer different products and operate in different industries and markets. They are presented consistent with the way the CEO who is the chief operating decision-maker (CODM) monitors and assesses business performance to make resource allocation decisions.

The acquisition of CSL Vifor in August 2022, resulted in a change in which the business is monitored and assessed. The operating segments are now being measured based on the segment operating result, being the revenues and costs directly under the control of the business unit.

The Group's operating segments are:

CSL Behring – manufactures, markets and distributes plasma products, gene therapies and recombinants.

CSL Seqirus – manufactures, markets and distributes predominantly influenza related products and provides pandemic services to governments.

CSL Vifor – manufactures, markets and distributes products in the therapeutic areas of iron deficiency and nephrology.

The Group's centralised research and development ('R&D') function builds on its capabilities across the R&D value chain. The Group continues to make balanced investments in life cycle management and market development of existing and new products. Costs related to R&D are reported separately and are not allocated to the operating segments.

The Group utilises globally integrated functions to realise economies of scale. The functions include executive office, communications, finance, human resources, legal, information & technology. The costs related to these functions, as well as any other non-business unit related costs (including depreciation and amortisation of unallocated assets) are reported as General and Administration expenses and are not allocated to the operating segments.

To enable a comparison of prior year performance, 'Segment revenue and expenses' has been restated using the new segments for the prior year comparatives ended 30 June 2022.

Segment information is presented as reviewed by the CODM on a regular basis, being the underlying performance of the businesses. A reconciliation of the segment results to the AASB financials is provided within this note.

2 CSL acquired CSL Vifor in August 2022 (Note 2) and as a result the financial results represent the profit contribution from that date onward, therefore not for a full twelve month period as with other segments.  
3 Underlying results are adjusted to exclude impairment and amortisation of acquired IP, business acquisition and integration costs and unwind of the inventory fair value uplift. The reconciliation between the underlying and statutory results has been disclosed.  
4 NPATA is defined as the statutory net profit after tax before impairment and amortisation of acquired intellectual property, business acquisition and integration costs and unwind of the inventory fair value uplift. The reconciliation between NPATA to the statutory NPAT has been disclosed.  
5 The amortisation of acquired IP for the year ended 30 June 2023 is attributable to CSL Vifor (\(229m) and CSL Behring (\)6m), of which \(181m is attributable to CSL Limited shareholders. Amortisation and impairment of commercialised IP and in-development IP is reported within cost of sales and research and development expenses respectively within the statutory consolidated statement of comprehensive income and is excluded from underlying results.  
6 The unwind of the inventory fair value uplift represents the purchase price allocation adjustment recognised upon the acquisition of CSL Vifor. The unwind is reported within cost of sales within the statutory consolidated statement of comprehensive income and is excluded from underlying results. The inventory fair value uplift recognised on the date of acquisition ( $200m) has been substantially unwound during the year ended 30 June 2023 ($ 169m, of which $122m is attributable to CSL Limited shareholders).  
7 The acquisition and integration costs are associated with the acquisition of CSL Vifor (Note 2).  
8 EBITDA is defined as statutory net profit for the period before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and impairment for the respective operating segment where activities, assets and liabilities can be directly attributed to the segment. Results related to the groups centrally managed functions, impairment and amortisation of acquired IP, business acquisition related costs, tax and net finance costs are not allocated to segments. The total unallocated costs at an EBITDA level were  $2,279m for the year ended 30 June 2023 (2022:$ 1,552m). The unallocated depreciation, amortisation and impairment expenses (including acquired IP amortisation and impairment) were  $448m for the year ended 30 June 2023 (2022:$ 407m, which included the impairment of Calimmune related in-development IP of $113m).

# Note 2: Business Combinations

The Group completed the acquisition of CSL Vifor on 9 August 2022 and paid $11,665m for 100% of CSL Vifor shares (includes shares acquired in the prior year ended 30 June 2022). The Group delisted Vifor Pharma Ltd from the Swiss Stock Exchange effective 23 December 2022.

The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with AASB 3 'Business Combinations' and consequently the CSL Vifor assets acquired, and liabilities assumed, have been recorded at fair value, with any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities being recognised as goodwill. The purchase price allocation was finalised during the year ended 30 June 2023. The purchase consideration, and fair values of the net assets acquired and goodwill at the date of acquisition are as follows:

# Key Judgements and Estimates

As part of the CSL Vifor acquisition in the year ended 30 June 2023, the Group identified the assets (comprising principally launched products and post pre-clinical stage) and liabilities acquired. Attributing fair values to assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of business combinations is considered to be a key judgement. The purchase price allocation was performed with assistance from an independent valuer to advise on the valuation techniques and key assumptions in the valuation, in particular in respect of the valuation of the intangible assets and inventory.

# (a) Acquired trade receivables

The fair value of acquired trade receivables is \(422m, which approximates the gross contractual amount for trade receivables due.

# (b) Inventories

The fair value of inventories, which includes raw materials, work in progress and finished goods related to the launched products was estimated at \(459m. Acquired inventories includes a fair value adjustment related to work in progress and finished goods and was calculated as the estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell the inventory, associated margins on these activities and holding costs.

# (c) Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment principally comprises manufacturing facilities and office space. Property, plant and equipment was fair valued using a market approach.

# (d) Other financial assets

Other financial assets principally comprises investments in publicly traded securities (carried at fair value through OCI 'FVTOCI') and venture funds (carried at fair value through the profit or loss 'FVTPL'). Valuation methods and assumptions used have been disclosed in Note 11(e).

# (e) Intangible assets (excluding goodwill)

The fair value and useful lives of intangible assets at the date of acquisition were as follows:

<table><tr><td>Fair value as at the date of acquisition</td><td>US$m</td><td>Useful lives (years)</td></tr><tr><td>Commercialised products</td><td>6,494</td><td>19 – 30</td></tr><tr><td>Products in development</td><td>115</td><td>Not amortised</td></tr><tr><td>Other intangible assets (software, brand name and customer assets)</td><td>97</td><td>5 – 20</td></tr><tr><td>Total intangible assets (excluding goodwill)</td><td>6,706</td><td></td></tr></table>

Product related intangible assets are fair valued using the multi-period excess earnings method, which uses a number of estimates regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows. The key assumptions in the cash flows are sales forecast, peak year sales, revenue erosion curves and probability of success. Future milestones have been included in the valuation of product related intangibles (as a deduction of cash flows).

# (f) Provisions (including recognised contingent liabilities)

Provisions assumed include provisions for employee benefits, asset retirement obligations and onerous contracts. Provisions also include the estimated fair value of potential contingent liabilities assumed on acquisition date relating to various claims and disputes with third parties in each case where there is a possible, but not probable, future financial exposure, and involve an assessment of the likelihood of several scenarios in relation to those matters.

![](images/f217e1f81816ff3ccf84555887e858a6dcafeae1b27ef50b99fcc3a2bfdc2e9b.jpg)

# Key Judgements and Estimates

A contingent liability is a possible obligation arising from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by occurrence or non-occurrence of uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group. A contingent liability may also be a present obligation arising from past events but is not recognised on the basis that a future settlement of economic benefits is not probable. If the expected settlement of the liability becomes probable, a provision is recognised. The outcomes of litigation are inherently difficult to predict, and judgement has been applied in assessing the likely outcome of legal claims and determining which claims require recognition of a provision or disclosure of a contingent liability.

Contingent liabilities are recognised at fair value within provisions on acquisition date in connection with a business combination after consideration of a range of possible outcomes unless the economic outflows are not possible. A number of pending legal matters have been identified from the acquisition of CSL Vifor, which include matters relating to intellectual property, contractor, competitor and regulatory disputes, product liability claims and various other matters.

Management has recorded such contingent liabilities at fair value on the date of the Vifor acquisition, which requires the use of significant judgements, estimates and assumptions and is subject to uncertainty. The key estimates that may have a significant impact on the estimated contingent liability in the future reporting periods include the timing and final amounts of any payments. These uncertainties can also cause reversals in previously recognised liabilities once final settlement is reached.

# (g) Non-controlling interests

In connection with the acquisition of CSL Vifor, the Group acquired  $55\%$  of the share capital and voting rights of Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma (VFMCRP). For the non-controlling interests in VFMCRP, the Group elected to recognise the non-controlling interests at its fair value on acquisition date. The fair value was estimated by applying an income approach. The fair value estimates are based on an assumed discount rate, long-term sustainable growth rate and a control premium discount.

Further detail on the Group's non-controlling interests are disclosed in Note 23.

# (h) Goodwill

Where the fair value of the consideration paid for a business acquisition exceeds the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, the difference is treated as goodwill. The goodwill is attributable to future business growth opportunities, an assembled workforce and synergies expected to be realised from the Group's acquisition of CSL Vifor.

The acquisition of CSL Vifor resulted in the recognition of goodwill of  $6,892m. Goodwill has been allocated to each of the relevant cash generating units (CGUs) which are expected to realise the synergies from the acquisition. The recoverability of goodwill is monitored at the segment (business unit) level, represented by CSL Behring ($ 4,281m), CSL Seqirus ($911m) and CSL Vifor ($1,700m).

# (i) Deferred tax

The net deferred tax liability recognised of \(658m principally related to the deferred tax impact of the fair value uplifts on intangible assets, inventories, property, plant and equipment and recognised contingent liabilities.

# (j) Revenue and profit contribution

CSL Vifor contributed revenues of  $1,989m and segment contribution of$ 921m to the Group for the period from 9 August 2022 to 30 June 2023. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 July 2022, consolidated pro-forma revenue and segment contribution for the year ended 30 June 2023 would have been  $2,126m and$ 1,045m respectively.

# (k) Acquisition and integration costs

During the year ended 30 June 2023, the Group has incurred \(184m of acquisition and integration planning costs (pre-tax) in connection with the transaction that are primarily recognised as general and administrative expenses.

# Note 3: Revenue and Expenses

# Recognition and measurement of revenue and other income

Revenue is recognised when the Group satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of the promised good or service to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for the goods or services. Revenue from contracts with customers includes amounts in total operating revenue. Further information about each source of revenue from contracts with customers and the revenue recognition criteria follows.

Sales: Revenue is earned (constrained by variable considerations, which include returns, discounts, rebates and allowances) from the sale of products and services. Sales are recognised when performance obligations are either satisfied over time or at a point in time. Generally the supply of product under a contract with a customer will represent the satisfaction of a performance obligation at a point in time, which is when control of the product passes to the customer.

![](images/f1a50a04b01594384df663e39529461d2d9b09b7fdbe3fb3d5badd77f0a78e91.jpg)

# Key Judgements and Estimates

Significant estimates on CSL Seqirus sales returns is performed in respect of the influenza season expected to be subject to return. The estimate is performed with inputs including historical returns and customer sales data amongst other factors. With respect to CSL Behring, for contracts where the customer controls the plasma (tolling contracts) and the Group provides fractionation services, the Group recognises revenue over time as the performance obligations are satisfied based upon a percentage of completion of our fractionation services.

Royalties: Revenue from licensees of CSL intellectual property reflect a right to use the intellectual property as it exists at the point in time in which the licence is granted. Where consideration is based on sales of product by the licensee, it is recognised when the customer's subsequent sales of product occurs.

License revenue: Revenue from licensees of CSL intellectual property reflects the transfer of a right to use the intellectual property as it exists at the point in time in which the licence is transferred to the customer. Consideration is highly variable and estimated using the most likely amount method. Subsequently, the estimate is constrained until it is highly probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. Revenue is recognised as or when the performance obligations are satisfied.

Influenza pandemic facility reservation fees: Revenue from governments in return for access to influenza manufacturing facilities in the event of a pandemic. Contracts are time-based and revenue is recognised progressively over the life of the relevant contract, which aligns to the performance obligations being satisfied.

Other income: Other income is realised from activities that are outside of the ordinary business, such as the disposal of property, plant and equipment and rental income.

Revenue from contracts with customers includes amounts in total operating revenue except other income.

# Recognition and measurement of expenses

Total finance costs: Includes borrowing costs primarily related to interest expense net of a  $14m gain reclassified to the profit and loss (2022:$ 1m) in connection with Group's treasury lock arrangement and lease related interest expense. Lease related interest expense and borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred, except where finance costs are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of a qualifying asset where they are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset. Capitalised interest for qualifying assets during the year ended 30 June 2023 was $61m (2022: $27m). The weighted average interest rate applicable to capitalised borrowing costs during the year was 3.4% (2022: 2.4%). Any difference between borrowing proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income using the effective interest method.

Unrealised foreign currency losses/(gains) on debt is principally related to the Group's EUR250m and CHF400m senior unsecured notes in the US Private Placement market. The foreign currency risk related to this debt was partially hedged as a cash flow hedge.

Fair value losses on financial assets primarily relates to the Group's investments in venture funds measured at fair value through profit or loss (Note 11(e)). The resulting changes in fair value are recognised directly in profit or loss within finance costs at each reporting period.

Goods and Services Tax (GST) and other foreign equivalents: Amounts are recognised net of GST, except where GST is not recoverable from a taxation authority, in which case it is recognised as part of an asset's cost or expense.

# Note 4: Tax continued

# Current taxes

Current tax assets and liabilities are the amounts expected to be recovered from (or paid to) tax authorities, under the tax rates and laws in each jurisdiction. These include any rates or laws that are enacted or substantively enacted as at the balance sheet date.

# Deferred taxes

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences, carried forward unused tax assets and unused tax losses, only if it is probable that taxable profit will be available to utilise them.

The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at the reporting date. If it is no longer probable that taxable profit will be available to utilise them, they are reduced accordingly.

Deferred tax is measured using tax rates and laws that are enacted at the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or when the deferred income tax liability is settled.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if a legally enforceable right exists to set-off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and if they relate to the same taxable entity or group and the same taxation authority.

Income taxes attributable to amounts recognised in OCI or directly in equity are also recognised in OCI or in equity, and not in the consolidated income statement.

CSL Limited and its  $100\%$  owned Australian subsidiaries have formed a tax consolidated group effective from 1 July 2003.

# Key Judgements and Estimates

The risk of uncertain tax positions, and recognition and recoverability of deferred tax assets, are regularly assessed. To do this requires judgements about the application of income tax legislation in jurisdictions in which the Group operates and the future operating performance of entities with carry forward losses. These judgements and assumptions, which include matters such as the availability and timing of tax deductions and the application of the arm's length principle to related party transactions, are subject to risk and uncertainty. Changes in circumstances may alter expectations and affect the carrying amount of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Any resulting adjustment to the carrying value of a deferred tax item will be recorded as a credit or charge to the statement of comprehensive income.

# Raw Materials

Raw materials comprise collected and purchased plasma, chemicals, filters and other inputs to production that will be further processed into saleable products but have yet to be allocated to manufacturing.

# Work in Progress

Work in progress comprises all inventory items that are currently in use in manufacturing and intermediate products such as pastes generated from the initial stages of the plasma production process.

# Finished Products

Finished products comprise material that is ready for sale and has passed all quality control tests.

Inventories generally have expiry dates and the Group provides for product that is short-dated. Expiry dates for raw material are no longer relevant once the materials are used in production. The relevant expiry date at this point then becomes that of the resultant intermediate or finished product.

Inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost includes direct material and labour and an appropriate proportion of variable and fixed overheads. Fixed overheads are allocated on the basis of normal operating capacity.

Net realisable value is the estimated revenue that can be earned from the sale of a product less the estimated costs of both completion and selling.

The Group assesses net realisable value of plasma derived products on a basket of products basis given their joint product nature.

# Key Judgements and Estimates

Various factors affect the assessment of recoverability of the carrying value of inventory, including regulatory approvals and future demand for the Group's products. These factors are taken into account in determining the appropriate level of provisioning for inventory.

# Note 6: People Costs

# (a) Employee Benefits

Employee benefits include salaries and wages, annual leave and long-service leave, defined benefit and defined contribution plans and share-based payments incentive awards.

# Salaries and wages

Wages and salaries include non-monetary benefits, annual leave and long service leave. These are recognised and presented in different ways in the financial statements:

- The liability for annual leave and the portion of long service leave expected to be paid within twelve months is measured at the amount expected to be paid.  
- The liability for long service leave and annual leave expected to be paid after one year is measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date.

- The liability for annual leave and the portion of long service leave that has vested at the reporting date is included in the current provision for employee benefits.  
- The portion of long service leave that has not vested at the reporting date is included in the non-current provision for employee benefits.

Defined benefit pension plans provide either a defined lump sum or ongoing pension benefits for employees upon retirement, based on years of service and final average salary.

Liabilities or assets in relation to these plans are recognised in the balance sheet, measured as the present value of the obligation less the fair value of the pension fund's assets at that date.

Present value is based on expected future payments to the reporting date, calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. Past service costs are recognised in statement of comprehensive income on the earlier of the date of plan amendments or curtailment, and the date that the Group recognises restructuring related costs.

Detailed information about the Group's defined benefit plans is in Note 18(a).

# Key Judgements and Estimates

The determination of certain employee benefit liabilities requires an estimation of future employee service periods and salary levels and the timing of benefit payments. These assessments are made based on past experience and anticipated future trends. The expected future payments are discounted using the rate applicable to high quality corporate bonds. Discount rates are matched to the expected payment dates of the liabilities.

# Defined contribution plans

The Group makes contributions to various defined contribution pension plans and the Group's obligation is limited to these contributions. The amount recognised as an expense for the year ended 30 June 2023 was  $54m (2022:$ 48m).

# Equity settled share-based payment expense

Share-based payment expenses arise from plans that award long-term incentives. Detailed information about the terms and conditions of the share-based payment arrangements is presented in Note 18(b).

# Our Future

# Note 7: Research and Development

The Group conducts research and development activities to support future development of products to serve our patient communities, to enhance our existing products and to develop new therapies. All costs associated with our research and development activities are expensed as incurred as uncertainty exists up until the point of regulatory approval as to whether a research and development project will be successful. Development costs incurred after regulatory approval are expensed unless it meets the criteria to be recognised as an intangible asset.

The Group also gains control of intellectual property (IP) through acquisitions or license arrangements which are capitalised as intangible assets (Note 8).

For the year ended 30 June 2023, research and development costs recognised in the statement of comprehensive income, were $1,235m (2022: $1,156m).

# Note 8: Intangible Assets continued

# Goodwill

Any excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable net assets is recorded as goodwill. During the year ended 30 June 2023, the Group acquired CSL Vifor resulting in the recognition of goodwill valued on acquisition date of \(6,892m. Goodwill is initially allocated to a group of cash-generating units but is monitored at the segment (business unit) level. Goodwill acquired during the year ended 30 June 2023 relates to the acquisition of CSL Vifor (Note 2). The aggregate carrying amounts of goodwill by segment are as follows:

<table><tr><td></td><td>2023 US$m</td><td>2022 US$m</td></tr><tr><td>CSL Behring</td><td>5,468</td><td>1,187</td></tr><tr><td>CSL Seqirus</td><td>911</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>CSL Vifor</td><td>1,700</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Closing balance of goodwill as at 30 June</td><td>8,079</td><td>1,187</td></tr></table>

Goodwill is not amortised but is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Impairment occurs when a business unit's recoverable amount falls below the carrying value of its net assets. The results of the impairment test show that each business unit's recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value of its net assets, inclusive of goodwill. Consequently, there is no goodwill impairment as at 30 June 2023 (2022: Nil). A change in assumptions significant enough to lead to impairment is not considered a reasonable possibility.

# Intellectual property

Intellectual property acquired in a business combination is initially measured at fair value. Intellectual property internally developed or acquired separately is initially measured at cost. Following initial recognition, it is carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and impairment. Amortisation is calculated on a unit-of-production or straight-line basis over periods generally ranging from 5 to 30 years, except where it is considered that the useful economic life is indefinite. Certain intellectual property acquired may be considered to have an indefinite life.

Contingent consideration in connection with the purchase of individual assets outside of business combinations is recognised as a financial liability only when a non-contingent obligation arises (i.e. when milestone is met). The determination of whether the payment should be capitalised or expensed is usually based on the substance of the contingent payment and whether it is expected to give rise to future economic benefits that will flow to the Group. If the milestones paid are for regulatory approval and a sales target, they are likely to meet the capitalisation criteria, and would be accumulated into the cost of the intangible.

Changes in the fair value of financial liabilities from contingent consideration should be capitalised or expensed based on the nature of the asset acquired (refer above), except for changes due to interest rate fluctuations and the effect from unwinding discounts. Interest rate effects from unwinding of discounts as well as changes due to interest rate fluctuations are recognised as finance costs.

# Software

Costs incurred in developing or acquiring software, licences or systems that will contribute future financial benefits are capitalised. These include external direct costs of materials and service and direct payroll and payroll related costs of employees' time spent on the project. Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over periods generally ranging from 3 to 10 years. IT development costs include only those costs directly attributable to the development phase and are only recognised following completion of technical feasibility, where the Group has the intention and ability to use the asset.

# Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) arrangements

SaaS arrangements are service contracts providing the Group with the right to access the cloud provider's application software over the contract period. The Group applies judgement in determining the nature and the resulting accounting treatment of the costs of SaaS arrangements.

Costs incurred to configure or customise, and the ongoing fees to obtain access to the cloud provider's application software, are recognised as operating expenses when the services are received. Some of these costs incurred are for the development of software code that enhances or modifies, or creates additional capability to, existing on-premise systems and meets the definition of and recognition criteria for an intangible asset. These costs are recognised as intangible software assets and amortised over the useful life of the software.

# Recognition and measurement

The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful life of the asset on a straight-line or unit-of-production basis. Significant software intangible assets are amortised over the useful life of up to ten years. The amortisation period and method is reviewed at each financial year end at a minimum. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised. The useful life of these intangibles is reviewed each reporting period to determine whether indefinite life assessment continues to be supportable.

# Note 8: Intangible Assets continued

# Impairment of intangible assets

Assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life (including goodwill) or not yet ready for use are tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired.

An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less

costs to sell and value in use. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash generating units), other than goodwill that is monitored at the segment level.

Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash generating units, and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.

![](images/c97ced81ecc0ec8ad81ac96b6707ed7f2facaaaf093aed49af4aeffd19e45b37.jpg)

# Key Judgements and Estimates

The Group's impairment assessment requires significant judgement. Determining whether goodwill, indefinite lived intangibles and in development intangibles have been impaired requires estimation of the recoverable amount of cash generating units based on value-in-use calculations. The calculations use cash flow projections based on operating budgets and a ten-year strategic business plan, after which a terminal value, based on our view of the longer term growth profile of the business unit is applied. Cash flows have been discounted using an implied pre-tax discount rate of  $9.4\%$  (2022:  $9.0\%$ ) which is calculated with reference to external analyst views, long-term government bond rates and the Group's pre-tax cost of debt.

The determination of cash flows over the life of an asset requires judgement in assessing the future demand for the Group's products, climate related impacts, any changes in the price and cost of those products and of other costs incurred by the Group.

Factors considered in the exercise of our judgement include the progress of the research project, time to market and the anticipated competitive landscape. These factors require judgement and may change in future periods, the impairment analysis takes into account the latest available information.

# Property, plant and equipment

Land, buildings, capital work in progress and plant and equipment assets are recorded at historical cost less, where applicable, depreciation.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less accumulated depreciation, impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities and restoration obligations recognised less any lease incentives received and initial direct costs.

Depreciation is recognised on a systematic basis over the estimated useful life of the asset, generally on a straight-line basis.

Buildings 5-50 years

Plant and equipment 3-40 years

Leasehold improvements 3-25 years

Right-of-use assets

- Plasma centres 5-40 years

- Office and warehouses 1-39 years

- Land 40-101 years

The unit-of-production depreciation method, based on the expected use or output as the asset is being used, may be applied during the early stages of operation of manufacturing facilities, as a substantial period of time may be required to ramp up the production and operate at intended capacity. This method is to be applied consistently from period to period unless there is a change in the expected pattern of consumption of those future economic benefits.

Assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each reporting date. Items of property, plant and equipment are derecognised upon disposal or when no further economic benefits are expected from their use or disposal.

Impairment testing for property, plant and equipment will be performed if an impairment trigger is identified.

Gains and losses on disposals of items of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amounts and are included in the statement of comprehensive income when realised.

# Leasehold improvements

The cost of improvements to leasehold properties is amortised over the unexpired period of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvement, whichever is the shorter.

# Right-of-use assets

The Group principally has leases for plasma centres, office buildings, land, manufacturing facilities and warehouses.

Except for short-term leases and leases of low value assets, the Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). The Group accounting policy for lease liabilities has been disclosed in Note 11(d).

Unless the Group is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the underlying asset at the end of the lease term, the recognised right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term.

# Other arrangements

CSL has leased a recombinant protein facility in Lengnau to Thermo Fisher Scientific (TFS), which has a 20 year term with two five year extension options. The lease has been accounted for as an operating lease and the leased property, plant and equipment continue to be presented in the balance sheet. The total future operating lease payments due from TFS (excluding extension options and variable lease payments) were  $448m as at 30 June 2023 ($ 454m).

# Returns, Risk & Capital Management

# Note 10: Shareholder Returns

# (a) Dividends paid to CSL Limited shareholders

Dividends paid to CSL Limited shareholders are paid from the retained earnings and profits of CSL Limited, as the parent entity of the Group (Note 22). During the year, the parent entity reported profits of \(931m (2022: \)507m). The parent entity's retained earnings as at 30 June 2023 were \(6,169m (2022: \)6,323m). During the financial year \)1,085m was distributed to shareholders by way of a dividend, with a further $622m being determined as a dividend payable subsequent to the balance date.

The distribution in respect of the 2023 financial year represents a US\(2.36 dividend for FY23 on each ordinary share held.

# (b) Earnings per Share attributable to CSL Limited shareholders

CSL's basic and diluted EPS are calculated using the Group's net profit attributable to CSL Limited shareholders for the year of  $2,194m (2022:$ 2,255m). Diluted EPS differs from Basic EPS as the calculation takes into account potential ordinary shares arising from employee share plans operated by the Group.

# Note 11: Financial Risk Management

CSL holds financial instruments that arise from the Group's need to access financing, from the Group's operational activities and as part of the Group's risk management activities. The Group is exposed to financial risks associated with its financial instruments. Financial instruments comprise cash and cash equivalents, receivables, contract assets, other financial assets, payables and other liabilities, bank loans and overdrafts, unsecured notes, and lease liabilities.

The primary risks these give rise to are:

Foreign exchange risk  
- Interest rate risk  
Credit risk  
Funding and liquidity risk  
Capital management risk

Source of Risk  
Risk Mitigation  

<table><tr><td colspan="2">a. Foreign Exchange Risk</td></tr><tr><td>The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk because of its international operations. These risks relate to future commercial transactions, assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies and net investments in foreign operations.</td><td>Where possible CSL takes advantage of natural hedging (i.e. the existence of payables and receivables in the same currency). The Group also reduces its foreign exchange risk on net investments in foreign operations by denominating external borrowings in currencies that match the currencies of its foreign investments.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">b. Interest Rate Risk</td></tr><tr><td>The Group is exposed to interest rate risk through its primary financial assets and liabilities.</td><td>The Group mitigates interest rate risk on borrowings principally by entering into fixed rate arrangements, which are not subject to interest rate movements in the ordinary course. If necessary, CSL also hedges interest rate risk using derivative instruments. As at 30 June 2023 and 2022, there were no material outstanding derivative financial instruments hedging interest rate risks.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">c. Credit Risk</td></tr><tr><td>The Group is exposed to credit risk from financial instruments contracts and trade and other receivables. The maximum exposure to credit risk at reporting date is the carrying amount, net of any provision for impairment inclusive of any lifetime expected credit losses under AASB 9, if applicable, of each financial asset in the balance sheet.</td><td>The Group mitigates credit risk from financial instruments contracts by only entering into transactions with counterparties who have sound credit ratings. Given their high credit ratings, management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations. The Group minimises the credit risk associated with trade and other debtors by undertaking transactions with a large number of customers in various countries. The Group enters into arrangements with distributors to sell products in some markets. Certain distributors may contribute to 10% or more revenue of the Group. Creditworthiness of customers is reviewed prior to granting credit, using trade references and credit reference agencies.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">d. Funding and Liquidity Risk</td></tr><tr><td>The Group is exposed to funding and liquidity risk from operations and from external borrowing.
One type of this risk is credit spread risk, which is the risk that in refinancing its debt, CSL may be exposed to an increased credit spread.
Another type of this risk is liquidity risk, which is the risk of not being able to refinance debt obligations or meet other cash outflow obligations when required.
Liquidity and re-financing risks are not significant for the Group, as CSL has a prudent gearing level and strong cash flows.</td><td>The Group mitigates funding and liquidity risks by ensuring that:
• The Group has sufficient funds on hand to achieve its working capital and investment objectives
• The Group focuses on improving operational cash flow and maintaining a strong balance sheet
• The Group from time to time enters into non-recourse receivable factoring arrangements with unrelated entities to optimise cash
• Short-term liquidity, long-term liquidity and crisis liquidity requirements are effectively managed, minimising the cost of funding and maximising the return on any surplus funds through efficient cash management
• The Group has adequate flexibility to balance short-term liquidity needs, long-term core funding and in minimise refinancing risk</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">e. Capital Risk Management</td></tr><tr><td>The Group&#x27;s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern while providing returns to shareholders and benefits to other stakeholders. Capital is defined as the amount subscribed by shareholders to the Company&#x27;s ordinary shares and amounts advanced by debt providers to any Group entity.</td><td>The Group aims to maintain a capital structure, which reflects the use of a prudent level of debt funding. The aim is to reduce the Group&#x27;s cost of capital without adversely affecting the credit margins applied to the Group&#x27;s debt funding. Each year the Directors determine the dividend taking into account factors such as profitability and liquidity.</td></tr></table>

# Note 11: Financial Risk Management continued

# Risk management approach

The Group uses sensitivity analysis (together with other methods) to measure the extent of financial risks and decide if they need to be mitigated. If so, the Group's policy is to use derivative financial instruments, such as foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swap and forward contracts, to support its objective of achieving financial targets while seeking to protect future financial security. The aim is to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations in currency or interest rates on the Group's earnings. Derivatives are exclusively used for this purpose and not as trading or other speculative instruments.

# a. Foreign Exchange Risk

The objective is to match the contracts with committed future cash flows from sales and purchases in foreign currencies to protect the Group against exchange rate movements. The Group reduces its foreign exchange risk on net investments in foreign operations by denominating external borrowings in currencies that match the currencies of forecasted sales. There are no material outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts at 30 June 2023 and 2022.

# Sensitivity analysis - USD values

# Profit after tax - sensitivity to general movement of  $1\%$

Monetary items, including financial asset and liabilities, denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of an operation are revalued at the end of each reporting period to US dollar equivalents and the associated gain or loss is taken to the profit or loss. The following chart is based on decreasing the actual rate of US Dollars to AUD, EUR, CHF, GBP and CNY as at 30 June 2023 and 2022 by  $1\%$  and applying these adjusted rates to the net monetary assets/ liabilities denominated in foreign currency of various Group entities. Amounts shown are rounded to the nearest US$m.

FX Sensitivity on Profit after tax (US$m)

# Equity - sensitivity to general movement of  $1\%$

Where the functional currency of a subsidiary is not US dollars, the subsidiary's assets and liabilities are translated on consolidation to US dollars using the exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date, and its profit and loss is translated at average exchange rates. All resulting exchange differences are recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve in equity. The following chart is based on decreasing the actual exchange rate of US Dollars to AUD, EUR, CHF, GBP and CNY as at 30 June 2023 and 2022 by  $1\%$  and applying these adjusted rates to the net assets/liabilities (excluding investments in subsidiaries) of the foreign currency denominated financial statements of various Group entities. Amounts shown are rounded to the nearest US$m.

FX Sensitivity on Equity (US$m)

# b. Interest Rate Risk

As at 30 June 2023, it is estimated that a general movement of one percentage point in the interest rates applicable to investments of cash and cash equivalents would have changed the Group's profit after tax by approximately  $10m (2022:$ 10m). This calculation is based on applying a  $1\%$  movement to the total of the Group's cash and cash equivalents at year end.

As at 30 June 2023, it is estimated that a general movement of one percentage point in the interest rates applicable to floating rate unsecured bank loans would have changed the Group's profit after tax by approximately  $22m (2022:$ 4m). This calculation is based on applying a 1% movement to the total of the Group's floating rate unsecured bank loans at year end.

# Note 11: Financial Risk Management continued

Government or government-backed entities (such as hospitals) often account for a significant proportion of trade receivables. As a result, the Group carries receivables from a number of Southern European governments. The credit risk associated with trading in these countries is considered on a country-by-country basis and the Group's trading strategy is adjusted accordingly. The factors taken into account in determining the credit risk of a particular country include recent trading experience, current economic and political conditions and the likelihood of continuing support from agencies such as the European Central Bank.

17 The 144A senior unsecured notes were reclassified to non-current during the year ended 30 June 2023 aligned to the removal of a mandatory redemption feature in connection with the acquisition of CSL Vifor (Note 2).

# Note 11: Financial Risk Management continued

# Interest-bearing liabilities and borrowings

Interest-bearing liabilities and borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing liabilities and borrowings are stated at amortised cost, with any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value recognised in the statement of comprehensive income over the period of the borrowings.

Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities that are yield related are included as part of the carrying amount of the loans and borrowings. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date.

# Lease liabilities

At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate of the lessee at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. The Group exercises judgement when determining the incremental borrowing rate based on the interest that the lessee would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment, and observable inputs such as market interest rates are used as applicable.

The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as an expense in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs. Subsequent to initial recognition, lease liabilities are measured at amortised cost. Lease liabilities are remeasured if there is a modification, such as a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset.

The Group's lease liabilities are inclusive of extension options the Group is reasonably certain to exercise based upon our judgement as at the lease commencement date. After the lease commencement date, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise (or not to exercise) the option to renew (e.g. a change in business strategy).

The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option. It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption, which relates to leases such as office photocopiers, gas storage cylinders, and other miscellaneous low value assets. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

# Contractual maturities of financial liabilities

The following table categorises the financial liabilities into relevant maturity periods, taking into account the remaining period at the reporting date and the contractual maturity date. The weighted average contractual maturity date of financial liabilities (excluding trade and other payables and lease liabilities) as at 30 June 2023 is 9 years (2022: 12 years). The amounts disclosed represent principal and interest cash flows, so they may differ from the equivalent reported amounts in the balance sheet.

# e. Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities

The carrying value of financial assets and liabilities approximates fair value, with the exception of the Group's fixed interest rate debt. The following methods and assumptions were used to determine the fair values of financial assets and liabilities.

# Cash

The carrying value of cash equals fair value, due to the liquid nature of cash.

# Receivables, contract assets and payables

Carrying value of receivables, contract assets and payables with a remaining life of less than one year is deemed to equal fair value.

# Other financial assets

Other financial assets includes equity securities (publicly traded securities) carried at fair value through OCI (FVTOCI) which are not held for trading. The value of the publicly traded securities depends on the share price quoted on the corresponding stock exchange. Other financial assets also includes investments in venture funds which are not publicly traded carried at fair value through the profit or loss (FVTPL). The value of the venture funds depends on the net asset value of the underlying investments and not directly on a share index.

# Interest-bearing and other financial liabilities

The carrying amount of the interest-bearing liabilities approximates the fair value, with the exception of the Group's fixed interest rate debt. At 30 June 2023, the total fixed rate debt (excluding lease liabilities) has a carrying amount of  $7,353m (FY22:$ 7,605m) and a fair value of $6,684m (FY22: $7,300m). Fair value is calculated based on the discounted expected principal and interest cash flows, using rates currently available for debt of similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.

The Group also has foreign currency loans payable that have been designated as a cash flow hedge against forecast sale transactions in foreign currency. An effective hedge is one that meets certain criteria. Gains or losses on the cash flow hedge that relate to the effective portion of the hedge are recognised in equity. Gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion, if any, are recognised in the profit or loss. Other financial liabilities also include contingent consideration liabilities from business combinations.

# Key Judgements and Estimates

Contingent consideration liabilities are valued with reference to our judgement of the expected probability and timing of potential future milestone payments, based upon level 3 inputs under the fair value hierarchy, which is then discounted to a present value using appropriate discount rates with reference to the Group's incremental borrowing rates.

# Valuation of financial instruments

Financial instruments measured and carried at fair value are categorised as follows:

- Level 1: Items traded with quoted prices in active markets for identical liabilities  
- Level 2: Items with significantly observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets  
- Level 3: Items with unobservable inputs (not based on observable market data)

There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the year, or any transfers into Level 3.

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. Where the Group reacquires its own shares, those shares are cancelled. No gain or loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income and the consideration paid to acquire the shares, including transaction costs net of income taxes is recognised directly as a reduction in equity.

Ordinary shares receive dividends as declared and, in the event of winding up the company, participate in the proceeds from the sale of all surplus assets in proportion to the number of and amounts paid up on shares held. Ordinary shares entitle their holder to one vote, either in person or proxy, at a meeting of the company.

Share buy-backs were undertaken at higher prices than the original subscription prices which reduced the historical balance for ordinary share contributed equity to nil. The share buy-back reserve was created to reflect the excess value of shares bought over the original amount of subscribed capital. Information relating to changes in contributed equity is set out in Note 10.

# Nature and purpose of reserves

# i. Share-based payments reserve

The share-based payments reserve is used to recognise the fair value of awards issued to employees.

# ii. Foreign currency translation reserve

Where the functional currency of a subsidiary is not US dollars, its assets and liabilities are translated on consolidation to US dollars using the exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date, and its profit and loss is translated at average exchange rates.

All resulting exchange differences are recognised in OCI and in the foreign currency translation reserve in equity. Exchange differences arising from borrowings designated as hedges of net investments in foreign entities are also included in this reserve.

# iii. Hedge reserve

The hedge reserve recognises the effective portion of gains and losses on derivatives that are designated and qualify as hedges. Amounts are subsequently reclassified into the profit and loss as appropriate. The hedge reserve includes the cash flow hedge reserve associated with the T-lock which settled during the prior year ended 30 June 2022.

# iv. Other reserves

The Group has elected to recognise changes in the fair value of the investments in publicly traded securities through OCI (excluding dividend income) (Note 11(e)). These changes are accumulated within the other reserves. The Group transfers amounts from this reserve to retained earnings when the relevant equity securities are derecognised (or triggered by a change of control including the acquisition of CSL Vifor).

# Note 13: Commitments and Contingencies

# (a) Capital Commitments

Commitments in relation to capital expenditure contracted but not provided for in the financial statements are payable as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan="3"></td><td colspan="2">Capital Commitments</td></tr><tr><td>2023</td><td>2022</td></tr><tr><td>US$m</td><td>US$m</td></tr><tr><td>Not later than one year</td><td>411</td><td>403</td></tr><tr><td>Later than one year but not later than five years</td><td>84</td><td>83</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>495</td><td>486</td></tr></table>

# (b) Contingent assets and liabilities

# Litigation

In the ordinary course of business, the Group is exposed to contingent liabilities related to litigation for breach of contract and other claims. Contingent liabilities occur when the possibility of a future settlement of economic benefits is considered to be less than probable but more likely than remote. If the expected settlement of the liability becomes probable, a provision is recognised. Where appropriate, contingent liabilities are recognised at fair value on acquisition date in connection with a business combination (Note 2).

# Other contingent assets and liabilities

The Group has entered into collaboration arrangements, including in-licensing arrangements with various companies. Such collaboration agreements may require the Group to make payments on achievement of stages of development, launch or revenue milestones and may include variable payments that are based on unit sales or profit (e.g. royalty and profit share payments). The amount of variable payments under the arrangements are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict, given the direct link to future sales, profit levels and the range of outcomes.

The maximum potential unrecognised future milestone payments could amount to  $7,952m in the event each related product reached its full commercial potential (2022:$ 2,050m). These amounts are undiscounted and are not risk-adjusted, which include all such possible payments that can arise assuming all products currently in development are successful and all possible performance objectives are met.

The increase in potential milestone payments during the year includes commitments assumed from the acquisition of CSL Vifor (Note 2) and the collaboration and license agreement with Arcturus Therapeutics. The arrangement with Arcturus Therapeutics was entered into by the Group during the year in order to access their late stage self-amplifying mRNA (sa-mRNA) vaccine platform technology. Payments in connection with the transaction was paid to Arcturus during the year ended 30 June 2023, which has been recognised as an intangible asset (Note 8). The arrangement requires the Group to make payments on achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones, as well as royalties and future profit share arrangements.

The Group also has certain take or pay arrangements with contract manufacturers or service providers which serve as commercial manufacturers and suppliers for certain products. To the extent a commitment is determined to be onerous, these are provided for within provisions in the consolidated balance sheet.

Cash and cash equivalents are held for the purpose of meeting short term cash commitments rather than for investment or other purposes. They are made up of:

Cash on hand.  
- At call deposits with banks or financial institutions.  
- Investments in money market instruments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.

For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash at the end of the financial year is net of bank overdraft amounts.

Cash flows are presented on a gross basis. The GST component of cash flows arising from investing and financing activities that are recoverable from or payable to a taxation authority are presented as part of operating cash flows.

Receivables are initially recorded at their transaction price and are generally due for settlement within 30 to 60 days from date of invoice. Collectability is regularly reviewed at an operating unit level.

A provision for expected credit losses (ECL) is recognised based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. Cash flows relating to short-term receivables are not discounted if the effect of discounting is immaterial. When a trade receivable for which a provision for expected credit loss has been recognised becomes uncollectible in a subsequent period, it is written off against the provision.

ECLs are recognised in two stages. For credit exposures for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the next 12-months (a 12-month ECL). For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is required for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default (a lifetime ECL).

For trade receivables and contract assets, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment.

# Note 15: Receivables, Contract Assets and Payables continued

# Key Judgements and Estimates

In applying the Group's accounting policy to trade and other receivables with governments and related entities in South Eastern Europe as set out in Note 11, significant judgement is involved in assessing the expected credit loss of trade or other receivable amounts. Matters considered include recent trading experience, current economic and political conditions and the likelihood of continuing support from agencies such as the European Central Bank.

As at 30 June 2023, receivables totalling  $286m (2022:$ 16m) had been sold as part of the Group's non-recourse receivable factoring arrangements. The receivables were derecognised upon sale as substantially all risks and rewards associated with the receivables passed to the purchaser.

Contract assets and deferred revenue (contract liabilities): The completion of performance obligations often differs from contract payment schedules. A contract asset is initially recognised for revenue earned from satisfying a performance obligation. However, the receipt of consideration is conditional upon the full satisfaction of the performance obligation within the contract. Upon completing the full performance obligation, the amount recognised as contract assets is reclassified to trade receivables. Amounts billed in accordance with customer contracts, but where the Group had not yet provided a good or service, are recorded and presented as part of deferred revenue. Deferred revenue is recognised as revenue when the Group performs under the contract.

Other current receivables are recognised and carried at the nominal amount due upon an unconditional right to payment. Non-current receivables are recognised and carried at amortised cost. They are non-interest bearing and have various repayment terms.

Trade payables, accruals and other payables: Represents the notional amounts owed to suppliers for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of the financial year that are unpaid. Trade and other payables are non-interest bearing and have various repayment terms but are usually paid within 30 to 60 days of recognition.

Receivables and payables include the amount of GST receivable or payable. The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, taxation authorities is included in other receivables or payables in the balance sheet.

Contingent consideration associated with business combinations: The Group's recognised contingent consideration principally relates to Vitaeris and CSL Vifor's past business combinations. These liabilities are recorded as non-current financial liabilities at fair value, which are then remeasured at each subsequent reporting date at fair value through profit and loss.

The fair value estimations typically depend on factors such as technical milestones or market performance, and are adjusted for the probability of their likelihood of potential future payments, and are appropriately discounted to reflect the impact of time. Refer to Note 11 for further details on the fair value measurement. As at 30 June 2023, the maximum amount of undiscounted potential future milestone payments relating to historical business combinations are  $470m (2022:$ 470m).

Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities in subsequent periods are recognised in research and development expenses for early-stage products and as cost of sales for currently marketed products. The effect of unwinding the discount over time for contingent consideration carried at fair value is recognised as finance costs.

Provisions are recognised when all three of the following conditions are met:

- The Group has a present or constructive obligation arising from a past transaction or event  
- It is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation  
- A reliable estimate can be made of the obligation.

Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. Provisions recognised reflect our best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows to settle the obligation at a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.

Provisions for employee benefits includes the liability for leave entitlements, related on costs and restructuring costs where required. Other provisions include provisions for asset retirement obligations and onerous contracts. Other provisions also include the estimated fair value of potential contingent liabilities assumed on business acquisition date relating to various claims and disputes with third parties in each case where there is a possible, but not probable, future financial exposure, and involve an assessment of the likelihood of several scenarios in relation to those matters.

In addition to the plans listed, CSL Behring GmbH, CSL Behring Innovation GmbH and Seqirus GmbH employees are members of multi-employer plans administered by an unrelated third party. CSL Behring GmbH, CSL Behring Innovation GmbH, Seqirus GmbH and their employees make contributions to the plans and receive pension entitlements on retirement. Participating employers may have to make additional contributions in the event that the plans have insufficient assets to meet their obligations. However, there is insufficient information available to determine this amount on an employer by employer basis. The contributions made by CSL Behring GmbH, CSL Behring Innovation GmbH and Seqirus GmbH are determined by the Plan Actuary and are designed to be sufficient to meet the obligations of the plans based on actuarial assumptions. Contributions made by CSL Behring GmbH, CSL Behring Innovation GmbH and Seqirus GmbH are expensed in the year in which they are made.

25 The CSL Behring AG and CSL Vifor pension plans have asset surplus' not recognised on the basis that future economic benefits are not available to the entity in the form of a reduction in future contributions or a cash refund. The plan assets have been recognised up to the asset ceiling limit.

# Note 18: Detailed Information – People Costs continued

# Movements in accrued benefits and assets

During the financial year the value of accrued benefits increased by \(516m, mainly attributable to:

Service costs charged to the profit and loss of \(53m;  
- Interest costs of \(24m, from the discount rate on benefit obligations and anticipated benefit payments;  
- Employee contributions of $24m;  
- Unfavourable foreign currency movements of \(68m taken directly to the Foreign Currency Translation Reserve;  
- Offsetting these movements were decreases from:

- Benefits paid by the plans of \(48m;  
- Actuarial adjustments, generating a decrease in accrued benefits of $33m.

During the financial year, plan assets increased by \(502m, mainly attributable to:

- CSL Vifor plan assets acquired on acquisition date of  $\$ {424}\mathrm{\;m}$  ;  
Employer and employee contributions of  $69m and investment returns that increased plan assets by$ 21m;  
- Favourable foreign currency movements of $56m taken directly to the Foreign Currency Translation Reserve;  
- Favourable asset ceiling movements of $9m;  
- Offsetting these movements were decreases from:

# (b) Share-based payments

# Long Term Incentives

A face value equity allocation methodology, being a five day volume weighted average share price based on the market price of a CSL share at the time of grant, is used to determine the number of units granted to a participant under each of the shared based payment plans, which are as follows:

- The Executive Performance and Alignment Plan (EPA) grants Performance Share Units (PSU) to qualifying executives. Vesting is subject to continuing employment, satisfactory performance and the achievement of absolute return measures. The return measures include EPS growth and seven-year average Return on Invested Capital (ROIC).  
- The Retain and Grow Plan (RGP) grants Restricted Share Units (RSU) to qualifying employees, participation in the RGP plan is broader than in the EPA plan. Vesting is subject to continuing employment and satisfactory performance.

EPA and RGP grants made prior to 1 September 2021 vest in equal tranches on the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the grant. EPA grants made from 1 September 2021 vest on the third anniversary. RGP grants made from 1 September 2021 vest in equal tranches on the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant. For EPA and RGP commencement benefit awards, vesting dates will vary. There have been no changes to the grant terms of any existing instruments.

The fair value of the awards granted is estimated at the date of grant using an adjusted form of the Black-Scholes model, considering the terms and conditions upon which the PSUs and RSUs were granted. There is no exercise price payable on PSUs and RSUs. The following grants were issued during the year ended 30 June 2023:

<table><tr><td>Date of grant</td><td>PSUs</td><td>RSUs</td></tr><tr><td>1 September 2022</td><td>411</td><td>781,314</td></tr><tr><td>1 November 2022</td><td>210,065</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>1 March 2023</td><td>5,779</td><td>121,093</td></tr></table>

The relevant tranche of PSUs will exercise upon vesting between September 2024 and September 2025. The relevant tranche of RSUs will exercise upon vesting between September 2023 and September 2025.

# The Non-Executive Directors Plan

The Non-Executive Directors (NED) pay a minimum of  $20\%$  of their pre-tax base fee in return for a grant of rights, each right entitling a NED to acquire one CSL share at no cost (shares purchased on market). There is a nominated restriction period of three to fifteen years, after which the NED will have access to their shares. On 25 August 2022, 3,135 rights were granted under the NED Rights Plan with vesting through to August 2023.

# Global Employee Share Plan

The Global Employee Share Plan (GESP) allows employees to make contributions from post-tax salary up to a maximum of A$12,000 (or equivalent) per six month contribution period. Employees receive shares at a 15% discount to the applicable market rate over the five day period up to and including the first and last ASX trading days of the six month period, whichever is the lower.

# Recognition and measurement

The fair value of awards granted are recognised as an employee benefit expense with a corresponding increase in equity. Fair value is independently measured at grant date and recognised over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the award.

Fair value is independently determined using a combination of the Binomial and Black-Scholes valuation methodologies, including Monte Carlo simulation, considering the terms and conditions on which the awards were granted. The fair value of the awards granted excludes the impact of any non-market vesting conditions, which are included in assumptions about the number of awards that are expected to vest.

At each reporting date, the number of awards that are expected to vest is revised. The employee benefit expense recognised each period considers the most recent estimate of the number of awards that are expected to vest. No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except where the vesting is conditional upon a market condition and that market condition is not met. The Group does not have any awards with a market condition as at 30 June 2023.

# Independent auditor's report to the members of CSL Limited

# Report on the audit of the financial report

# Opinion

We have audited the financial report of CSL Limited (the Company) and its subsidiaries (collectively the Group), which comprises the consolidated balance sheet as at 30 June 2023, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies, and the directors' declaration.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial report of the Group is in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, including:

a. Giving a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 30 June 2023 and of its consolidated financial performance for the year ended on that date; and  
b. Complying with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Regulations 2001.

# Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial report section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board's APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the Code) that are relevant to our audit of the financial report in Australia. We have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

# Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial report of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, but we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.

We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial report section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying financial report.

# Existence and valuation of inventories

# Why significant

At 30 June 2023, the Group holds inventories of $5,466 million which are recorded at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

The Group's accounting for inventories is complex due to the nature of products being manufactured requiring multiple inputs into the determination of cost and the need to ensure the effect of inventory sales within the Group is appropriately considered in the determination of cost.

Provisions may be recognised in relation to all components of inventories, including raw materials, work in progress and finished goods in considering whether inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The Group considers a number of factors when determining the appropriate level of inventory provisioning, including expiry dates, current selling prices and achieved margins.

Due to the significant value of inventories, global distribution, intra-group transactions and the judgements involved in determining whether inventory is carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value, the existence and valuation of inventories was considered a key audit matter.

The Group's disclosures with respect to inventories are included in Note 5 of the financial report.

# How our audit addressed the key audit matter

We have assessed the carrying value of inventories, including the determination of cost and provisions required to ensure inventory is carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value at 30 June 2023.

We assessed the appropriateness of the determination of inventory cost by assessing the accuracy of the standard cost approach used by the Group and assessing the recognition of variances from those standard costs.

We assessed the elimination of any unrealised profits on sales of inventories between group entities and resultant tax consequences by the Group.

We assessed whether inventory is recognised at the lower of cost and net realisable value at period end by comparing the inventory value measured at cost to evidence supporting net realisable value such as the current selling prices and achieved margins.

We considered whether the Group's inventory provisioning policy appropriately identified and considered the obsolescence and expiration of inventory. We assessed the mathematical accuracy of the Group's provisioning calculations, recalculated inventory provisions in line with Group policy and considered any specific inventory valuation risks identified through our inventory cost, NRV and observation procedures.

We assessed the Group's stock taking procedures which included attendance at periodic cycle counts or through attendance at year-end inventory stocktakes in locations with significant inventory holdings. We remained alert for obsolescence issues during our observation of physical inventories.

We have assessed the Group's disclosures with respect to inventories in Note 5 of the financial report.

# CSL Vifor Acquisition

# Why significant

On 9 August 2022, the Group received the final regulatory approval for the acquisition of Vifor Pharma Group (now CSL Vifor) and obtained control effective from that date.

The total consideration paid by the Group amounted to \(11,665 million as disclosed in Note 2.

Accounting for this transaction required the Group to exercise significant judgement to determine the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities assumed, in particular the identification and valuation of intangible assets and inventory.

The Group's disclosures with respect to this acquisition are included in Note 2 of the financial report.

# How our audit addressed the key audit matter

We read the underlying transaction agreements to gain an understanding of the key terms and conditions and assessed whether the Group accounting treatment appropriately reflected these transaction conditions and complied with the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.

We assessed the appropriateness of the criteria used for the determination of the acquisition date and the total consideration paid.

We considered the values ascribed by the Group to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at acquisition date. With the assistance of our valuation specialists, we assessed the:

- reasonableness of the valuation assumptions used by the internal and external experts in their determination of fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities

# Why significant

# How our audit addressed the key audit matter

- competence, qualifications and objectivity of the internal and external experts; and  
whether the fair values were appropriately recorded in the financial report.

We recalculated the value of residual goodwill and assessed the reasonableness of the Group's allocation of goodwill to its cash generating units.

Our tax specialists in Australia and Switzerland considered the Group's accounting for the taxation impacts of the transaction.

We assessed the adequacy of the financial report disclosures in Note 2.

# Information other than the financial report and auditor's report thereon

The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Company's 2023 annual report other than the financial report and our auditor's report thereon. We obtained the directors' report that at is to be included in the annual report, prior to the date of this auditor's report, and we expect to obtain the remaining sections of the annual report after the date of this auditor's report.

Our opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon, with the exception of the Remuneration Report and our related assurance opinion.

In connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial report or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed on the other information obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of the directors for the financial report

The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters relating to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

# Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial report

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.

As part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

$\triangleright$  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.  
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.  
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.  
Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.  
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the disclosures, and whether the financial report represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.  
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

Building a better working world

We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

From the matters communicated to the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial report of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# Report on the audit of the Remuneration Report

# Opinion on the Remuneration Report

We have audited the Remuneration Report included in the directors' report for the year ended 30 June 2023.

In our opinion, the Remuneration Report of CSL Limited for the year ended 30 June 2023, complies with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001.

# Responsibilities

The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Remuneration Report in accordance with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Remuneration Report, based on our audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards.
