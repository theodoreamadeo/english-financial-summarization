# MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION

# AND ANALYSIS

# OVERVIEW OF GROUP'S BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS

In financial year ("FY") 2023, the nation experienced a slower growth. While the reported headline inflation eased in FY2023, the market and businesses continued to see pressure from increase in material prices and cost of labour. The Group witnessed a gradual improvement in the property sector during this period amidst the challenges faced while the general market sentiment remained soft.

In FY2023, the Group launched a residential project, namely, Aster Hill. The total property sales for UOA

Development Bhd and its subsidiaries (the "Group") amounted to approximately RM827.3 million where approximately  $67\%$  of the properties sold were in the residential segment and  $33\%$  were in the commercial segment. Revenue for the financial year was derived from both the progressive recognition of on-going development projects and sales of inventories. The continued improvement in rental income and the hospitality segment had also contributed to the Group's income during the year.

Summary of the Group's financial and share price performance for the past five (5) years:

# REVIEW OF FINANCIAL RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

In FY2023, the Group recorded a total revenue from property development of RM399.4 million and a profit after tax and minority interests ("PATAMI") of RM279.6 million.

Compared to the previous financial year, the Group's revenue in FY2023 was lower at RM399.4 million, compared to RM451.7 million. The decrease in revenue was mainly due to lower progressive recognition from on-going development projects which was partially offset by higher sales of inventories.

The Group registered a PATAMI of RM279.6 million in FY2023, compared to RM219.9 million in the previous financial year. The increase in PATAMI was mainly attributable to the higher other income of RM354.3 million (FY2022: RM247.4 million) and fair value gains on investment properties of RM39.4 million.

Other income rose to RM354.3 million in FY2023 from RM247.4 million in the preceding financial year, mainly due to higher rental income and income from the

Group's hospitality division. The increase in rental income which formed a substantial part of other income was a result driven by improvements in rental across most of our rental assets, particularly in the office segment. Income from the hospitality division also saw an increase compared to the previous financial year, attributed to the normalisation of international travel after the gradual reopening of international borders in FY2022 post-pandemic, and improvement in conferences and events hosting. Corresponding to the rise in income from the hospitality division, the administrative and general expenses increased to RM269.0 million from RM202.0 million in preceding financial year.

As at 31 December 2023, the cash and cash equivalents remained robust at RM1.8 billion. The balance sheet remained strong, with a net cash position enabling potential development of investment properties and acquisitions of land development when opportunities arise.

# MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)

# CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS

# ANTICIPATED / KNOWN RISKS AND MOVING FORWARD

As we move into FY2024, the Group maintains a cautious outlook on the property sector given prevailing soft market sentiments, economic uncertainties and prolonged geopolitical conflicts. Risks on rising construction and material costs and potential increases in the overnight policy rate may further impact market conditions and dampen business confidence and consumer sentiments.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/09143171-b0cc-400f-8440-f9b9008e38d5/ce15b5f4726f7b85814d3830fb788f2e587693467050bf0c8ad576a4cc0961bf.jpg)

Aster Hill is a residential development located adjacent to our completed project, Aster Green Residence, within the established township of Sri Petaling and it consists of two 32-storey residential towers with a total of 1,150 units. The combined Gross Development Value (GDV) of these projects is approximately RM1.0 billion. Both projects are slated for completion in FY2026.

# UPCOMING/FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS

Duo Tower is the newest Grade A office building located in Bangsar South, supported by well-established amenities and connectivity. It consists of two blocks of office towers, with a 34-storey Tower A accommodating a total of 239 office units and a 38-storey Tower B with more than 700,000 square feet of letable area. This project commenced construction in FY2023 and it is slated for launch in the first half of FY2024, with expected completion in FY2027.

Despite the challenges, the Group remains focused on future development projects in targeted strategic locations with carefully timed launches that aligned with the economic and market conditions.

As a return to the shareholders, the Group maintains its dividend policy of paying  $30\%$  to  $50\%$  of realised PATAMI.

# OUR SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH

Here at U0A, our approach to sustainability is driven by our Sustainability Policy ("Policy"). The Policy is built upon our sustainability framework that encompasses EESG considerations as its core pillars, all of which are aligned with the UNSDGs we have identified as the most relevant to our material topics, business strategies, principal risks, stakeholder influence and effects on our community. Out of the seventeen (17) UNSDGs, we have

adopted four (4) of them.

We strive to integrate EESG considerations into our daily operations and business management. This involves promoting our sustainability principles and practises: Awareness, Understanding, Commitment, Action, Assessment, and Monitoring, among our leaders and stakeholders, to achieve our sustainability goals.

# MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT

In the year under review, we have reviewed and realigned FY2023's material topics based on Bursa Malaysia Sustainability Reporting Guide 3rd Edition, their toolkits, EESG indicators and GRI Standards. As part of this realignment, we removed 'Risk Management' and 'Ethics and Compliance' from this section and instead have this included in the Corporate Governance Statement. We also combined 'Product and Service Quality', 'Customer Satisfaction and Relationship', 'Financial Performance' and 'Indirect Economic Impact' and renamed it as 'Economic Performance'. Similarly too, 'Technology Innovation and Development' and 'Cybersecurity and Information Technology' are combined into 'Technology, Digital Innovation and Cybersecurity'. We introduced 'Sustainable Design, Green Space and Biodiversity', 'Anti-Corruption' and 'Water Management' as new material topics.

Our SCWG continuously monitor the business's environment

and engage various stakeholders on an ongoing basis to ensure we have appropriately recognised the risks and opportunities presented by our operating environment, the needs of our stakeholders, as well as manage our material sustainability areas. We considered the following:

i. Issues that matter to UOA's business performance  
ii. Issues that matter to UOA's stakeholders  
iii. Issues that presently have or could potentially have an impact on UOA

Subsequently, this initial analysis underwent refinement to pinpoint sustainability aspects of significance, guided by:

i. The significance of UOA's economic, environmental, and social impacts, and  
ii. The influence on stakeholders' assessments and decisions.

# MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT

The materiality matrix below illustrates thirteen (13) material topics aligned along the x-axis to indicate their significance of our economic, environmental, and social impacts.

Simultaneously, these topics are positioned along the y-axis to reflect their influence on stakeholder assessments decisions concerning our business engagements.

# OUR INDIRECT ECONOMIC IMPACT

# Cumulative Infrastructure Investments

UOA recognises the importance of community involvement in the areas where we operate. Hence, UOA continues to improve the quality life of local communities through constructing or upgrading surrounding amenities and infrastructure where necessary.

# Bamboo Hills Retail Space

In FY2022, we completed one (1) amenity project, Bamboo Hills with a total cost of RM 83.5 million. The newly created retail spaces has enhanced the residential areas of Taman Bamboo in Jalan Ipoh. Bamboo Hills will also indirectly contributed to the economy of the neighbourhood through the creation of new job opportunities.

# Bamboo Hills Highway Access

To ensure connectivity for the future community of Bamboo Hills, we built a direct access from Bamboo Hills to DUKE Highway.

# Segambut 2 Railway Station

The upcoming construction of Segambut 2 Railway Station, located next to the United Point Residence development, is a hallmark of the Transit-Oriented Development ("TOD") concept that will provide the residents from United Point Residence and nearby areas the opportunity to utilise the rail service as the main mode of transport.

On 24 August 2023, the Development Agreement for the construction of the railway station between Railway Assets Corporation ("RAC") and IDP Industrial Development Sdn Bhd ("IDP") was signed between Chief Executive Officer of RAC, Azhar bin Ahmad and Director of IDP, Kong Pak Lim. The signing ceremony was witnessed by Transport Minister YB Loke Siew Fook, Minister of Youth & Sports and Segambut Member of Parliament YB Hannah Yeoh, and Deputy Transport Minister Datuk Haji Hasbi bin Hj Habibollah.

By introducing rail connectivity as the transport mode of choice in the area, it will reduce road congestion and encourage home ownership among those who want to live or work near the city centre. Slated for completion in year 2026, the station is also expected to provide a conducive and comfortable experience for commuters with modern facilities including lifts, escalators, a pedestrian overpass, covered walkway, car and motorcycle parking spots, as well as bus, taxi stops and passengers pick-up/drop-off areas.

- Accomplishing quality objectives by establishing, implementing, maintaining and continuously improving the QMS which complies with the applicable requirements.

As part of our continuous improvement efforts, UOA determines and selects opportunities for improvement and implements necessary actions to meet customers' requirements and enhance customer satisfaction.

# Examples:

- Improving products and services pursuant to survey feedbacks to meet requirements as well as to address future needs and expectations,  
- Correcting, preventing and reducing undesired effects, and  
- Improving the performance and effectiveness of the QMS.

UOA initiates actions to continually improve the suitability, adequacy and effectiveness of the QMS. Continual improvement techniques and processes are applied to areas of the business that have an impact on the quality of our products and services. We analyse and take necessary actions on results of project improvements projects as well as outputs from our Management Review.

For product quality, we benchmark ourselves against the Quality Assessment System in Construction ("QLASSIC") certified by the Construction Industry Development Board ("CIDB"), measuring workmanship quality based on Construction Industry Standards (CIS 7:2014), ensuring adherence to high standards.

# SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT

As a leading property developer, our collaboration with vendors, spanning suppliers, contractors, and consultants, is fundamental to the continuity of business and ensures product quality. However, we recognise the risk of illegal workers in our supply chain, which poses legal and reputational threats. To address this, we conduct due diligence, including on-site visits, to ensure proper authorisation for work in Malaysia.

Our supply chain approach aligns with principles such as compliance, equality, no forced labour, no child labour, and environmental impact. These guiding principles and our supply chain procedures, can be found in our Quality Manual, Purchasing Control Policy, New Vendor Selection and Registration, and Vendor Performance Review.

Our Purchasing Control Policy ensures purchased goods meet quality standards and supply reliability. This includes supplier selection based on track record, financial strength, and quality and supply commitment. We strictly conform to all our adopted standards, such as ISO9001 and AECSB-Quality Manual, and conduct annual assessment on our suppliers and vendors.

To avoid any unforeseen disruptions to our supply chain,

our approach to mitigating this risk is to collaborate with multiple sources and service providers. This strategic initiative enhances our supply chain's resilience and minimises vulnerabilities associated with critical materials.

# LOCAL Procurement

Our commitment to responsible business practices is evident in our approach of giving preference to local suppliers, provided they meet our price, quality, performance, reliability and ethical standards. This is not only efficient but also reduces our ecological footprint and at the same time nurturing growth within our local communities. Our dedication to these principles is reflected in the portion of local content in our project developments.

# NURTURING A BUSINESS-FRIENDLY DIGITAL ECOSYSTEM

The digital world continues to evolve as technology advances to help businesses operate innovatively and create new revenue streams or marketing channels. Two new initiatives, namely DE Rantau and e-Invoicing by Digital Trade are introduced under the Malaysia Digital Catalytic Programmes ("PEMANGKIN") by Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation ("MDEC") as part of its continuous efforts to meet the increasing technology knowledge demand, and the standardised digital accounting documents enable businesses to be interoperable, be it within the local market or cross-border business.

With a focus on establishing Malaysia as the preferred digital nomad hub in ASEAN, DE Rantau is initiated to attract more local and foreign technology professionals to help boost digital adoption in the nation. As part of cross-border commercial standardisation, the digital trade arm intends to implement e-invoicing countrywide, which is aligned with the National E-Commerce Strategic Roadmap (NESR).

In support of MDEC's intention to drive and accelerate the sustainable growth of the nation's digital economy through the Malaysia Digital ("MD") initiative, UOA established The Tech Collective, a community enhancement initiative to bring the community closer and enables networking opportunities with one another; and an ecosystem providing competitive offerings to the community.

In FY2023, several certifications under PEMANGKIN were accorded to UOA to enhance our efforts to facilitate a business-friendly digital ecosystem, and promote Malaysia as a digital hub.

- Malaysia Digital Hub at Komune Co-Working @ The Vertical enabling our support to the tech start-up community to grow and expand their businesses through carefully selected partners.  
- DE Rantau Hub at Komune Living @ Bangsar South City, and Komune Living & Wellness @ Bandar Tun Razak through our co-living offerings at both of our properties, we are able to extend support to the digital nomads, a programme established by the government to boost digital adoption.  
- DE Rantau Ecosystem at Komune Co-Working extending support to local and foreign digital nomads with comfortable space to work at an affordable price.

The Tech Collective community comprises:

- All occupants at MD Cybercentre @ Bangsar South City, MD Cybercentre @ UOA Damansara and MD Cybercentre @ UOA Business Park;  
- All tenants at Malaysia Digital Hub at Komune Co-Working @ The Vertical;  
- All DE Rantau pass holders living at Komune Living @ Bangsar South City and Komune Living & Wellness @ Bandar Tun Razak; and  
All DE Rantau pass holders occupying Komune Co-Working

# ANTI-CORRUPTION

As a Malaysian property developer, we are acutely aware of the country's bribery and corruption risks, especially with a high Corruption Perception Index. Recent legal changes and law enforcement scrutiny have heightened anti-corruption efforts. Our vigilance extends to outbound bribery in property development, including land acquisition, a potential area for illicit incentives. Despite these challenges, we manage these risks through policies like our Code of Conduct, Anti-Bribery and Corruption ("ABC"), and Whistleblowing Policies.

We conduct an annual corruption risk assessment, meticulously evaluating the adequacy of our internal control mechanisms, such as our ABC Policy, and our compliance with the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Act Section 17A ("MACCS17A"), in order to mitigate exposure to corruption risks. The table below summarises the percentage of operations assessed for corruption-related risks.

To ensure that all employees, particularly top management, and decision-makers, have a deep understanding of our

ABC policy and procedures, we mandate their participation in formal training sessions. The table below outlines the level of engagement by employee category in our formal anti-corruption training efforts. Our goal is to conduct formal training for all key employees at least once every three years or whenever changes necessitate such training based on our risk assessments.

# ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND EMISSIONS

# ENERGY

We are acutely aware of the potential impacts of climate change on the reliability of electricity supply for our operations. These concerns extend beyond adverse weather conditions affecting power plants and transmission grids and encompass challenges in the coal and natural gas mining regions vital for Malaysia's power generation. Hence, we are dedicated to monitor our energy consumption and to reduce our carbon footprint through innovative and sustainable design, construction, and property management practices.

Our energy consumption is mainly from purchased electricity  $(88.4\%)$ , which is utilised in our construction sites, corporate offices, office building and retail spaces as well as hotel and convention centres. In FY2023, we recorded a total energy consumption of 113,859 Gigajoule ("GJ").

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/09143171-b0cc-400f-8440-f9b9008e38d5/1bb29d1ed44f8a2cf0f856f1bbcfe288d500b1b0dec101d7f0c66800a5c08c6d.jpg)  
Total Energy Consumption (Gj) By Type

Energy conversion factors used for vehicles is based on fuel or diesel litre consumption derived from UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2023, 2022, and 2021.

Energy consumption for the Group has been on the increasing trend since FY2021 by  $57.8\%$ . This is partly due to the recovery of operations returning to normal after the lifting of the Movement Control Order during the COVID-19 pandemic in FY2021 and the expansion of operations, namely Komune Living Wellness Centre and Bamboo Hills Retail.

# RENEWAL ENERGY

In addition to energy-saving and energy-efficient initiatives, we continued our efforts in the production of sustainable energy with the installation of solar panels. We are actively exploring other renewable energy solutions, other than solar panels, across our properties.

Currently, we have a rooftop solar system with a capacity of 382 kWp for self-consumption in Bamboo Hills Retail. This system reduces our reliance on grid power, lowers electricity bills, and decreases the carbon footprint of the Bamboo Hills development. This solar panels generated 467.86 MWh of solar power in FY2023, equivalent to a carbon emissions reduction of 273.70 tCO2.

Looking ahead, we are exploring potential solar panel partnerships with GSPARX Sdn Bhd and Tenaga Nasional Berhad ("TNB") on their lease-back initiatives in FY2024 for our operations in Bangsar South. These initiatives mark significant steps toward integrating renewable energy sources into our operations.

# EMISSIONS

Emissions monitoring and control are crucial for UOA, given the potential for substantial GHG emissions stemming from our energy-intensive industry. Our carbon emissions primarily result from energy consumption, which includes the direct combustion of fossil fuels (Scope 1) and purchased electricity (Scope 2), a common scenario in industries such as construction and property development. While we recognise the importance of addressing and reducing these emissions, we also acknowledge that we have not yet established a formal emissions management framework, indicating an area where we aim to make improvements. Despite the absence of specific roadmaps, our commitment to monitoring and addressing Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions remains unwavering, underscoring our dedication to responsible emissions management.

# Scope 1 GHG Emissions

UOA Scope 1 emissions are direct GHG emissions from company-owned vehicles and machineries.

waste. We acknowledge that more can be done to recycle waste and we continue to expand these efforts.

We have implemented various initiatives in our business segments to address these concerns. These include the following:

# HOSPITALITY (HOTEL AND CONVENTION CENTRES) INITIATIVES

- Komune Living Hotel in Bangsar South and Komune Living and Wellness Hotel in Cheras replaced PET bottled water with glass jugs, reducing plastic waste. Filter water dispenser are also located on every floor for guests.  
- Eliminate single use plastic.  
- Any unused assets or materials will be transferred to other business units in need to prevent the waste of resources (such as linen, towel, furniture and fittings, AV equipment, etc.).  
- We disposed our used cooking oil from kitchen operations to operators that are able to repurpose them sustainability, hence, minimising waste.

# PROPERTY INVESTMENT INITIATIVES

Recycle festive decoration materials to reduce wastage.  
- Identify and segregate waste initiated at Bamboo Hills.  
- Cashless and ticketless visitor parking system.  
- Implementation of e-billing system (Initiating with Tenants of Retail).

The waste generated from our operations, including domestic and scheduled waste, is collected by contractors at a cost. UOA strives to protect the environment, and comply with the Environmental Quality (Scheduled Wastes) Regulation, 2005. We employ contractors that are licensed by Department of Environment ("DOE") to collect and dispose of our scheduled waste at approved facilities.

UOA implemented the 3Rs Principle of "Reduce, Reuse and Recycle" at Bamboo Hills Retail in February 2023. Recyclable waste (i.e. paper/ cardboard, plastic, glass, metal etc) are identified and segregated from general waste.

# GREEN SPACE AND BIODIVERSITY

We value green spaces and biodiversity in our projects to support the conservation of the environment and enhance the well-being of our occupants. We recognise the significance of incorporating green spaces and fostering biodiversity in our developments to create a harmonious coexistence with nature.

In adhering to stringent environmental and social assessment, as well as landscape planning requirements, our dedication goes beyond mere compliance. It benefits us in multiple ways. Because of our projects are predominantly centralise in Federal Territory, landscape planning helps to reduce the urban heat island effect and provide natural buffers against extreme weather events.

Our 60-acre flagship Bangsar South City development is further complemented by a 6-acre Central Park with  $40\%$  green space and landscape areas. This 6-acre Central Park comprises landscaped boulevards, water features, and pedestrian streets. It is a green oasis and a welcoming recreational space for the community residential, commercial and retail. Recognition by the Institute of Landscape Architects Malaysia, in the category of Professional Landscape Design and Planning (Malaysia Landscape Architecture Awards 2012) is a testament to our environmental sensitivity and sustainability. Bangsar South's lifestyle hub, The Sphere was accorded a Landscape Design Honour Award in the Professional Category of the 11th Malaysia Landscape Architecture Awards (MLAA) as well. The Sphere intertwines green landscaping and flowing water features for a fresh, vibrant environment. Modern steel and glass architecture creates a spacious layout that integrates both the indoor and outdoor sections of the hub. The MLAA has recognised The Sphere as exemplary in landscape design and has deemed it an inspiration to future design trends alongside several other selected projects.

Our Komune Living & Wellness hospitality property, located in Bandar Tun Razak, offers a holistic living environment concept to our occupants. This concept is exemplified by the property's location, which is situated within an

expansive 2.06-acre site next to Taman Tasik Permaisuri, Cheras' largest public park. UOA adopted a section of the park and contributed to the preservation and maintenance. Sustaining the biodiversity, this has brought much benefits to the occupants. The development of the property next to the lake, was carefully carried out without disrupting its natural state, preserving these habitats and the local ecosystem. Additionally, it involves the creation of green buffer zones or set back for the residents.

The 16-acre site of our Bamboo Hills is another example of the incorporation of green space at our property. Lush bamboo landscapes, water features, and pockets of greenery at every corner, not only offer a serene space for city dwellers but also contribute to the environment.

Green spaces can also be promoted as featured amenities, as seen in our project, The Goodwood Residence. Featured amenities such as discovery ponds, a fragrance garden, and a garden pool, all of which also enhance the overall experience for our occupants.

Based on our efforts to enhance green spaces and biodiversity in our properties, for the past three (3) years, we have planted more than 11,000 trees across our developments.

Act 1994 (OSHA) in our operations to maintain a safe working environment. Our target is to zero work-related incidents across our operations.

building heads. Similarly, in hotels and convention centres, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Committees are formed, each chaired by the respective heads of these establishments.

To ensure safety, every building has an Emergency Response Plan ("ERP") in place. The ERTs are well-prepared to respond promptly to various emergencies, including fire outbreaks, natural disasters, medical emergencies, accidents, robberies, civil disturbances, discovering deceased individuals, and suicide attempts. Each ERT member is assigned a specific and critical role, ensuring the safety and security of all individuals within the buildings and venues.

# ADVOCATING ACTIVE RETIREMENT LIVING

The importance of retirement living in Malaysia has never been more pronounced. With an aging population set to define the next decade, providing quality living conditions tailored for the elderly is paramount. Recognising this demographic shift, the Malaysia Healthcare Travel Council (MHTC) is ready to redefine the golden years by collaborating with exceptional wellness residences such as Komune Living & Wellness to establish Malaysia as a premier destination for active retirement living.

In August 2023, a pilot programme - Rejuvenate with Malaysia Healthcare - was introduced by MHTC to address the difficulties posed by the 'silver tsunami' and an ageing society in a proactive manner. According to Farizal Jaafar, Acting Chief Executive Officer of MHTC, the programme is a testament to its commitment to providing world-class healthcare services, and promoting Malaysia as a preferred choice for active retirement living and holistic wellness. By partnering with Komune Living & Wellness, MHTC is confident in its efforts to create awareness of the programme, designed to allow seniors to age actively, surrounded by various experiential facilities and personal care.

# SUSTAINABILITY STATEMENT (CONTINUED)

# TCFD REALIGNMENT

The Company's strategy for adopting the recommendations of the TCFD revolved around four key pillars, which are:

a. Governance: Disclosing climate-related governance, including Board involvement and management's role in assessment.  
b. Strategy: Revealing climate risks/opportunities in business, strategy, and finance.  
c. Risk Management: Disclosing the process of how we identify, assess, and manage climate-related risks through the climate risk impact assessment process.  
d. Metrics and Targets: Describing climate metrics, encompassing energy consumption, scope 1 and 2 emissions.

# The table below summarised UOA's responses to TCFD disclosure recommendations:

# RECOMMENDATIONS

# OUR RESPONSES

# GOVERNANCE

a. Describe the board's oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities.  
b. Describe management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities.

The Board holds responsibility for providing guidance on climate-related risks, ensuring the incorporation of sustainability best practices in critical decision-making processes, and approving the sustainability and risk management framework, while also deliberates on matters pertaining to sustainability and risk governance. Additionally, the Sustainability Committee reviews and recommends climate-risks strategies and performance targets for UOA on a group-wide basis as disclosed in the Sustainability Governance section of our Sustainability Statement.

# STRATEGY

a. Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the organisation has identified over the short, medium, and long term.  
b. Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organisation's business, strategy, and financial planning.  
c. Describe the resilience of the organisation's strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a  $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  or lower scenario.

UOA has yet to perform the climate scenario analysis on the physical and transitional risks. Therefore, we have not identified the Company's resilience strategy in different climate-related scenarios.

However, we continue to identify the risks and opportunities posed by climate change as follows:

Risks posed by climate change:

# a. Climate-Induced Project Disruptions

Risk

Increased occurrences of extreme weather events can lead to project delays, structural damage, and escalated UOA construction costs.

Impact

- Delays in project timelines.  
- Increased construction and repair costs.  
- Potential harm to both the structural integrity of the infrastructure and the safety of people during such events.

# OUR RESPONSES

# STRATEGY

However, we continue to identify the risks and opportunities posed by climate change as follows: (Continued)

Opportunities posed by climate change:

a. Actively seeking green building certifications, including GBI and LEED, for both our existing and upcoming properties serves to elevate the sustainability credentials of our developments. This initiative not only underscores our commitment to environmentally responsible practices but also positions our properties as appealing choices for investors and tenants who prioritise ecological consciousness. Detailed updates on the advancement of green building certifications for our properties are available in the dedicated "Sustainable Design/Green Building" section of this Sustainability Statement.  
b. Encourage the use of eco-friendly materials, energy-efficient systems, and environmentally friendly designs in our properties in response to heightened climate change concerns. More details of the sustainable design building initiatives are explained in "Sustainable Design/Green Building" section of this Sustainability Statement. We also actively seek partnerships with solar panel providers, as outlined in the "Energy and Emissions Management" section of our Sustainability Statement. This strategic initiative not only allows us to contribute significantly to a greener future but also opens avenues for potential cost savings.  
c. Building a reputation as a dependable property developer known for reliability in the face of climate change induced erratic and extreme weather patterns.

# RISK MANAGEMENT

a. Describe the organisation's processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks.  
b. Describe the organisation's processes for managing climate-related risks.  
c. Describe how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the organisation's overall risk management.

We conduct a climate risk impact assessment, evaluating climate change risks for their significance. When relevant, these risks are further assessed within the Enterprise Risk Management ("ERM") framework. The results, including identified material risks, are presented to the board for guidance and advice.

# BOARD'S RESPONSIBILITIES

# STATEMENT OF RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL (CONTINUED)

# RISK MANAGEMENT

The Board has established a sound risk management framework which is currently being adopted by the Management that enables it to continuously identify, evaluate, mitigate, and monitor risks that affect the Group. The risk management framework is guided by COSO - Enterprise Risk Management Integrating with Strategy and Performance. Responsibility for managing risks lies initially with the business unit concerned, working within the overall strategy outlined by the Board. Therefore, the Management has formed the Risk Management Working Committee ("RMWC") which encompasses key personnel from various departments to identify potential risks, to assess the effectiveness of existing controls, and to develop mitigation measures to manage significant risks.

With the assistance rendered by the internal auditors, the RMWC has formulated and developed a Risk Management Policy which was reviewed by the ARMC and approved by the Board. The Risk Management Policy is aimed to:

- Provide objectives and principles in risk management activities;  
- Establish responsibilities and accountability in risk management;  
- Establish risk management structure and process; and  
- Establish risk parameter in risk assessment.

Identified risks are categorised and assessed in terms of likelihood and consequence. Subsequently to the risk assessment, a residual risk rating is recorded after considering effectiveness of internal controls in mitigating the risk. The outcome of the risk assessment is recorded in a Risk Register and Risk Heat Map for the ARMC deliberation. The RMWC ensures that internal controls are in place and effective in mitigating the risk while the ARMC provides an oversight role in risk management.

The management has given assurance to the Board that the Group's risk management and internal control system is operating adequately and effectively, in all material aspects, based on the Group's risk management and internal control system.

For year 2023, the Group identified major risks and mitigating actions were undertaken within appropriate timeframes. The major risks identified are as follow:

# Instability in property market

Slowdown of the economy and political instability could cause instability in the property market, hence leading to slower sales and lower revenue. To mitigate this risk, management regularly reviewed its products to ensure product competitiveness for retaining customer loyalty and attracting new customers. In addition, attractive and flexible sales packages were offered to entice purchasers. Aggressive sales and marketing initiatives including social media marketing are in place to reach out to more potential customers.

# Increase in construction cost

Increase costs in building materials, transportation and labour have caused an increase in construction cost. Management constantly monitored the construction cost and one of the measures was ensuring that our purchases were made in accordance to budget. The increase in building material price and labour cost were also considered during budget preparation. Regular budget meeting were held to monitor actual construction cost and ensure that it remained within the budget. It is also the Company's practice to purchase building materials in bulk for better pricing and greater saving.

# Inability to lease out properties

Inability to lease out properties could result in the decrease of occupancy rate and income. To mitigate this risk, management constantly reviewed the rental rates and monitored the market rental rates to ensure competitiveness of our products. In addition, our marketing initiatives through agents and on-line platform enabled us to reach out to more potential tenants. Regular maintenance works and building upgrading works when conducted when necessary to ensure that our properties remain in good condition to retain and attract tenants.

# STATEMENT OF RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL (CONTINUED)

# RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES

The Group has set 4 strategies in response to any identified risk. The 4 strategies are as follows:

# Risk Mitigation / Reduction

Taking steps to reduce the risk of loss by implementing more internal controls, introducing policies and procedures, providing training to staff and continuous monitoring.

# Risk Transfer

Taking steps to transfer the risk by using business strategies, opportunities, negotiation, outsourcing, sharing business risk via joint venture or partnership, and transferring financial risk via insurance coverage.

# Risk Avoidance

Taking steps to avoid the risk by either stopping business dealings/processes that potentially may give rise to threats to the Group, avoiding unnecessary business ventures which the Group is unfamiliar with and altering processes to avoid those risks.

# Risk Acceptance

In cases where risks are insignificant or inherent due to business nature, the RMWC and the Board would accept the risk as long as it meets the objective of the Group and processes are efficiently and effectively carried out at the minimal cost to the Group.

# OTHER RISKS AND CONTROL PROCESS

The Board has also put in place organisational structures with formally defined reporting lines, segregation of responsibility and delegation of authority. A process of hierarchical reporting has been established which provides for a documented and auditable trail of accountability.

Review of monthly financial information which includes actual results compared against budget, an explanation on

significant variances and management actions taken, where necessary. In addition, the ARMC and the Board review the quarterly results and year-end financial statements. Where areas of improvement in the internal control system are identified, the Board considered the recommendations made by the ARMC.

# REVIEW OF THE STATEMENT BY EXTERNAL AUDITORS

As required by paragraph 15.23 of Main Market Listing Requirements of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad, the external auditors have reviewed this Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control. Their review was performed in accordance with Audit and Assurance Practice Guides 3 ("AAPG 3") issued by Malaysian Institute of Accountants. Based on their review, the external auditors have reported to the Board that nothing has come to

their attention that causes them to believe that this statement is inconsistent with their understanding of the process adopted by the Board in reviewing the adequacy and integrity of the system of internal control of the Group. AAPG 3 does not require the external auditors to consider whether this Statement covers all risks and controls, or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's risk and control procedures.

# THE BOARD'S COMMITMENT

The Board is committed to maintaining a sound system of internal control and is of the view that the current system of internal control is responsive to the business environment of the Group. In addition, the Board is of the

view that the Group could attain its business objective and operational efficiency by continuous commitment to a sound system of internal control. The Board continues to take measures to enhance the system of internal control.

# OTHER STATUTORY INFORMATION

Before the financial statements were made out, the Directors took reasonable steps:

a. to ascertain the action taken in relation to the writing off of bad debts and the making of allowance for doubtful debts and satisfied themselves that all known bad debts had been written off and that adequate allowance had been made for doubtful debts; and  
b. to ensure that any current assets which were unlikely to be realised in the ordinary course of business including their values as shown in the accounting records of the Group and of the Company had been written down to an amount which they might be expected so to realise.

At the date of this report, the Directors are not aware of any circumstances:

a. which would render the amount written off for bad debts or the amount of the allowance for doubtful debts in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company inadequate to any substantial extent; or  
b. which would render the values attributed to the current assets in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company misleading; or  
c. which have arisen which render adherence to the existing method of valuation of assets or liabilities of the Group and of the Company misleading or inappropriate; or  
d. not otherwise dealt with in this report or the financial statements of the Group and of the Company which would render any amount stated in the respective financial statements misleading.

At the date of this report, there does not exist:

a. any charge on the assets of the Group and of the Company which has arisen since the end of the financial year which secures the liabilities of any other person; or  
b. any contingent liability of the Group and of the Company which has arisen since the end of the financial year.

In the opinion of the Directors:

a. no contingent or other liability of the Group and of the Company has become enforceable or is likely to become enforceable within the period of twelve months after the end of the financial year which, in the opinion of the Directors, will or may affect the ability of the Group and of the Company to meet their obligations as and when they fall due;  
b. the results of the operations of the Group and of the Company for the financial year were not substantially affected by any item, transaction or event of a material and unusual nature; and

# INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF UOA DEVELOPMENT BHD

(Incorporated in Malaysia) Registration No.: 200401015520 (654023-V)

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# OPINION

We have audited the financial statements of UOA Development Bhd, which comprise the statements of financial position as at 31 December 2023 of the Group and of the Company, and the statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows of the Group and of the Company for the financial year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of material accounting policies, as set out on pages 93 to 152.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and of the Company as at 31 December 2023, and of their financial performance and their cash flows for the financial year then ended in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS Accounting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.

# BASIS FOR OPINION

We conducted our audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

# INDEPENDENCE AND OTHER ETHICAL RESPONSIBILITIES

We are independent of the Group and of the Company in accordance with the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, Conduct and Practice) of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants ("By-Laws") and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) ("IESBA Code"), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the By-Laws and the IESBA Code.

# KEY AUDIT MATTERS

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Fair value of investment properties

The risk - The Group has investment properties that are stated at fair values based on valuation reports prepared by independent professional valuers. These valuations rely on the accuracy of assumptions, estimates and financial information provided to the valuers.

Consequently, the determination of the fair values of investment properties involves significant management judgement and estimations by the Directors. As such, we have identified this area as a significant risk requiring special audit consideration.

Our response - Our audit procedures included, amongst others, evaluating the competencies, capabilities and objectivities of the independent valuers, performing site visits of all material investment properties, checking the accuracy and relevance of input data used in the valuations, evaluating the valuation amounts by comparing against comparable property sales and market data used in the valuations.

The Group's disclosures regarding investment properties are included in Notes 3.3 and 5 to the Financial Statements.

Revenue and cost of sales recognition for property development activities

The risk - The Group recognises revenue and cost of sales for property development activities based on the measurement of the Group's progress towards complete satisfaction of the Group's performance obligations.

In determining the progress, management is required to exercise significant judgement in estimating total costs to complete and total estimated revenue. As such, we have identified this area as a significant risk requiring special audit consideration.

Our response - Our audit procedures included, amongst others, inquiries with the operational and financial personnel of the Group for the assumptions used, comparing estimated costs to actual costs to assess the reliability of management's budgeting process and control, inspecting contracts with sub-contractors, performing analyses of cost budgets, understanding and evaluating the operating effectiveness of key controls surrounding revenue and cost of sales, performing site visits of all ongoing projects, performing analyses of total estimated revenue and testing the computation of revenue and cost of sales recognised.

The Group's disclosures regarding property development activities are included in Notes 3.7, 6, 10, 29 and 30 to the Financial Statements.

There are no key audit matters in relation to the financial statements of the Company.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF UOA DEVELOPMENT BHD (Incorporated in Malaysia) Registration No.: 200401015520 (654023-V) (CONTINUED)

# INFORMATION OTHER THAN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND AUDITORS' REPORT THEREON

The Directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but does not include the financial statements of the Group and of the Company and our auditors' report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DIRECTORS FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that give a true and fair view in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS Accounting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

# AUDITORS' RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors'

report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.  
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's and the Company's internal control.  
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors.  
- Conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's or the Company's abilities to continue as going concerns. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Company to cease to continue as going concerns.  
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF UOA DEVELOPMENT BHD (Incorporated in Malaysia) Registration No.: 200401015520 (654023-V) (CONTINUED)

# AUDITORS' RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also (continued):

- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements of the Group. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably

be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

From the matters communicated with the Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# OTHER MATTER

This report is made solely to the members of the Company, as a body, in accordance with Section 266 of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility to any other person for the content of this report.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

# 1. GENERAL INFORMATION

UOA Development Bhd (the "Company") is a public limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in Malaysia, and listed on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad. The addresses of the principal place of business and registered office of the Company are disclosed in page 83.

The Directors regard United Overseas Australia Ltd, a company incorporated in Australia and listed on the Australian Stock Exchange and the Stock Exchange of Singapore as the ultimate holding company.

The immediate holding company is UOA Holdings Sdn Bhd, a company incorporated and domiciled in Malaysia.

The Company is principally engaged in provision of management services and investment holding. There has been no significant change in the Company's principal activities during the financial year. The principal activities of the subsidiary companies are disclosed in Note 7 to the Financial Statements.

The financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors in accordance with a resolution of the Directors passed on 26 March 2024.

# 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION

# 2.1 Statement of compliance

The financial statements of the Group and of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards ("MFRS"), IFRS Accounting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.

# 2.2 Basis of measurement

The financial statements of the Group and of the Company are prepared under the historical cost convention except for certain land, buildings and investments that are measured at fair values at the reporting date as disclosed in the summary of material accounting policies.

Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of consideration given in exchange for goods and services.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability, or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Group or the Company.

The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.

A fair value measurement of a non-financial market takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.

The Group and the Company use valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023 (CONTINUED)

# 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED)

# 2.2 Basis of measurement (Continued)

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to their fair value measurement as a whole:

a) Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  
b) Level 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to their fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable  
c) Level 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to their fair value measurement is unobservable

For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group and the Company determine whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to their fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting year.

For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group and the Company have determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of fair value hierarchy as explained above.

# 2.3 Functional and presentation currency

The financial statements are presented in Ringgit Malaysia ("RM"), which is also the Group's and the Company's functional currency. All amounts in the financial statements are rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise indicated.

# 2.4 Adoption of new standards/amendments/improvements to MFRS

At the beginning of the current financial year, the Group and Company adopted new standards / amendments / improvements to MFRS which are mandatory for the financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. The details of the amendments that have impact on the Group's and the Company's financial statements are disclosed below.

Amendments to MFRS 101 Presentation of Financial Statements - Disclosure of Accounting Policies

The amendments change the requirements in MFRS 101 with regard to disclosure of accounting policies. The amendments replace all instances of the term 'significant' with 'material'. Accounting policy information is material if, when considered together with other information included in an entity's financial statements, it can reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general-purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements.

The supporting paragraphs in MFRS 101 are also amended to clarify that accounting policy information that relates to immaterial transactions, other events or conditions is immaterial and need not be disclosed. Accounting policy information may be material because of the nature of the related transactions, other events or conditions, even if the amounts are immaterial. However, not all accounting policy information relating to material transactions, other events or conditions is itself material.

The amendments have had an impact on the Group's and Company's disclosures of accounting policies but not on the measurement, recognition or presentation of any items in the Group's and Company's financial statements.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023 (CONTINUED)

# 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED)

# 2.4 Adoption of new standards/amendments/improvements to MFRS (Continued)

Amendments to MFRS 108 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors - Definition of Accounting Estimates

The amendments to MFRS 108 clarify the distinction between changes in accounting estimates, changes in accounting policies and the correction of errors. They also clarify how entities use measurement techniques and inputs to develop accounting estimates.

This distinction between these two types of changes is important as changes in accounting policies are normally applied retrospectively to past transactions and events, whereas changes in accounting estimates are applied prospectively to future transactions and events. The amendments have had no impact on the Group's and the Company's financial statements.

# 2.5 Standards issued but not yet effective

The amended standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective are disclosed below. The Group and the Company intend to adopt these amended standards and interpretations, if applicable, when they become effective:

# 2.6 Significant accounting estimates and judgements

Estimates, assumptions concerning the future and judgements are made in the preparation of the financial statements. They affect the application of the Group's and the Company's accounting policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, expenses and disclosures made. Estimates and underlying assumptions are assessed on an on-going basis and are based on experience and relevant factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The actual result may differ from the judgements, estimates and assumptions made by management and will seldom equal the estimated results.

# 2.6 Significant accounting estimates and judgements (Continued)

# 2.6.1 Estimation uncertainty

Information about significant judgements, estimates and assumptions that have the most significant effect on recognition and measurement of assets, liabilities, income and expenses are discussed below:

# Useful lives of depreciable assets

Property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. Management estimates the useful lives of the depreciable assets to be within 5 and 99 years and reviews the useful lives of depreciable assets at each reporting date. At the reporting date, management assesses that the useful lives represent the expected utility of the assets to the Group and the Company. Actual results, however, may vary due to change in the expected level of usage, physical wear and tear and technological developments, which may result in adjustments to the Group's and the Company's assets.

# Deferred tax assets

Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences, unabsorbed tax losses, unutilised capital allowances and unutilised investment tax allowances to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, unabsorbed tax losses, unutilised capital allowances and unutilised investment tax allowances can be utilised.

Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based on the likely timing and level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies.

# Inventories

Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. In estimating net realisable values, management takes into account the most reliable evidence available at the time the estimates are made. The Group's core business is subject to economical changes which may cause selling prices to change rapidly and the Group's net result to change.

# Fair value of investment properties

The Group measures its investment properties at fair value with any change in fair value recognised in the profit or loss. Significant judgement is required in the determination of fair value which may be derived based on different valuation methods. In making the judgement, the Group evaluates based on past experience and reliance on the work of specialists. The Group engages independent professional valuers to determine fair value.

Information regarding the valuation techniques and inputs used in determining the fair value are disclosed in Note 5 to the Financial Statements.

# Property development activities and construction contracts

As revenue from ongoing property development activities and construction contracts are recognised over time, the amount of revenue recognised at the reporting date depends on the extent to which the performance obligation has been satisfied. This is done by determining the stage of completion. The stage of completion is determined by the proportion that property development or contract costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the estimated total property development or contract costs.

Significant judgement is required in determining the stage of completion, the extent of the development and contract costs incurred, the estimated total revenue and total costs and the recoverability of the development project and contract cost. In making these judgements, management relies on past experience and, if necessary, the work of specialists.

# 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED)

# 2.6 Significant accounting estimates and judgements (Continued)

# 2.6.1 Estimation uncertainty (Continued)

Provision for expected credit losses ("ECLs") of receivables and contract assets

The Group uses a provision matrix to calculate ECLs for receivables and contract assets. The provision rates are based on days past due for groupings of various customer segments that have similar loss patterns (i.e. by geography, product type, customer type and rating, coverage by letter of credit and other forms of credit insurance).

The provision matrix is initially based on the Group's historical observed default rates. The Group will calibrate the matrix to adjust the historical credit loss experience with forward-looking information. For instance, if forecast economic conditions (i.e. gross domestic product) are expected to deteriorate over the next year which can lead to an increased number of defaults in the real estate sector, the historical default rates are adjusted. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.

The assessment of the correlation between historical observed default rates, forecast economic conditions and ECLs is a significant estimate. The amount of ECLs is sensitive to changes in circumstances and of forecast economic conditions. The Group's historical credit loss experience and forecast of economic conditions may also not be representative of customer's actual default in the future.

Impairment of non-financial assets

An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's or cash-generating unit's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. To determine the recoverable amount, management estimates expected future cash flows from each asset or cash-generating unit and determines a suitable interest rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. In the process of measuring expected future cash flows, management makes assumptions about future operating results. The actual results may vary, and may cause significant adjustments to the Group's and the Company's assets within the next financial year.

In most cases, determining the applicable discount rate involves estimating the appropriate adjustments to market risk and the appropriate adjustment to asset-specific risk factors.

# Income taxes

Significant judgement is involved in determining the Group's or the Company's wide provision for income taxes. There are certain transactions and computations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. The Group and the Company recognise tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recognised, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the year in which such determination is made.

# 2.6.2 Significant management judgements

The following are significant judgements made by management in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the financial statements.

# 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION (CONTINUED)

# 2.6 Significant accounting estimates and judgements (Continued)

# 2.6.2 Significant management judgements (Continued)

Classification between investment properties and owner-occupied properties

The Group determines whether a property qualifies as an investment property and has developed the criteria in making that judgement. Investment property is a property held to earn rental or for capital appreciation or both.

Certain properties comprise a portion that is held to earn rental or for capital appreciation and another portion that is held for use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes. The Group accounts for the portions separately if the portions could be sold separately (or leased out separately under a finance lease). If the portions could not be sold separately, the property is an investment property only if an insignificant portion is held for use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes.

Judgement is made on an individual property basis to determine whether ancillary services are so significant that a property does not qualify as an investment property.

Deferred tax on investment properties

For the purposes of measuring deferred tax liabilities arising from investment properties that are measured using the fair value model, the management of the Group reviews the investment properties and concluded that the Group's investment properties are held under a business model whose objective is to recover the carrying amount of the investment properties through sale.

Accordingly, the Group recognises deferred taxes in respect of the changes in fair value of investment properties based on Real Property Gains Tax ("RPGT"). The final tax outcome could be different from the deferred tax liabilities recognised in the financial statements should the economic benefits embodied in the investment properties be subsequently substantially consumed over time rather than through sale.

# 3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Group and the Company apply the material accounting policies, as summarised below, consistently throughout all years presented in the financial statements, unless otherwise stated.

# 3.1 Business combinations

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method from the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group, except for Allied Engineering Construction Sdn Bhd, URC Engineering Sdn Bhd and UOA Properties Sdn Bhd, which are consolidated using the merger method of accounting.

Under the merger method of accounting, the results of entities or businesses under common control are accounted for as if the acquisition had occurred at the date that common control was established. The cost of an acquisition is measured at the nominal value of ordinary shares issued as consideration. The assets and liabilities acquired are included in the consolidated statement of financial position at their existing carrying amounts.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023 (CONTINUED)

# 3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# 3.2 Property, plant and equipment

All property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and less any impairment losses.

Depreciation is recognised on the straight-line method in order to write off the cost of each asset over its estimated useful life. Freehold land with an infinite life is not depreciated.

The principal annual depreciation rates used are as follows:

<table><tr><td>Leasehold land</td><td>Over the period of the lease</td></tr><tr><td>Leasehold buildings</td><td>2%</td></tr><tr><td>Freehold buildings</td><td>2%</td></tr><tr><td>Plant, machineries and motor vehicles</td><td>10% - 20%</td></tr><tr><td>Furniture, fittings and equipment</td><td>10% - 20%</td></tr></table>

Fully depreciated assets are retained in the financial statements until they are no longer in use and no further charge for depreciation is made in respect of these assets.

# 3.3 Investment properties

Investment properties are measured at fair value and are revalued annually and are included in the statements of financial position at their open market values.

If the fair value of an investment property under construction is not reliably measurable but the Group expects the fair value of the investment property to be reliably measurable when construction is complete, that investment property under construction is measured at cost until either its fair value becomes reliably measurable or construction is completed (whichever is earlier).

# 3.4 Leases

# 3.4.1 As a lessee

The Group and the Company apply a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Group and the Company recognise lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.

# Short-term lease

The Group and the Company apply the short-term lease recognition exemption to their short-term leases (i.e. those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). Lease payments on short-term leases are recognised as expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

# Right-of-use assets

Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:

Leasehold land 99 years  
Leasehold buildings 50 years  
Motor vehicles 5 to 10 years  
Plant and machineries 5 to 10 years

# 3.5 Inventories

Costs of consumables and medicinal products are determined on first in first out method.

# 3.6 Financial instruments

A financial instrument is any contract that give rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.

Financial assets at amortised cost

The Group's and the Company's financial assets at amortised cost include trade and other receivables, amounts owing by ultimate holding company, subsidiary companies, related companies and cash and cash equivalents.

Financial assets designated at fair value through other comprehensive income (equity instruments)

The Group and the Company elected to classify irrevocably their equity investments under financial assets designated at fair value through other comprehensive income (equity instruments).

Financial liabilities at amortised cost

The Group's and the Company's financial liabilities at amortised cost include trade and other payables, amounts owing to immediate holding company, subsidiary companies, related companies, non-controlling shareholders of subsidiary companies, lease liabilities and borrowings.

# 3.7 Revenue from contracts with customers

# Revenue recognition

The Group recognises revenue from property development and constructions over time if it creates an asset with no alternative use to the Group and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. Revenue is recognised over the period of the contract by reference to the progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation.

The progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation is measured based on the Group's efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of the performance obligation (e.g. by reference to the property development or contract costs incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total development or contract costs of the contract, i.e. the stage of completion).

Revenue from sales of completed properties is recognised upon delivery of properties where the control of the properties or land has passed to the buyers.

Other revenue earned by the Group and the Company are recognised on the following bases:

- Management fee income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.  
Distribution income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.  
- Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.  
- Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis.  
- Hotel room income is recognised when services are rendered.  
- Food and beverage and other related income are recognised when services are rendered.  
- Sale of medicinal, pharmaceuticals, healthcare and beauty care products income are recognised when the goods are delivered.

# 3.7 Revenue from contracts with customers (Continued)

Revenue recognition (Continued)

Other revenue earned by the Group and the Company are recognised on the following bases (continued):

- Healthcare, medicinal, physiotherapy and acupuncture, dental consultancy and treatment and other healthcare related services income are recognised when services are rendered.  
- Course fees from provision of education, training services and consultancy services income is recognised when services are rendered.

# 3.8 Tax expense

Deferred tax assets

A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

Deferred tax liabilities

Where investment properties are carried at their fair value, the amount of deferred tax recognised is measured using the tax rates that would apply on sale of those assets at their carrying values at the reporting date unless the property is depreciable and is held with the objective to consume substantially all of the economic benefits embodied in the property over time, rather than through sale. In all other cases, the amount of deferred tax recognised is measured based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of the asset and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

# 5. INVESTMENT PROPERTIES (CONTINUED)

The Group's investment properties comprise freehold condominium and apartment, freehold commercial properties, leasehold commercial properties and properties under construction.

Some investment properties as at 31 December 2023 are stated at fair value by reference to a full valuation conducted by a registered independent valuer having appropriate recognised professional qualifications for certain investment properties and some based on an assessment by the Board of Directors by obtaining update valuations for investment properties that did not have a full valuation conducted.

The fair value represents the amount at which the properties could be exchanged on an open market basis between a knowledgeable willing buyer and a knowledgeable willing seller in an arm's length transaction at the reporting date.

Whilst a full valuation has not been conducted for certain investment properties, the Board of Directors have obtained updated market values of the investment properties as at 31 December 2023 carried out by a firm of independent professional valuers who has appropriate professional qualification and recent experience in the relevant location and assets being valued. For investment properties where the assessment by the Board of Directors were based on updated valuations, the existing book values of the investment properties as at 31 December 2023 ("Book Values") were not materially different from the updated valuations performed.

In view of the above and taking into account current market conditions, the Board of Directors assessed that the Book Values are fair. Hence, the Book Values were not adjusted and were taken to represent the fair values of the investment properties at the same date.

The fair values of the investment properties were determined using comparison method, cost method or investment method.

The following assumptions have been applied in the valuations:

i. The comparison method entails comparing the property with comparable properties which have been sold or are being offered for sale and making adjustments for factors which affect value such as location and accessibility, size, building construction and finishes, building services, management and maintenance, age and state of repair, market conditions and other relevant characteristics.  
ii. Under the cost method, the value of the land is added to the replacement cost of the buildings and other site improvements. The replacement cost of the buildings is derived from estimation of reproduction cost of similar new buildings based on current market prices for materials, labour and present construction techniques and deducting therefrom the accrued depreciation due to use and disrepair, age and obsolescence through technology and market changes.  
iii. The investment method entails the determination of the probable gross annual rental the property is capable of producing and deducting therefrom the outgoings to arrive at the annual net income.

The fair values of investment properties classified under level 2 were determined using comparison method and level 3 were determined using cost or investment method.

There has been no change in valuation methods used during the financial year.

The fair value hierarchy of the Group's investment properties as at the reporting date is as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">GROUP</td><td colspan="3">2023</td><td colspan="3">2022</td></tr><tr><td>Level 2 RM&#x27;000</td><td>Level 3 RM&#x27;000</td><td>Total RM&#x27;000</td><td>Level 2 RM&#x27;000</td><td>Level 3 RM&#x27;000</td><td>Total RM&#x27;000</td></tr><tr><td>Freehold and leasehold properties</td><td>1,050,180</td><td>566,400</td><td>1,616,580</td><td>1,075,862</td><td>487,000</td><td>1,562,862</td></tr></table>

The following table shows a reconciliation of Level 3 fair values of investment properties:

Details of Level 3 fair value measurements are as follows:

<table><tr><td>Valuation method and key inputs</td><td>Significant unobservable inputs</td><td>Relationship of unobservable inputs and fair value</td></tr><tr><td>Cost method which estimates the amount of reconstruction cost of the building based on current market prices net of depreciation.</td><td>Estimated replacement costs.</td><td>The higher the estimated replacement costs, the higher the fair value.</td></tr><tr><td>Investment method which involves capitalisation of the net annual income with allowance for voids by using a suitable rate of return consistent with the type and quality of investment to arrive at the market value.</td><td>Term yield rate of 6.50% (2022: 6.50% to 7.00%) 
Reversionary yield rate of 6.75% to 7.00% (2022: 6.50% to 7.00%) 
Occupancy rates of 85.59% to 97.06% (2022: 85.19% to 94.83%)</td><td>The estimated fair value would be increase (decrease) if: 
Term yield rate is lower (higher) 
Reversionary yield rate is lower (higher) 
Occupancy rate is higher (lower)</td></tr></table>

The properties under construction are measured at cost because the fair value is not yet determinable as of 31 December 2023. The fair value of the properties is expected to be reliably determinable when the construction is complete.

The decrease of trade receivables was due to receipts collected during the financial year.

Contract assets increase as a result of the significant progress in development properties over the billings issued to customers.

There were no contract liabilities at the reporting date and in the previous year presented and no revenue was recognised from performance obligations satisfied in previous years.

# 29.3 Performance obligations

# Sale of properties and construction contracts

For sale of development properties under construction and construction contracts, the performance obligation is satisfied over time as the Group's performance does not create an asset with an alternative use and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.

For the sale of completed properties, the performance obligation is satisfied upon delivery of the properties or when control of the land has been passed to the buyer.

The payment terms for progress billings made to purchasers are disclosed in Notes 11 and 15 to the Financial Statements.

The nature of the properties that the Group has promised to transfer to purchasers are residential houses and commercial units/buildings.

The Group's properties are subject to a defects liability period of generally twenty-four (24) months from the delivery of vacant possession. This requires the Group to rectify any defects which may appear and which are due to design, materials, goods, workmanship or equipment that are not in accordance with the sale and purchase agreement.

# 39. MATERIAL LITIGATIONS

On 31 December 2018, two of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary companies, namely Windsor Triumph Sdn Bhd ("Windsor") and Sunny Uptown Sdn Bhd ("Sunny") were served by the Inland Revenue Board of Malaysia ("IRB") with Notices of Additional Assessment for the Year of Assessment 2013, for additional income tax totalling RM25,558,750.50 and penalties totalling RM14,057,312.78 ("Cases").

The additional assessment raised against Windsor by IRB arose from an adjustment by IRB of the market value of property that Windsor had withdrawn as an inventory to hold as investment property, whereas the additional assessment raised against Sunny by IRB arose from an adjustment by IRB of the selling price at market value of properties that Sunny had assigned to another wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group on an "as is" basis.

Both subsidiary companies relied on valuations by a professional, independent and experienced registered valuer. These valuations were adjusted by IRB by substituting them with valuations subsequently conducted by Jabatan Penilaian dan Perkhidmatan Harta.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023 (CONTINUED)

# 39. MATERIAL LITIGATIONS (CONTINUED)

On 1 August 2023, Windsor had entered into a Settlement Agreement with IRB to agree on the additional income tax of RM4,325,000. Windsor had on 31 August 2023 agreed to discontinue the appeal and each party shall undertake to do the necessary to give full effect to the Agreement, whereas all excess income tax paid by Windsor shall be refunded within a reasonable period of time.

On 5 February 2024, Sunny had entered into a Settlement Agreement with IRB to agree on the additional income tax of RM1,122,500 and penalty of RM617,375 totalling RM1,739,875.

The amounts of the additional income tax and penalty for both of the companies have been recognised in profit or loss during the financial year.

In view of the above, the Directors are of the opinion that the additional income taxes and penalty charge had been appropriately taken up in the financial statements and no additional provisions in respect of the tax liabilities and penalty in dispute are required to be made in the financial statements as at the reporting date.

# 40. MATURITY ANALYSIS OF LEASE PAYMENTS

Transactions between segments were entered into in the normal course of business and were established on terms and conditions that are not materially different from that obtainable in transactions with unrelated parties. The effects of such inter-segmental transactions are eliminated on consolidation.

The operations of the Group are wholly carried out in Malaysia. Group income taxes are presented on a group basis and are not allocated to operating segments.

There is no significant concentration of revenue from any major customers as the Group sells its development properties to various purchasers.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023 (CONTINUED)

# 43. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES

The Group and the Company are exposed to financial risks arising from their operations and the use of financial instruments. Financial risk management policies are established to ensure that adequate resources are available for the development of the Group's and the Company's businesses whilst managing its risks. The Group and the Company operate within clearly defined policies and procedures that are approved by the Board of Directors to ensure the effectiveness of the risk management process.

The main areas of financial risks faced by the Group and the Company and the policies in respect of the major areas of treasury activity are set out as follows:

# a) Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of a financial loss to the Group and the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. It is the Group's and the Company's policy to enter into financial instruments with a diversity of creditworthy counterparties. The Group and the Company do not expect to incur material credit losses of its financial assets or other financial instruments.

Concentration of credit risk exists when changes in economic, industry and geographical factors similarly affect the group of counterparties whose aggregate credit exposure is significant in relation to the Group's and the Company's total credit exposure. The Group's and the Company's portfolio of financial instruments is broadly diversified and transactions are entered into with diverse creditworthy counterparties, thereby mitigate any significant concentration of credit risk.

The Group's and the Company's objective are to seek continual revenue growth while minimising losses incurred due to increase credit risk exposure. The Group and the Company extend credit only to recognised and creditworthy third parties. It is the Group's and the Company's policy that all customers are subject to credit verification procedures. In addition, receivables balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group's and the Company's exposure to bad debts is not significant.

# i. Receivables and contract assets

In respect of trade receivables arising from the sale of the Group's development properties, the Group mitigates any credit risk it may have by maintaining its name as the registered owner of the development properties until full settlement by the purchasers of the self-financed portion of the purchase consideration and upon undertaking of end-financing by the purchaser's end-financier.

In respect of the Group's investment properties and tenanted unsold inventories, the Group customarily obtains three months' rental deposit from tenants as security for the performance of their obligations under the tenancy agreements to mitigate the risk of non-collectability of monthly rentals.

An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date using a provision matrix to measure expected credit losses. The provision rates are based on days past due for groupings of various customer segments with similar loss patterns (i.e. customer type and rating and coverage by collateral). The calculation reflects the probability-weighted outcome, the time value of money and reasonable and supportable information that is available at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.

Generally, trade receivables are written off if the Directors deem them uncollectable. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of financial assets.

# 43. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES (CONTINUED)

The main areas of financial risks faced by the Group and the Company and the policies in respect of the major areas of treasury activity are set out as follows (Continued):

# a) Credit risk (Continued)

# i. Receivables and contract assets (Continued)

Collateral is considered an integral part of trade receivables and considered in the calculation of impairment. At the reporting date, all of the Group's trade receivables are covered by collateral other than the trade receivables that are credit impaired. As such, no expected credit losses are required as at reporting date for trade receivables that are covered by collateral. The Group evaluates the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables and contract assets as low, as trade receivables consists of a large number of customers in various backgrounds.

Receivables that are individually determined to be credit impaired at the financial year end relate to debtors who are in significant financial difficulties and had defaulted on payments.

# Other receivables

The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by their carrying amounts in the statements of financial position.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023 (CONTINUED)

# 43. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES (CONTINUED)

The main areas of financial risks faced by the Group and the Company and the policies in respect of the major areas of treasury activity are set out as follows (Continued):

# a) Credit risk (Continued)

# ii. Intercompanies balances

The maximum exposure to credit risk for intercompanies balances is represented by their carrying amounts in the statements of financial position.

The Group and the Company has management fee receivable, rental receivable, progress billing receivables and also provide unsecured advances to ultimate holding, subsidiary and related companies and monitors the results of these companies regularly. As at the reporting date, there was no indication that the management fee receivable, rental receivable, progress billing receivables and the advances to these companies are not recoverable.

# iii. Financial institutions and cash deposits

Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Group's treasury department in accordance with the Group's policy. Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties.

# iv. Financial guarantees

The maximum exposure to credit risk by the Company amounted to RM51,566,000 (2022: RM53,251,000), represented by the bank guarantees and outstanding banking facilities utilised by the subsidiary companies as at the end of the reporting year.

The Company provides unsecured financial guarantees to banks in respect of banking facilities granted to certain subsidiary companies. The Company monitors on an on-going basis the results of the subsidiary companies and repayments made by the subsidiary companies. As at the end of the reporting year, there was no indication that any subsidiary company would default on repayment.

Financial guarantees have not been recognised since the fair value on initial recognition was not material.

# v. Investments and other financial assets

At the end of the reporting year, the Group and the Company have investments in domestic securities. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amounts in the statements of financial position.

Significant investments are allowed only in liquid securities and only with counterparties that have good credit ratings.

The Group's and the Company's maximum exposure to credit risk for the components of the statements of financial position at the reporting date are their carrying amounts.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023 (CONTINUED)

# 43. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES (CONTINUED)

The main areas of financial risks faced by the Group and the Company and the policies in respect of the major areas of treasury activity are set out as follows (Continued):

# b) Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of the Group's and the Company's financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.

The Group's and the Company's investments in fixed rate debt securities and fixed rate borrowings are exposed to a risk of change in their fair values due to changes in interest rates. The Group's variable rate borrowings are exposed to a risk of change in cash flows due to changes in interest rates. Short-term receivables and payables are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk.

The interest rate profile of the Group's and the Company's significant interest-bearing financial instruments, based on carrying amounts as at the end of the reporting year is as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">GROUP</td><td colspan="2">COMPANY</td></tr><tr><td>2023 
RM&#x27;000</td><td>2022 
RM&#x27;000</td><td>2023 
RM&#x27;000</td><td>2022 
RM&#x27;000</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed rate instruments</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Fixed deposits with licensed banks</td><td>206,106</td><td>232,070</td><td>33,008</td><td>30,987</td></tr><tr><td>Lease liabilities</td><td>431</td><td>716</td><td>259</td><td>406</td></tr><tr><td>Borrowings</td><td>212</td><td>256</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr></table>

The Group and the Company do not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, and the Group and the Company do not designate derivatives as hedging instruments under a fair value hedge accounting model. Therefore, a change in interest rates at the end of the reporting year would not affect profit or loss.

# c) Market risk

The Group's and the Company's principal exposure to market risk arises from changes in value caused by movements in market prices of their quoted equity investments. The risk of loss is minimised via thorough analysis before investing and continuous monitoring of the performance of the investments.

Common to all businesses, the overall performance of the Group's and the Company's investments are also driven externally by global and domestic economies that are largely unpredictable and uncontrollable.

# d) Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group or the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as and when they fall due, due to shortage of funds.

The Group and the Company seek to ensure all business units maintain optimum levels of liquidity at all times, sufficient for their operating, investing and financing activities.

Therefore, the policy seeks to ensure that each business unit, through efficient working capital management (i.e. inventories, accounts receivable and accounts payable management), must be able to convert its current assets into cash to meet all demands for payment as and when they fall due.

# 43. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES (CONTINUED)

The main areas of financial risks faced by the Group and the Company and the policies in respect of the major areas of treasury activity are set out as follows (Continued):

# d) Liquidity risk (Continued)

Owing to the nature of the businesses, the Group and the Company seek to maintain sufficient credit lines available to meet the liquidity requirements while ensuring an effective working capital management within the Group and the Company.

The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group's and the Company's financial liabilities at the reporting date based on contractual undiscounted repayment obligations:

* This exposure to liquidity risk is included for illustration purpose only as the related guarantees have not yet crystallised.

# e) Foreign currency risk

Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.

The Company is exposed to foreign currency risk on fixed deposits with licensed banks that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Company. The currency giving rise to this risk is primarily Australian Dollar ("AUD").

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023 (CONTINUED)

# 43. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES (CONTINUED)

The main areas of financial risks faced by the Group and the Company and the policies in respect of the major areas of treasury activity are set out as follows (Continued):

# e) Foreign currency risk (Continued)

The Company's exposure to foreign currency risk, based on carrying amounts at the end of the reporting date were as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">GROUP AND COMPANY</td></tr><tr><td>2023 
RM&#x27;000</td><td>2022 
RM&#x27;000</td></tr><tr><td>Denominated in AUD:</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Fixed deposits with licensed banks</td><td>27,587</td><td>25,604</td></tr></table>

A  $3.98\%$  (2022:  $0.70\%$ ) strengthening of the AUD against the functional currency of the Group and of the Company at the end of reporting period would increase or decrease profit for the financial year/total equity as shown in the table below, this analysis assumes that all other variables held constant.

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">GROUP AND COMPANY</td></tr><tr><td>2023 
RM&#x27;000</td><td>2022 
RM&#x27;000</td></tr><tr><td>AUD/RM</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Increase/(Decrease):</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Profit for the financial year/Total equity</td><td>1,098</td><td>179</td></tr></table>

A  $3.98\%$  (2022:  $0.70\%$ ) weakening of the AUD against the functional currency of the Group at the end of reporting period would have equal but opposite effect to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables held constant.

# 44. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

The Group's objectives when managing capital is to maintain a strong capital base and safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business. The Directors monitor and determine an optimal debt-to-equity ratio that complies with debt covenants and regulatory requirements.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023 (CONTINUED)

# 44. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)

The Group's strategy is to maintain the debt-to-equity ratio between  $10\%$  to  $25\%$ . The debt-to-equity ratio at the reporting date is as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">GROUP AND COMPANY</td></tr><tr><td>2023 
RM&#x27;000</td><td>2022 
RM&#x27;000</td></tr><tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents</td><td>1,845,952</td><td>2,163,205</td></tr><tr><td>Less: total borrowings</td><td>(643)</td><td>(972)</td></tr><tr><td>Net cash available</td><td>1,845,309</td><td>2,162,233</td></tr><tr><td>Equity attributable to the owners of the Company</td><td>5,413,096</td><td>5,741,425</td></tr><tr><td>Debt-to-equity ratio (%)</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr></table>

There were no changes in the Group's approach to capital management during the financial year.

# 45. FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

The Group has established policies and procedures in respect of the fair value measurement.

Financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis

Certain financial assets of the Group and the Company are measured at fair value at the end of the reporting year. Details of fair value measurement of those financial assets are as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">Fair value</td><td rowspan="2">Fair

There is no transfer between the fair value hierarchies during the financial year.

The carrying amounts of other financial assets and financial liabilities of the Group and of the Company at the reporting date approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature or immaterial discounting impact.

The proposed Resolution 6 will give the Directors of the Company the flexibility to issue and allot new shares in the Company up to an amount not exceeding in total  $10\%$  of the issued share capital of the Company for such purposes as the Directors consider would be in the interest of the Company.

# NOTICE OF THE TWENTIETH ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING (CONTINUED)

The Company continues to consider opportunities to enhance the earnings potential of the Company and if such opportunities involve the issuance of new shares, the Directors would have to convene a general meeting to approve the issuance of new shares even though the number involved may be less than  $10\%$  of the issued share capital. In order to avoid any delay and costs involved in convening a general meeting to approve the issuance of new shares, it is thus considered appropriate that the Directors be empowered to issue new shares in the Company, up to an amount not exceeding in total  $10\%$  of the issued share capital of the Company at any time, for such purposes.

The authority for the allotment of new shares will provide flexibility to the Company for any potential fund raising activities, including but not limited to placement of shares, for purpose of funding future investments, working capital and/or acquisition. This authority will expire at the next AGM, unless revoked or varied at a general meeting. As at the date of this notice, there were no shares issued pursuant to the mandate obtained in the last AGM.

4. Resolution 7 - Authority to Issue Shares pursuant to the DRS

The proposed Resolution 7 will give the Directors of the Company the authority to allot and issue new shares in the Company for the DRS in respect of the dividend declared at this AGM and subsequently until the next AGM.

5. Resolution 8, Resolution 9 and Resolution 10 - General Mandate for Recurrent Related Party Transactions

The proposed Resolution 8, 9, and 10, if passed, will allow the Company and its subsidiary companies to enter into recurrent related party transactions of a revenue and trading nature. The details of these proposals are set out in the Circular to Shareholders dated 29 April 2024, which is despatched together with the Annual Report for the financial year ended 31 December 2023.

6. Resolution 11 - Proposed Renewal of Share Buy-Back Authority

The proposed Resolution 11, if passed, will empower the Directors to buy-back and/or hold up to a maximum of  $10\%$  of the total number of issued shares (excluding treasury shares) of the Company at the time of purchase. Details of this proposal is set out in the Circular to Shareholders dated 29 April 2024, which is despatched together with the Annual Report for the financial year ended 31 December 2023.
