# SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE

Strong governance is the foundation of our sustainability approach. We have established a structured framework to integrate sustainability into our business strategy, aligning it with industry best practices, regulatory requirements and stakeholder expectations.

The Risk & Governance Committee guides FEHB's sustainability oversight, reporting directly to the Board of Directors. The Risk & Governance Division is responsible for implementing sustainability initiatives, monitoring ESG performance and driving continuous improvement across business operations.

![](images/8a9b472b81e69c5d536b18a4db779d49ba36cfef70d88f382b2ecf38e901554a.jpg)  
Risk & Sustainability Committee (Board Level) convenes meeting twice yearly, increasing to quarterly effective 2025 for enhanced oversight. The Top Management Level meeting remains twice biannually to ensure effective sustainability implementation.

# DOUBLE MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT AT FEHB

FEHB recognises that sustainability is not just about managing environmental and social impacts. It also influences financial performance and long-term business resilience. Ensuring a focus on the most material issues, we conducted a double materiality assessment, identifying the sustainability topics most significant from both an Economic, Environmental, and Social ("EES") impact perspective and a financial risk and opportunity perspective.

# STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND SURVEY OBJECTIVES

Capturing a comprehensive view of material topics, we launched a survey to engage with various internal and external stakeholders. This assessment aimed to:-

- Identify key ESG issues impacting FEHB's operations, sustainability commitments and broader industry landscape.  
- Assess the financial significance of these issues concerning our long-term business strategy and risk management.  
- Align stakeholder priorities with our corporate sustainability approach.

The survey was distributed to all key stakeholder groups, ensuring a diverse range of perspectives on both ESG impacts and financial materiality.

# TWO-TIERED PERSPECTIVE: ESG & FINANCIAL MATERIALITY

A key feature of our double materiality approach was the inclusion of our Board of Directors, who provided input from both an environmental and social impact perspective and a financial perspective.

- ESG Materiality: The impact of sustainability-related issues on the environment, communities, employees and business ethics.  
- Financial Materiality: The financial risks and opportunities associated with these ESG topics, including regulatory risks, operational efficiency, market positioning and cost implications.

This approach ensures a balanced assessment, allowing FEHB to address the most critical sustainability issues while integrating these factors into risk management and financial planning.

# WHY THIS APPROACH?

Adopting a double materiality framework provides several key advantages:-

- Stronger Corporate Governance: Aligns sustainability with financial risk management, improving long-term decision-making.  
- Regulatory Preparedness: Helps FEHB meet evolving global reporting standards, including IFRS S1 & S2, GRI and other ESG disclosure frameworks.  
Stakeholder-Centric Strategy: Ensures that FEHB's sustainability efforts align with stakeholder priorities, fostering transparency and accountability.  
- Financial & Reputational Resilience: Identifies business risks and opportunities, enhancing financial resilience and market positioning.

# DID YOU KNOW?

FEHB is doing its part to reduce pesticide use and its associated GHG emissions in a natural way! We cultivate plants like Turnera subulata, Cassia cobanensis, Euphorbia heterophylla, and Antigonon leptopus to help control bagworm infestations.

These plants attract parasitoid-little creatures like Sycanus dichotomus, Dolichogenidea metesae, Psyllalia and Diachasmimorpha-which are natural predators that help keep the bagworm population in check. This simple, eco-friendly solution makes a big difference in our sustainability efforts!

# WATER MANAGEMENT

Water is a critical resource for FEHB's operations and essential for plantation sustainability and milling processes. As part of our commitment to responsible water stewardship, we actively manage water consumption, conservation and quality to minimise environmental impact and ensure the long-term availability of this resource.

FEHB reduces reliance on municipal water by sourcing from various channels, including:

Municipal supply for office and estate facilities  
- Treated surface water from lakes and rivers  
- Bore wells near estates to supplement supply during dry periods

To optimise water use and minimise waste, FEHB implements targeted conservation measures:-

Water retention ponds and tube wells ensure a stable water supply, reducing dependence on municipal sources  
- Rainwater harvesting at the office compound supplements non-potable water needs, cutting reliance on treated water  
- On estates, water sumps, weirs and bunds enhance water retention, preserving soil moisture and supporting sustainable plantation practices, particularly during dry seasons

Protecting water quality remains a top priority. FEHB conducts regular water quality analyses, sending river and tube well samples to external laboratories for assessment. Since our estates share rivers with local communities, we implement strict controls to prevent contamination from effluent discharge, ensuring compliance with environmental regulations and safeguarding shared water resources.

FEHB's Group Water Consumption for year 2024:

<table><tr><td>Water Consumption</td><td>Unit</td><td>2024</td><td>2023</td></tr><tr><td>Bursa C9(a) Total volume of water used</td><td>Megalitres</td><td>687.813</td><td>1,642.166</td></tr></table>

# SOCIAL

FEHB views employees and the surrounding communities as an integral part of its extended family. We embed our commitment to their growth, well-being and success in our company values. The foundation of our success lies in developing our people, who invest in their personal and professional development. Career growth opportunities, training programmes and a safe, supportive work environment empower individuals to reach their full potential, creating a culture of mutual respect, trust and collaboration.

# ADDRESSGENDER DISPARITY IN OPERATIONS

We recognise the gender disparity in certain areas of operations, such as plantation work, where physical tasks like harvesting and estate maintenance are often perceived as more suitable for men. While these roles have traditionally been male-dominated, we are committed to diversifying job roles and identifying appropriate opportunities for female workers.

By introducing and encouraging more gender-inclusive roles, we challenge gender stereotypes and ensure equal opportunities for all employees. Education, awareness and ongoing efforts break down barriers and create a more gender-balanced workforce.

# CONTINUOUS SUPPORT FOR CAREER DEVELOPMENT

A genuinely inclusive workplace goes beyond diversity-it involves providing equal opportunities for all employees to grow, advance and thrive. We are committed to ensure that every individual has the support they need to reach their full potential within the organisation. Our efforts empower women and support other underrepresented groups, fostering a culture where everyone feels valued and included.

We strive to create an environment where career development is accessible to all. Training programmes, mentorship opportunities and tailored professional growth initiatives equip employees with the skills and resources they need to excel. Our commitment extends to offering leadership development opportunities that help break barriers and advance individuals into leadership roles, regardless of gender or background.

When our people are supported, valued and empowered, they are more likely to contribute to the company's success and feel a more profound sense of belonging. Moving forward, we will continue to expand these initiatives, ensuring that every employee, particularly women and underrepresented groups, has the opportunity to thrive and succeed within the organisation.

Far East Holdings Berhad ("FEHB") or ("the Group") is pleased to present its Management Discussion and Analysis for the financial year ended 31 December 2024 ("FY2024"). This analysis highlights FEHB's ongoing commitment to economic, environmental and social sustainability as it navigates the evolving landscape of the palm oil industry.

# Overview of Business and Operations

FEHB remains steadfast in its core activities: the cultivation of oil palms and the production and sale of fresh fruit bunches (FFB), crude palm oil (CPO) and palm kernel (PK), as well as investment holdings. Operations span thirteen (13) estates across the Pahang State, including Bukit Jin Estate, Chengal Estate, Sungai Rasau Estate, Sungai Seraya Estate, Sungai Batu Estate, DSK Estate, Cenderawasih Estate, Sungai Sawak Estate, Bukit Serok Estate, Dawn Estate, Cempaka Estate, Delima Estate and Rangkaian Estate.

In FY2024, FEHB continued to strengthen its plantation operations amidst a dynamic market environment. The Group's commitment to sustainable practices remained unwavering, with all estates maintaining the Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) certification, enhancing the Group's competitive edge in securing premium prices for CPO and PK.

The Group operates three (3) palm oil mills: Kilang Kosfarm Sdn. Bhd., Wujud Wawasan Sdn. Bhd. and the newly acquired Merchong Palm Oil Mill Sdn. Bhd. located in the State of Pahang.

# Area Statement

As at 31 December 2024, approximately  $95\%$  of the total planted oil palm is classified as mature. The age profile of the Group's palm oil trees for FY2024 is as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">Particulars</td><td colspan="2">2024</td><td colspan="2">2023</td><td colspan="2">2022</td></tr><tr><td>Hectare</td><td>%</td><td>Hectare</td><td>%</td><td>Hectare</td><td>%</td></tr><tr><td>&gt;24 years (very old palms)</td><td>354</td><td>2</td><td>532</td><td>3</td><td>696</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>20-24 years (old palms)</td><td>2,318</td><td>12</td><td>2,179</td><td>12</td><td>1,757</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>7-19 years (prime palms)</td><td>14,021</td><td>75</td><td>13,091</td><td>69</td><td>13,322</td><td>71</td></tr><tr><td>4-6 years (young palms)</td><td>1,211</td><td>6</td><td>2,137</td><td>11</td><td>1,761</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>1-3 years (immature)</td><td>904</td><td>5</td><td>959</td><td>5</td><td>1,373</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>18,808</td><td>100</td><td>18,898</td><td>100</td><td>18,909</td><td>100</td></tr></table>

# Management Discussion And Analysis (Cont'd)

# FFB Production

The year saw a commendable increase in Fresh Fruit Bunches (FFB) production, totalling 382,156 metric tonnes (MT), a  $31\%$  rise from 292,663 MT in 2023. FEHB attributes this improvement to favourable weather conditions and the implementation of best agricultural practices. Notably, the Group produced 116,403 MT of FFB in the third quarter of the year, the peak harvesting period. The Group's FFB yield stood at 21.34 MT per hectare, surpassing the regional averages in Pahang State and Peninsular Malaysia at 18.28 MT per hectare and 18.42 MT per hectare respectively.

In FY2024, the average CPO price realised was RM4,208 per MT, exceeding RM3,802 per MT in 2023. Similarly, the average PK price increased to RM2,682 per MT from RM2,018 in the previous year.

The upward trend in prices was driven by resilient global demand, tight supply of alternative vegetable oils and currency fluctuations. Although palm oil output and inventories expanded in major producing countries, strong buying interest from key importers and reduced availability of soybean and sunflower oils continued to support prices. Additionally, geopolitical tensions and volatility in energy markets added to overall uncertainty, contributing to sustained price strength for palm-based products.

The acquisition of Merchong Palm Oil Mill Sdn. Bhd. (MPOM) represented a significant milestone in 2024. This strategic move expanded the Group's milling capacity, with MPOM operating a 60 MT per hour mill. FEHB expects the integration of MPOM to enhance operational efficiency and provide greater processing flexibility for the Group's FFB output.

# Group Financial Review

The Group's financial position remained robust, with revenue reaching RM863.59 million in FY2024, a 59% increase from RM542.36 million in 2023. Profit before tax was RM252.76 million, significantly higher (95%) than the RM129.46 million reported in the previous year.

# Revenue

This revenue growth was primarily driven by:

- Higher Average CPO and PK Prices: The average CPO and PK prices per MT increased by  $11\%$  and  $33\%$ , respectively. The average CPO price per MT was RM4,208 (2023: RM3,802), while the average PK price per MT was RM2,682 (2023: RM2,018).  
Higher FFB Production: The Group's FFB production rose by  $31\%$ , amounting to 89,493 MT.  
- Higher FFB Processed: The volume of FFB processed by the Group's mills increased by  $55\%$ , reflecting enhanced operational efficiency.

# Profit Before Tax

The improved profitability is mainly due to:

Higher Average CPO and PK Prices by 11% and 33%, respectively;  
Higher Share of Profit After Tax from Associates: RM17.29 million, which represents a  $37\%$  increase from the previous year;  
Higher FFB production by 89,493 MT (31%); and  
Higher FFB processed from milling operations by 242,190 MT (55%).

This steady performance reflects the Group's resilience and effective cost management strategies amidst ongoing market volatilities. The growth was primarily driven by higher production volumes and improved operational efficiencies.

Recognising its strong financial position, the Board declared an interim single tier dividend of five (5) sen per share in August 2024, followed by a special interim single tier dividend of seven (7) sen per share in November 2024, underscoring the Group's commitment to delivering value to shareholders.

# Plantation Operations

In FY2024, FEHB achieved notable improvements in its plantation operations, addressing prior challenges such as labour shortages and other factors affecting yields. The Group benefited from improved market conditions, strategic cost management and targeted operational enhancements, which collectively contributed to higher productivity and improved profitability.

Plantation is the Group's core business, focused on oil palm cultivation and palm oil processing, including nursery management, cultivation and crop oil extraction. Key performance indicators are as follows:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Unit</td><td>2024</td><td>2023</td><td>2022</td></tr><tr><td>FFB Production</td><td>MT</td><td>382,156</td><td>292,663</td><td>327,769</td></tr><tr><td>CPO Production</td><td>MT</td><td>73,005</td><td>55,670</td><td>61,598</td></tr><tr><td>FFB Yield</td><td>MT/ha</td><td>21.34</td><td>16.31</td><td>18.69</td></tr><tr><td>CPO Yield</td><td>MT/ha</td><td>4.08</td><td>3.10</td><td>3.51</td></tr><tr><td>Average OER for CPO</td><td>%</td><td>19.10</td><td>19.02</td><td>18.79</td></tr><tr><td>Average CPO Price</td><td>RM/MT</td><td>4,208</td><td>3,802</td><td>4,897</td></tr><tr><td>Average PK Price</td><td>RM/MT</td><td>2,682</td><td>2,018</td><td>2,953</td></tr><tr><td>Mature Area</td><td>Hectare</td><td>17,904</td><td>17,939</td><td>17,536</td></tr><tr><td>Total Planted Area</td><td>Hectare</td><td>18,808</td><td>18,898</td><td>18,909</td></tr></table>

The Group recorded an average FFB cost of RM248 per MT,  $24\%$  lower than RM326 per MT in the previous year. Higher FFB production and lower fertiliser cost mainly led to a cost reduction in FY2024. The Group closely monitors operating expenses at the estate level as part of its cost control initiatives. Regarding operational efficiency, the Group achieved an average OER for CPO of  $19.10\%$ .

# Management Discussion And Analysis (Cont'd)

Adopting precision agriculture techniques, including drone-assisted monitoring and data-driven agronomic decisions, optimised resource allocation and yield. Furthermore, enhanced recruitment strategies and comprehensive training programmes strengthened the workforce to deliver a stable labour supply and improved productivity.

Sustainability remained a key priority, with an intensified focus on integrating eco-friendly practices across its estates. In 2024, the Group advanced its sustainable agricultural initiatives by reinforcing its zero-burning replanting strategy, promoting biodiversity conservation and enhancing its waste management framework, including using palm biomass for renewable energy. Qualified agronomists and planting advisors conducted rigorous assessments to evaluate nutrient balance, soil health, pest and disease control and water management, providing optimal growing conditions. These measures resulted in a more efficient fertilisation programme and improved palm oil quality, reaffirming FEHB's commitment to responsible and sustainable palm oil production.

# Replanting

FEHB remains committed to sustainable replanting practices to enhance long-term agronomic productivity. The Group continued its structured replanting programmes to create optimal crop age profiles for improved yields.

In FY2024, FEHB replanted 295.30 hectares (729.69 acres), reflecting ongoing efforts to rejuvenate plantation areas and maintain productivity. The Group has scheduled 1,061.60 hectares (2,623.21 acres) for replanting between 2025 and 2029, reinforcing its dedication to sustainable growth and operational efficiency.

<table><tr><td colspan="2">Replanting Program</td></tr><tr><td>Year</td><td>Area (Hectares)</td></tr><tr><td>2022</td><td>210.51</td></tr><tr><td>2023</td><td>179.30</td></tr><tr><td>2024</td><td>295.30</td></tr></table>

# Milling Operations

Milling remains a vital part of operations, contributing  $81\%$  of the Group's revenue for FY2024. The Group operates three (3) palm oil mills: Kilang Kosfarm Sdn. Bhd. ("KKSB"), Wujud Wawasan Sdn. Bhd. ("WWSB") and Merchong Palm Oil Mill Sdn. Bhd. ("MPOM"), each with a 60 MT per hour processing capacity. KKSB and MPOM have obtained International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC), reinforcing FEHB's commitment to sustainable palm oil production.

The Group's revenue from milling operations for FY2024 was RM698.22 million, a  $73\%$  increase from FY2023 (RM403.63 million), mainly due to higher CPO and PK prices, higher CPO and PK sold and improved operational efficiency. However, market fluctuations in CPO and PK prices impacted overall revenue gains.

KKSB, WWSB and MPOM processed 680,040 MT of FFB in FY2024,  $55\%$  more than the 437,850 MT in FY2023. Favourable weather conditions and optimum agricultural implemented across the Group's estates supported the higher processing volume. The mills achieved an average Oil Extraction Rate (OER) of  $20.08\%$  for CPO and  $5.04\%$  for PK, reflecting a slight decrease from FY2023 (CPO OER:  $20.17\%$ , PK ER:  $5.27\%$ ).

The Group's mills continue to supply CPO to Future Prelude Sdn. Bhd. ("FPSB"), an associate company specialising in palm oil refining, oleochemicals and biodiesel production. FPSB utilises sustainable palm oil as feedstock to produce Refined Bleached and Deodorised Palm Oil ("RBD PO"), Refined Bleached and Deodorized Palm Kernel Oil ("RBD PKO"), Palm Methyl Ester ("PME" or "Biodiesel"), Glycerine ("Tech Grade" and "Pharmaceutical Grade") and Palm Fatty Acid Distillate ("PFAD").

# Prospect for 2025 and Beyond

As FEHB moves into 2025, it navigates an increasingly complex operating environment marked by geopolitical tensions, economic uncertainties and climate-related risks. Volatile crude palm oil (CPO) prices, rising operational costs and shifting trade policies remain key challenges. Given the ongoing fluctuations in the global palm oil market, maintaining financial resilience and operational efficiency will be critical.

Global supply-demand dynamics, policy changes in major importing countries and currency fluctuations affect CPO prices. In FY2024, FEHB realised an average CPO price of RM4,208 per MT, an 11% increase from RM3,802 per MT in FY2023. However, price volatility remains a significant risk factor for revenue stability. A RM100 per MT change in CPO price is estimated to impact revenue by approximately RM8.7 million. Strengthening its market positioning through offtake agreements, maintaining ISCC certification to secure premium pricing and enhancing cost management strategies to preserve margins help mitigate this risk.

Climate change continues to affect operational challenges, with prolonged dry spells and erratic rainfall affecting plantation yields. FEHB is increasing efforts in sustainable agriculture, focusing on soil health restoration, regenerative farming techniques and improved water management. Investments in digital agronomy solutions, such as precision monitoring and AI-driven yield forecasting, will support climate resilience and operational efficiency.

Labour shortages remain a persistent industry challenge, particularly with the increasing regulatory scrutiny on foreign worker policies. FEHB addresses this through workforce development initiatives, enhanced mechanisation and the gradual integration of automation in harvesting and milling operations. These measures require upfront investment, however, they will increase long-term productivity and reduce dependency on manual labour.

Regulatory risks, particularly sustainability-linked trade policies, also shape the industry outlook. The European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) and other emerging trade barriers could impact market access. FEHB is reinforcing its traceability measures and expanding its sustainability certifications to align with global compliance standards. Engagement with regulatory bodies and industry associations remains a priority to ensure adaptability to evolving requirements.

Despite macroeconomic pressures, including high interest rates and currency fluctuations, FEHB remains confident in its long-term strategy. Focusing on disciplined cost management, strategic investments and a commitment to sustainability positions the Group well to navigate industry headwinds and deliver value to stakeholders in 2025 and beyond.

Group Risk Management Framework

# RESPONSIBILITIES AND ACCOUNTABILITIES

# Board of Directors

The Group is led by the Board. The Board affirms its overall responsibility for the Group's system of internal controls, including the assurance of its adequacy and integrity, and its alignment with business objectives. The Board is committed to maintaining a sound system of internal control to safeguard shareholders' investment and the Group's assets and to review its adequacy and integrity periodically. The system of internal control covers a broad spectrum of end to end business processes encompassing both the financial and non-financial risks.

The Board also recognises that a sound system of internal controls can only mitigate risks, but acknowledges its limitations in eliminating the possibility of poor judgement in decision making, human error, control process being deliberately circumvented by employees, management overriding controls and the occurrence of unforeseeable circumstances. Accordingly, the system could provide only reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement, operational failures, fraud or loss.

Board Committees such as the Audit Committee, Risk and Governance Committee, Nomination and Remuneration Committee and Tender Committee are established by the Board, and are governed by clearly defined Terms of Reference and authority for areas within their respective scope.

# RESPONSIBILITIES AND ACCOUNTABILITIES (CONT'D)

# Audit Committee

The Audit Committee is responsible for assisting the Board in fulfilling its statutory and fiduciary responsibilities of monitoring the Group's financial risk management processes. The Audit Committee is also responsible for reviewing the Group's business process, the quality of the Group's accounting function, financial reporting and the system of internal controls and enhancing the independence of both the external and internal auditors.

The composition of the Audit Committee comprises solely of Independent Non-Executive Directors. The independence and financial literacy of its members are paramount in a well-functioning Audit Committee to ensure its members in exercise an informed and impartial judgement in the fulfilment of the Audit Committee's mandate.

The Internal Audit Function adopts a risk-based approach and is independent of the activities they audit. Their work is based on an annual audit plan approved by the Audit Committee. In order to ensure independence, the Chief Internal Auditor reports directly to the Audit Committee. Audit Committee meetings are convened once every quarter or as and when required.

# Risk and Governance Committee

Risk and Governance Committee has been separately formed as Board Committee. The primary objective of the Risk and Governance Committee is to assist the Board in discharging its statutory and fiduciary responsibilities by identifying significant risks and opportunities and ensuring that the Group Risk Management Framework incorporates the necessary policies and mechanisms to manage the overall risk exposures of the Group. The Committee is also responsible to oversee the Group's Sustainability or interchangeably, environmental, social and governance related framework, strategy, external commitments, policies and practices as well as performances against relevant benchmarks such as external ESG rating or assessments.

The Risk and Governance Committee comprises majority Non-Executive Directors. The composition of the Committee during the period under review was made in accordance with the Terms of Reference. The profile of each member of the Risk and Governance Committee is set out in the Directors' Profile section. During the financial year ended 31 December 2024, the Risk and Governance Committee held a total of two (2) meetings.

# Risk Management Framework and Internal Controls

The Board with the assistance of the Risk and Governance Committee and management undertook to identify the principal business risks in the critical areas of the Group. This involved assessing the likelihood of material exposures and identifying the appropriate safeguards to be taken and the required time frame to mitigate and minimise the impact of these risks. This was done through discussion and meetings at estates and senior management levels. The results of updated risks profiles were further deliberated by the Risk and Governance Committee prior to escalation to the Board.

# Risk Management Framework and Internal Control (Cont'd)

The details of principal risks reviewed and strategies adopted by the Board to mitigate the impact of the risks are as follows:

# (1) Over-Dependence on Foreign Worker

Highly reliance on foreign workers had disrupted the oil palm industry as the Group experienced during the Covid-19 pandemic when the international borders were closed. It caused severe labour shortages and significantly affected the FFB production.

The recent increase of foreign workers significantly enhances Malaysia's oil palm production. This increase is in line with the implementation of quota opening and the country's Labor Recalibration Program ("RTK") 2.0 which allows employers to hire foreign workers until 31 May 2024.

FEHB has started to reduce their reliance on foreign workers by maximising the usage of mechanisation as well as enhancing local workforce participation. The total machines (i.e.: Ginga, Crawlers, Timac, Mini Dumper, Mini Tractor and High-Lift Tractor) have been used within Group totaling 166 units. The number of foreign workers until 31 December 2024 was 1,044 persons. The statistics of harvesters for the Group are shown below: -

![](images/d74e4f31f216106f63dd5c0f28957aac85e97a0a512ca3e0b134d26cb72cc263.jpg)

FEHB has initiated the following strategies to optimise the productivity as well as to retain the workers:-

(a) Maximise the usage of semi-mechanisation in-fields fruits collection and manuring;  
(b) Gradually replacing all the non-critical jobs or tasks to local workers such as loose fruit collectors, line sweeper and cleaner;  
(c) To bear the cost of extending the work permit for workers in Year 10 and for two additional years (Year 11 and Year 12);  
(d) Creating incentive scheme to reward workers based upon operation-oriented performances and renewal of their permit with Immigration Department of Malaysia;  
(e) Improve estates' infrastructure and facilities; and  
(f) Compliance to the Malaysia Labour Act (Employment Act 1955).

# (2) Unfavourable Weather Condition

Rainfall significantly impacts oil palm production with optimal yields occurring when there is a consistent moderate amount of rain throughout the year. However, both excessive rainfall and prolonged dry periods could negatively affect fruit production by hindering pollination, causing waterlogging and stressing the plants which ultimately reducing the yield of Fresh Fruit Bunches ("FFB").

Several estates recorded unusual annual rainfall patterns. The following are the negative impacts of heavy rain: -

(a) Excessive rainfall would lead to waterlogging in plantations, hindering root function and impacting fruit set;  
(b) Heavy rain would result in harvesting operations difficult due to flooded areas which impacting fruit collection efficiency; and  
(c) Waterlogged conditions could increase the risk of fungal diseases affecting the plants.

To mitigate the impacts, the Group has carried out initiatives by desilting of drains and construction of new drains, maintaining the culverts, installed drainage blocks, construction the bunds in low lying or flood prone areas and construction of bridges for better access routes. The roads have been maintained in good condition to ensure that all roads are passable and no disruption on transportation of FFB. The Group also has carried out an initiative by ensuring timely application of fertiliser as well as utilisation of Empty Fruit Bunch ("EFB") to reduce moisture loss.

# (3) Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG")

There is a growing focus on ESG practices in the palm oil industry with Malaysia being one of the world's largest palm oil producers at the forefront of this movement. The country has pledged to conserve biodiversity and prevent illegal deforestation by committing to maintain at least  $50\%$  forest cover. Based on the Fourth National Communication Report to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,  $54.9\%$  of Malaysia remains forested as of December 2023.

FEHB efforts align with international treaties and national standards. FEHB has been certified with the Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil ("MSPO") and International Sustainability and Carbon Certification ("ISCC") certification scheme. This certification mandates no deforestation and safeguards High Conservation Value ("HCV") areas, primary forests and regions with significant carbon stocks. It also set a "No Deforestation" cut-off date of 31 December 2019.

Central to this discourse is the role of biodiversity conservation in oil palm plantations. According to the Malaysian Palm Oil Council ("MPOC"), palm oil companies in the country are increasingly integrating biodiversity conservation into their operations, reflecting a broader awareness of the link between healthy ecosystems and sustainable agriculture. By adhering to MSPO and ISCC standards, The Group demonstrate commitment towards environmental stewardship and responsible industry practices.

Conservation area is another key strategy used to preserve degraded lands and enhance biodiversity. An area of 121.41 hectares at Sungai Sawak Estate had been declared as conservation area, aligned with the Group commitment towards the preservation of High Conservation Value ("HCV"). The conservation area also helps to establish wildlife corridors which facilitate the movement of animals between fragmented forest patches, reducing the risk of isolated populations and ensuring genetic diversity. These are also one of Group effort in combating habitat fragmentation caused by oil palm cultivation.

# (3) Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG") (Cont'd)

The Group has conducted HCV and Land Use Change Analysis ("LUCA") assessment as our preparation towards Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil ("RSPO") certification. The assessment is conducted to identify and protect environmentally sensitive areas before any new land development, particularly in industries like palm oil production to ensure that areas with high biodiversity or critical ecosystem functions are not cleared for cultivation, thereby promoting sustainable land management practices and minimising environmental impact.

Another effort towards sustainable oil palm cultivation practices is by implementing the oil palm pollination weevil to increase the fruit set and fresh fruit bunch yield. This pollination trial has been started at Sungai Batu Estate.

Environmental stewardship is increasingly valued by consumers, investors, regulators and communities. By committing to biodiversity and communicating sustainability efforts, it helps the Group to build credibility and strengthen relationships with key stakeholders.

As the palm oil sector continues to evolve, the integration of biodiversity conservation into ESG strategies will remain a key pillar for sustainable growth. By prioritising biodiversity, the Group is not only contributing to the health and resilience of ecosystems but also building trust and credibility among stakeholders. The ongoing efforts to address challenges and leverage opportunities will shape the future of the industry, ensuring that palm oil cultivation and environmental conservation go hand in hand.

# (4) Pest and Disease

Bagworms impact palm oil production by causing substantial leaf defoliation on oil palm trees, leading to reduced photosynthesis and ultimately a significant drop in the yield of palm oil. With infestations resulting in up to  $40\%$  crop losses, this is considered a major pest in palm oil plantations due to their rapid breeding and ability to heavily damage foliage when populations outbreak. The total bagworms treatment as at 31 December 2024 was 354.10 hectares. Another Group's mitigation action by planting beneficial plants. There were 1,851 chains of beneficial plants planted as at 31 December 2024.

Rats impact palm oil production by feeding on the ripe and unripe fruits of oil palm trees causing substantial damage to the fruit bunches and leading to a significant decrease in oil yield. In severe infestations, rat populations can reduce palm oil production by up to  $10\%$  due to their consumption of the fleshy part of the fruit and potentially accessing the kernel as well as impacting the overall harvest quality. The Group conducted census promptly to ensure early detection and performed a rat baiting program covering 91 percent of total hectarages.

Ganoderma Boninense impacts palm oil production by causing a disease called Basal Stem Rot ("BSR") which can drastically reduce the yield of oil palm trees up to a  $50 - 80\%$  decrease in production due to infected trees producing fewer and smaller fruit bunches. This will ultimately cause substantial economic losses to palm oil plantations. The initiative taken to mitigate this impact by implementing mounding method for affected areas at Bukit Jin Estate, Sungai Seraya Estate, Sungai Sawak Estate and Rangkaian Estate.

(5) Yield Determining Factors in Oil Palm

# Climate Change

Climate change is significantly impacting palm oil yield by causing more extreme weather events like droughts, floods and heat waves. It disrupts rainfall patterns and increasing temperatures which lead to reduce oil palms production and overall lower palm oil yields. With rising temperatures being particularly detrimental, potentially causing a decrease in production by  $10\% - 41\%$  depending on the degree of warming.

Higher temperatures can stress oil palms, hindering growth and fruits development which lead to reduced yields. Unpredictable rainfall patterns including droughts and heavy downpours can negatively impact the water availability needed for optimal oil palms growth.

# Labour Shortage

A shortage of labour supply significantly impacts oil palm yield by reducing the efficiency of harvesting FFB. This led to lower overall production as crucial tasks like harvesting and collection are not completed promptly potentially causing fruits to overripen and decrease oil extraction rates. This is particularly problematic in regions which heavily reliant on manual labour for palm oil production.

# Soil Suitability

Peat soil impact oil palm yield by generally producing lower yields compared to other soil types due to its poor fertility, high water content and susceptibility to subsidence when drained. These criteria can lead to flooding and hinder root development. However, proper management practices can mitigate these issues and achieve yields comparable to other soil types.

Drainage of peatlands for oil palm cultivation can lead to peat oxidation which it releases large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Proper management practices including controlled drainage, nutrient supplementation and careful monitoring of water table levels can help maximise oil palm yields on peat soils.

# Nutrients

Nutrients, particularly nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), significantly impact oil palm yield by influencing various aspects of the oil palm growth including leaf production, flower initiation, fruit development and overall plant health. With adequate levels of nutrients, it will lead to higher fruit bunch weight and increased palm oil production. Nutrient deficiencies can severely limit yield potential. By conducting leaf sampling analysis, the Group manage to reduce the impact of nutrient deficiencies throughout all the estates.

# Good Agricultural Practices ("GAP")

GAP significantly increase palm oil yield by optimising factors like soil management, fertilisation, pest and disease control, proper pruning and harvesting techniques. Adhering to GAP will lead to healthier plants and higher fruit production. The Group had carried out soil analysis to obtain the nutrient contain in the soil. The progress of manuring including EFB application, weeding, harvesting and pruning are closely monitored by the estates. FEHB has also established a special task force team to inspect the work of loose fruit collection in each estate.

# (6) Factors Contributing to Oil Losses in CPO

Shortage of labour supply in the palm oil industry significantly impacts crude palm oil production by leading to substantial losses due to unharvested FFB. It will be resulting in reduced oil yield, lower overall production and potential quality issues as ripe fruits are left on the trees for too long. This issue will impact the overall supply of crude palm oil in the market.

Ripeness quality impacts directly towards oil losses in crude palm oil production as overripe fruits tend to experience increase oil degradation and leakage. These will lead to lower oil extraction rates and ultimately higher oil losses during processing. Overripe fruits can easily get damage during harvesting and transportation, causing further oil leakage. Conversely, underripe fruits may not yield the maximum oil potential resulting in suboptimal oil extraction.

Loose fruits contain a substantial amount of oil that goes unprocessed when left on the ground, leading to a direct loss in potential oil extraction and impacting on the overall quality of the produced CPO due to increased Free Fatty Acid ("FFA") content in the remaining collected fruits. Loose fruits left on the plantation floor are not collected and processed, meaning their oil content is completely lost to the production process.

As loose fruits remain on the ground, it will overripe and develop higher FFA levels, which negatively impacts the quality of the harvested FFB and ultimately the final CPO. Leaving loose fruits uncollected can also have environmental implications, as they may decompose and contribute to potential pest problems in the plantation.

Harvesting at the right maturity level is crucial as overripe fruits have a higher oil loss due to increase on degradation and oil leakage. Improper harvesting techniques such as delayed collection of ripe fruit bunches can lead to overripe fruits which results in lower oil extraction rates, increased FFA and ultimately a higher percentage of lost oil in the final product. Essentially, the more efficiently fruits are harvested at optimal ripeness, the less oil is lost during processing.

Mechanisation in the oil palm industry generally reduces oil losses in CPO by enabling faster and more efficient harvesting and processing. It also minimises the time between harvesting and processing, thus preventing oil degradation and maximising oil extraction. However, improper implementation of mechanisation can still lead to oil losses if not fully optimised.

We have audited the financial statements of Far East Holdings Berhad, which comprise the statements of financial position as at 31 December 2024 and the statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows of the Group and of the Company for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a material accounting policy information, as set out on pages 128 to 182.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and of the Company as at 31 December 2024, and of their financial performance and their cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.

# Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Independence and Other Ethical Responsibilities

We are independent of the Group and of the Company in accordance with the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, Conduct and Practice) of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants ("By-Laws") and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) ("IESBA Code"), as applicable to audits of financial statements of public interest entities and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the By-Laws and IESBA Code.

# Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matter that, in our professional judgement, were of the most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on this matter.

The key audit matter for the Group is as follows:

# Equity accounting for associates

As disclosed in Note 12 to the financial statements, the Group has significant interests in associates, including, Prosper Capital Holdings Sdn. Bhd. ("PCH"), which has significant associates of its own and with the existence of substantial cross shareholdings in the Group.

Given the highly complex group structure which involves cross shareholdings, we identified the accounting for equity accounted associates as a key audit matter in view of the risk that the associates may not have been properly accounted for and disclosed appropriately due to the following reasons:

(i) The magnitude of the balances; and  
(ii) The complexity of the group structure where significant time and effort was spent to navigate and examine the group structures of the associates (including its various sub-groups and the financial implications) during our review of the consolidation procedures impacting the Group. The process is further complicated by the varied locations and different management teams involved in the associates.

# Key Audit Matters (cont'd)

Our audit performed and responses thereon

We have performed the following procedures:

- Obtained the larger corporate structure of which the Group is a component and performed reviews on the navigation of the various entities involved and the manner in which the financial results of these various entities are consolidated and/or equity accounted and/or both.  
- Considered the competency, capabilities and relevant industry experience and independence of the component auditors performing the audit work.  
Communicated with various component auditors including the reviews of consolidation and audit files.  
- Issued group audit instructions to component auditors on the scope and nature of their work, including significant areas to be covered, relevant risk of material misstatement and the information to be reported.  
- Performed reviews with regards to the cross shareholdings and the adjustments involving the elimination of the Group's own results as the Group equity accounts for its share of profits of PCH, which has an indirect equity interest in the Group.  
- Performed recomputation of the post-acquisition results in the Group's share of net assets of PCH to ensure that the consolidation adjustments been properly effected.

# Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditors' Report Thereon

The Directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report but does not include the financial statements of the Group and of the Company and our auditors' report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our responsibility is to read the Annual Report and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report the fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Statements

The Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that give a true and fair view in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the Directors are also responsible for assessing the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

# Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

(a) Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.  
(b) Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's and of the Company's internal control.  
(c) Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors.  
(d) Conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.  
(e) Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.  
(f) Plan and perform the group audit to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business units within the group as a basis for forming an opinion on the group financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and review of the audit work performed for purposes of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# 6.1 Material accounting policy information

# (i) Current tax

Tax expense represents the aggregate amount of current and deferred tax. Current tax is the expected amount payable in respect of taxable income for the financial year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date, and any adjustments recognised for prior years' tax. When an item is recognised outside profit or loss, the related tax effect is recognised either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

# 6.1 Material accounting policy information (cont'd)

(ii) Deferred tax

Deferred tax is recognised using the liability method for all temporary differences between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax is not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, which is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the assets are realised or the liabilities are settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that there are sufficient taxable temporary differences relating to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority to offset or when it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can be utilised.

Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefits will be realised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will be available for the assets to be utilised.

Deferred tax assets relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss. Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transactions either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity and deferred tax arising from business combination is adjusted against goodwill on acquisition or the amount of any excess of the acquirer's interest in the net fair value of the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the acquisition cost.

# 7. EARNINGS PER SHARE

(a) Basic

Basic earnings per share of the Group are calculated by dividing the profit after tax attributable to Owners of the Company by the average number of ordinary shares in issue during the financial year.

<table><tr><td></td><td>2024</td><td>2023</td></tr><tr><td>Profit attributable to Owners of the Company (RM&#x27;000)</td><td>190,174</td><td>98,516</td></tr><tr><td>Average number of ordinary shares in issue (unit&#x27;000)</td><td>593,838</td><td>593,838</td></tr><tr><td>Basic earnings per share (sen)</td><td>32.02</td><td>16.59</td></tr></table>

(b) Diluted

Diluted earnings per ordinary share for the financial year is calculated by dividing the profit for the financial year attributable to Owners of the Company by the average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year adjusted for the effects of dilutive potential ordinary shares.

Diluted earnings per share is the same as basic earnings per share as there is no dilutive potential ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year.

# 9. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (cont'd)

Acquisition of property, plant and equipment of the Group and of the Company are satisfied entirely by cash.

# 9.1 Change in estimates

During the financial year ended 31 December 2024, the Group conducted a review of operational efficiency concerning plant and machinery, leading to a change in the expected useful lives of plant and machinery. As a result, the expected useful lives of plant and machinery have been revised from 5 to 10 years to 5 to 20 years. The effect of these changes on depreciation of property, plant and equipment of the Group in current financial year are RM1,329,000. The future effects of this change in estimate have not been quantified because the impact is expected to be immaterial to the financial statements in future periods. The Group has determined that the effects of the change in useful lives will not significantly influence the economic decisions of users of the financial statements.

# 9.2 Material accounting policy information

Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.

(i) Recognition and measurement

Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the assets and any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to working condition for its intended use, cost of replacing component parts of the assets, and the present value of the expected cost for the decommissioning of the assets after their use, if applicable.

The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour. For qualifying assets, borrowing costs are capitalised in accordance with the accounting policy on borrowing costs. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

Plant and machinery are stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses and includes borrowing cost incurred during the period of construction, if any. No depreciation is provided on work-in-progress and upon completion, the cost will be transferred to the respective component of property, plant and equipment.

When significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

Property, plant and equipment are derecognised upon disposal; or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Gains or losses arising on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are determined as the difference between the disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the assets and are recognised in profit or loss.

(ii) Subsequent costs

The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Group and to the Company and their costs can be measured reliably. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

(iii) Depreciation

Depreciation is based on the cost of an asset less its estimated residual value. Significant components of individual assets are assessed, and if a component has a useful life that is different from the remainder of that asset, then that component is depreciated separately.

Depreciation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful lives of each component of an item of property, plant and equipment at the following estimated useful lives:

Buildings 10 - 50 years

Plant and machineries 5 - 20 years

Motor vehicles, furniture, fixtures and equipment 3 - 10 years

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at end of the reporting period and adjusted as appropriate.

Fully depreciated property, plant and equipment are retained in the financial statements until they are no longer in use and no further charge for depreciation is made in respect of these property, plant and equipment.

# Bearer plants

Bearer plants are living trees that are the source of supply of agricultural products and where production is expected for more than one period with a remote likelihood of being sold as other than agricultural produce. Bearer plants comprise of pre-cropping cost incurred for new plantings and replanting.

The carrying values of bearer plants are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The useful life and depreciation method are reviewed at each financial year end to ensure that the amount, method and period of depreciation are consistent with previous estimates and the expected pattern of consumption of the future benefits.

Depreciation is recognised in the profit or loss on straight line basis over its estimated useful lives of bearer plants at the following estimated useful lives:

Bearer plants - after maturity

22 years

A bearer plant is derecognised upon disposal; or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the bearer plant is included in profit or loss in the year the bearer plant is derecognised.

# 9.3 Significant accounting estimates and judgements

The Group's and the Company's management determine the estimated useful lives and related depreciation changes for the Group's and the Company's property, plant and equipment with reference to the estimated periods that the Group and the Company intend to derive future economic benefits from the use of these assets. Management performs periodic review of the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment, and will revise the depreciation charges where estimated useful lives are different than those previously estimated.

The fair value of the above investment property was estimated based on indicative valuation by an independent registered valuer dated 8 January 2025, which was based on the comparison method. The market comparison approach is a method whereby the property's fair value is estimated based on comparable transactions.

Investment property valued using the comparison method with significant adjustments made for differences such as location, size, time factor and tenure are categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy of MFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement. Changes in fair value are recognised in the statements of comprehensive income during the reporting period in which they are reviewed.

The fair value of the investment property as at 31 December 2024, remained consistent with the prior year. This is primarily due to stable market conditions in the region where the property is located.

There was no income derived from the above investment property. However, there is a quit rent expense of RM44,000 (2023: RM44,000).

# 10.1 Material accounting policy information

Investment property is property which is owned or held to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or for both, but not for sale in the ordinary course of business, use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes.

Investment property is measured initially at its cost. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the investment property. Investment property is subsequently measured at fair value with any change therein recognised in profit or loss for the period in which they arise.

An investment property is derecognised on its disposal, or when it is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected from its disposal. The difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount is recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the items in derecognised.

# (a) Acquisition of a subsidiary

On 28 February 2024, the Company entered into a Share Sale and Purchase Agreement ("SSPA") to acquire 10,000,000 ordinary shares in Merchong Palm Oil Mill Sdn. Bhd. ("MPOM") representing  $100\%$  equity interest for a purchase consideration of RM10,000,000. Subsequent on 14 June 2024, the Company announced that all the condition precedents as stated in the SSPA have been fulfilled and completed on 13 June 2024. Consequently, MPOM became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.

The fair value of identifiable assets was determined to be RM5,002,000, giving rise to a goodwill amounting to RM4,998,000. The net cash outflow of the acquisition is RM1,567,000.

The fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities arising from the purchase price allocation ("PPA") of MPOM as at the date of acquisition was as follows:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Note</td><td>Fair value RM’000</td></tr><tr><td>Net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Property, plant and equipment</td><td>9</td><td>53,527</td></tr><tr><td>Right-of-use assets</td><td>15</td><td>1,141</td></tr><tr><td>Trade and other receivables</td><td></td><td>8,869</td></tr><tr><td>Cash and bank balances</td><td></td><td>8,433</td></tr><tr><td>Inventories</td><td></td><td>3,536</td></tr><tr><td>Lease liabilities</td><td></td><td>(1,274)</td></tr><tr><td>Trade and other payables</td><td></td><td>(69,230)</td></tr><tr><td>Net identifiable assets acquired</td><td></td><td>5,002</td></tr></table>

# 11.1 Material accounting policy information

Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries as at the reporting date. The financial statements of the subsidiaries used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are prepared for the same reporting date as the Company. Consistent accounting policies are applied for like transactions and events in similar circumstances.

Subsidiaries are consolidated when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Company loses control of the subsidiary.

Losses within a subsidiary are attributed to the non-controlling interests even if that results in a deficit balance.

Changes in the Group's ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in the Group losing control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the Group's interest and the noncontrolling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. The resulting difference is recognised directly in equity.

When control ceases, the disposal proceeds and the fair value of any retained investment are compared to the Group's share of the net assets disposed. The difference together with the carrying amount of allocated goodwill and reserves that relate to the subsidiary is recognised as gain or loss on disposal.

Business combination

Acquisitions of subsidiaries are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. The Group elects on a transaction-by-transaction basis whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. Transaction cost incurred are expensed and included in profit or loss.

When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at acquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.

Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interests over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If this consideration is lower than fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised in profit or loss.

After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group's cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.

Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed in these circumstances is measured based on the relative values of the disposed operation and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.

Subsidiaries

In the Company's separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less impairment losses. On disposal of such investments, the difference between net disposal proceeds and their carrying amounts is included in profit or loss.

Non-controlling interests

Non-controlling interests represents the equity in subsidiaries not attributable directly or indirectly, to Owners of the Company, and is presented separately in the consolidated profit or loss and within equity in the consolidated financial position, separately from equity attributable to Owners of the Company.

Transactions eliminated on consolidation

Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions between subsidiaries in the Group, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted associates and joint ventures are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group's interest in the investees. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.

# 12.1 Material accounting policy information

# Associates

Associates are entities, in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.

Investments in associates are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method less any impairment losses. The cost of the investment includes transaction costs. The consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associates, after adjustments if any, to align the accounting policies with those of the Group, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.

When the Group's share of losses exceeds its interest in an associate, the carrying amount of that interest including any long-term investments is reduced to zero, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an obligation to fund the associate's operations or has made payments on behalf of the associate.

Goodwill relating to an associated company is included in the carrying amount of the investment. The goodwill is calculated as the difference between the cost of the investment and the investor's share of the net fair value of the investee's identifiable assets and liabilities.

When the Group ceases to have significant influence over an associate, any retained interest in the former associate at the date when significant influence is lost is measured at fair value and this amount is regarded as the initial carrying amount of a financial asset. The difference between the fair value of any retained interest plus proceeds from the interest disposed of and the carrying amount of the investment at the date when equity method is discontinued is recognised in profit or loss.

Associates (cont'd)

When the Group's interest in an associate decrease but does not result in a loss of significant influence, any retained interest is not re-measured. Any gain or loss arising from the decrease in interest is recognised in profit or loss. Any gains or losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income are also reclassified proportionately to profit or loss.

Dividend from associates is recognised as a reduction in the carrying amounts of associates.

The associates' financial statements shall be prepared using uniform accounting policies for the transactions and events in similar circumstances.

The Group and the Company lease various office units and lease of lands. Rental contracts for office units and warehouses are made for fixed periods of 3 to 5 years but have extension options. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions.

# 15.1 Material accounting policy information

The Group and the Company recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use assets are initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.

The right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are presented as a separate line in the statements of financial position.

The right-of-use assets are subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use assets or the end of the lease term. The estimated useful lives of the right-of-use assets are determined as follows:

Lease of land

Leasehold land

Office units and warehouses

Motor vehicles

Over the lease period ranging from 28 to 60 years

Over the lease period ranging from 46 to 98 years

Over the lease period

5 years

In addition, the right-of-use assets are periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurement of the lease liabilities. The Group and the Company apply MFRS 136 to determine whether a right-of-use asset is impaired and accounts for any identified impairment loss.

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments at the commencement date, discounted using the Group's and the Company's incremental borrowing rates. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability includes fixed payment.

The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, or if the Group and the Company change its assessment of whether it will exercise an extension or termination option.

Lease payments associated with short-term leases and leases of low value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less.

# FFB prior to harvest (unharvested FFB)

Represents the FFB of up to 15 days prior to harvest for sale or for use in the Group's and the Company's palm product operations. During the current financial year, the Group and the Company harvested 382,156 metric tonnes (MT) of FFB (2023: 292,663 MT) and 220,088 MT of FFB (2023: 165,274 MT) respectively. The quantity of unharvested FFB of the Group and of the Company as at 31 December 2024 included in the fair valuation of unharvested FFB was 9,034 MT (2023: 10,375 MT) and 5,303 MT (2023: 6,238 MT) respectively.

The Group and the Company attribute a fair value on the unharvested FFB at each statement of financial position date as required under MFRS 141 Agriculture. FFB are the produce of oil palm trees and are harvested continuously throughout the financial year. Each FFB take approximately 22 weeks from pollination to reach maximum oil content to be ready for harvesting. The value of each FFB at cash point of the FFB production cycle will vary based on the cumulative oil content in each fruit.

In determining the fair value of unharvested FFB, management uses estimates of cash flows using the expected output method and observable market price of FFB. Management has considered the oil content of all unripe FFB from the week after pollination to the week prior to harvest. As the oil content accrues exponentially in the 2 weeks prior to harvest, the FFB prior to 2 weeks before harvesting is excluded in the valuation as the fair values are considered to be negligible.

The fair value of the Group's and of the Company's unharvested FFB were within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

There were no transfers between all three levels of the fair value hierarchy during the financial year.

# Sensitivity analysis

The management are in view that the impact from the change in the Group's and the Company's fair value of FFB, if the key estimates and assumption on selling price and production volume had increased or decreased by  $10\%$  at the reporting date, is insignificant to the Group. Therefore, the sensitivity analysis is not presented.

# 17.1 Material accounting policy information

Biological assets comprised of produce growing on bearer plants. Biological assets are measured at fair value less costs to sell. Any gain or losses arising from changes in the fair value less costs to sell are recognised in profit or loss.

Biological assets are classified as current assets for produce that are expected to be harvested and sold on a date not more than 12 months after the reporting date.

# 29. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

# Categories of financial instruments

The Group's and the Company's financial assets and financial liabilities are all categorised at amortised cost except for other financial assets which are categorised as fair value through profit or loss and fair value through other comprehensive income.

# Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies

The Group's and the Company's activities are exposed to a variety of financial risks which include credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, agricultural risk and equity price risk. The Group's and the Company's overall financial risk management policy focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group's and the Company's financial performance.

Risk management is an integral to the whole business of the Group and of the Company. Management continually monitors the Group's and the Company's risk management process to ensure that an appropriate balance between risk and control is achieved. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in the market conditions and the Group's and the Company's activities.

There have been no changes to the Group's and the Company's exposure to these financial risks or the manner in which they manage and measure the risk.

# (a) Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. The Group's and the Company's exposure to credit risk arises principally from their receivables (which consist of trade and other receivables, amounts due from subsidiaries, amounts due from associates and amounts due from related parties). For other financial assets (including cash and bank balances and fixed deposits with licensed banks), the Group and the Company minimise credit risk by dealing exclusively with high credit rating counterparties. There are no significant changes as compared to prior periods.

# Trade receivables

Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk

Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. Credit risk is minimised and monitored via strictly limiting the Group's and the Company's associations to business partners with good credit rating. Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit over a certain amount.

At each reporting date, the Group and the Company assess whether any of the trade receivables are credit impaired.

There are no significant changes as compared to previous financial year.

Exposure to credit risk, credit quality and collateral

As the Group and the Company do not hold any collateral, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of the financial assets as at the end of the reporting period.

Trade receivables (cont'd)

Concentration of credit risk

The Group and the Company determine concentration of credit risk by monitoring the profiles of their receivables on an ongoing basis.

As at 31 December 2024, the Group and the Company have significant concentration of credit risk arising from the amount owing by 3 customers (2023: 2 customers) constituting  $67\%$  (2023:  $82\%$ ) and 1 customer (2023: 1 customer) constituting  $100\%$  (2023:  $100\%$ ) of gross trade receivables of the Group and of the Company respectively.

Recognition and measurement of impairment loss

The Group and the Company apply the MFRS 9 simplified approach to measure Expected Credit Losses (ECL) which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for trade receivables.

The Group and the Company assess impairment of trade receivables on individual basis.

For individual assessment, it is due to the number of debtors is minimal and these debtors can be individually managed by the Group in an effective and efficient manner. The Group has reasonable and supportable information available to assess the impairment individually. All these customers have low risk of default.

Evidence that a financial asset is credit impaired includes the observable data about the following events:

Significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;  
- A breach of contract such as a default or significant past due event.

As at reporting date, there were no indications of impairment loss in respect of the trade receivables.

# Write-off policy

The gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off (either partially or full) to the extent that there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when the Group and the Company determine that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. However, financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Group's and the Company's procedures for recovery of amounts due. Any recoveries made are recognised in profit or loss.

Receivables that are not past due nor impaired

Trade receivables that are not past due nor impaired are creditworthy debtors with good payment records and mostly are regular customers that have been transacting with the Group and the Company.

Receivables that are past due but not impaired

The Group has not provided for these trade receivables as there has been no significant changes in their credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.

Credit impaired

Trade receivables that are individually determined to be impaired at the reporting date relate to debtors that are in significant financial difficulties and have defaulted on payments which past due more than 90 days. The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.

# Other receivables and deposits

Expected credit loss of other receivables is determined individually after considering the financial strength of the other receivables. As at the end of the reporting period, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by their carrying amounts in the statements of financial position. Other receivables are neither past due nor impaired. The Group and the Company believe that generally no allowance for impairment is necessary as these debtors have good records of payment in the past.

Deposits mainly arise from deposits paid for leasehold lands of which the Group and the Company are pending for transfer of land title from the Pengarah Tanah and Galian Pahang and Pentadbir Tanah Daerah Pekan. These deposits paid for leasehold lands will be capitalised in property plant and equipment upon transfer of land titles and thus have low credit risk. As at the end of the reporting period, no allowance for impairment is necessary in respect of the deposits.

Trade

Trade receivables in respect of subsidiaries, associates and related parties represent amounts outstanding arising from sales of goods.

In arriving at loss allowance, the same assumptions as trade receivables have been applied and management is of the view that there is no indication of impairment loss in respect of amounts due from subsidiaries, associates and related parties as at the reporting date.

# Non-trade

The Group and the Company provide unsecured loans and payment on behalf to its subsidiaries, associates, and related parties. The Group and the Company monitor the ability of these subsidiaries, associates, and related parties to repay the loans and payment on behalf on an individual basis.

Exposure to credit risk, credit quality and collateral

As at the end of the reporting period, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by their carrying amounts in the statements of financial position. Loans and payment on behalf provided are not secured by any collateral or supported by any other credit enhancements.

Subsidiaries, Associates and Related Parties (cont'd)

Recognition and measurement of impairment loss

Loans and payment on behalf with subsidiaries, associates and related parties are repayable on demand. For loans that are repayable on demand, expected credit losses are assessed based on the assumption that repayment of the loan is demanded at the reporting date.

Generally, the Group and the Company consider loans and payment on behalf to subsidiaries, associates, and related parties to have low credit risk. The Group and the Company assume that there is a significant increase in credit risk when the entity's financial position deteriorates significantly. As the Group and the Company are able to determine or influence the timing of payments of the subsidiaries', associates' and related parties' loans and payment on behalf when they are payable, the Group and the Company consider the subsidiaries', associates' and related parties' loan or payment on behalf to be credit impaired when the respective entities are unlikely to repay its loan or payment on behalf to the Group and to the Company in full given insufficient highly liquid resources when the payment on behalf are demanded.

The Group and the Company determine the probability of default for these loans and payment on behalf individually using internal information available.

As at the year end, there were no indications of impairment loss in respect of these amounts.

# (b) Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group and the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting financial obligations when they fall due. The Group's and the Company's exposure to liquidity risk arises primarily from mismatches of various payables and lease liabilities.

The Group and the Company actively manage their operating cash flows and the availability of funding so as to ensure that all refinancing, repayment and funding needs are met.

The table below summarises the maturity profiles of the Group's and of the Company's financial liabilities at the reporting date based on contractual undiscounted cash flows:

# Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies (cont'd)

# (c) Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group's exposure to interest rate risk arises mainly from interest-bearing financial assets and financial liabilities.

The interest rate profile of the Group's and the Company's significant interest-bearing financial instruments, based on carrying amounts as at the end of the reporting year was:

<table><tr><td rowspan="3"></td><td colspan="2">Group and Company</td></tr><tr><td>2024</td><td>2023</td></tr><tr><td>RM’000</td><td>RM’000</td></tr><tr><td>Floating rate instruments:</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Financial liabilities</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>- Term loan</td><td>86,250</td><td>101,250</td></tr></table>

The Group and the Company are exposed to interest rate risk through the impact of rate changes in floating term loan. The interest rate of term loan is disclosed in Note 24. The changes of 100 basis points in interest rates would not have material impact on the profit or loss of the Group and the Company.

# (d) Agricultural risk on biological assets

The Group and the Company are exposed to risks arising from environmental and climatic changes, commodity prices and production volume arising mainly from the FFB. These risks may impact the Group's revenue, cash flows, and financial performance.

As disclosed in Note 17, the sensitivity analysis is not presented as the impact to the financial statements is insignificant to the Group and the Company.

# (e) Market price risk

Market price risk arises from the Group's investment in debt instruments. The management of the Group and the Company monitor the investment on an individual basis.

The management are in view that the impact from the change in the Group's fair value on other investments, if the fair value of market value had increased or decreased by  $10\%$  at the reporting date, is insignificant to the Group and the Company. Therefore, the sensitivity analysis is not presented.

# 30. FAIR VALUE INFORMATION

Assets and liabilities carried at fair value

The fair value measurement hierarchies used to measure non-financial assets at fair values in the statements of financial position are disclosed in Notes 10, 14 and 17.

There was no material transfer between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the financial year.

# Notes to the Financial Statements (Cont'd)

- 31 December 2024

# 30. FAIR VALUE INFORMATION (cont'd)

Financial instrument other than those carried at fair value

Financial instruments that are not carried at fair value and whose carrying amounts are reasonable approximation of fair values

The carrying amounts of short-term receivables and payables and cash and cash equivalents approximate their fair values due to the relatively short-term nature of these financial instruments and insignificant impact of discounting.

The carrying amount of long-term floating rate loan approximates its fair value as the loans will be re-priced to market interest rate on or near reporting date.

# 31. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

The Group's and the Company's objectives when managing capital is to maintain a strong capital base and safeguard the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Group and the Company monitor and maintain an optimal debt-to-equity ratio that complies with debt covenants and regulatory requirements.

The Group monitors capital using debt-to-equity ratio which is the debt divided by total equity. Debt includes borrowings and lease liabilities, whilst total capital is equity attributable to Owners of the Company.

The debt-to-equity ratios at end of the reporting period are as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan="3"></td><td colspan="2">Group</td><td colspan="2">Company</td></tr><tr><td>2024</td><td>2023</td><td>2024</td><td>2023</td></tr><tr><td>RM’000</td><td>RM’000</td><td>RM’000</td><td>RM’000</td></tr><tr><td>Borrowings and lease liabilities</td><td>103,606</td><td>117,513</td><td>86,423</td><td>101,540</td></tr><tr><td>Total equity attributable to the Owners of the Company</td><td>1,467,230</td><td>1,382,842</td><td>746,941</td><td>727,595</td></tr><tr><td>Debt-to-equity ratio (%)</td><td>7%</td><td>8%</td><td>12%</td><td>14%</td></tr></table>

There were no changes in the Group's and the Company's approach to capital management during the financial year.

The borrowings and lease liabilities of the Group and the Company are not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
