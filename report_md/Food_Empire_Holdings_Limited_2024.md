# Dear Shareholders

FY2024 was a good year for Food Empire. Amidst significant challenges brought on by geopolitical conflicts, trade tensions and climate change, we achieved strong growth with revenue rising  $11.9\%$  year- on- year (“yoy”) to a new record of US $476.3 million. Although our normalised net profit after tax (“NPAT”) came in \(11.4\%$  lower yoy at US\)50.0 million $^{1}$ , it is still a very good bottom- line performance and the second highest in the Group’s history on a normalised basis.

Our results are a strong testament of our Group's resilience and agility in navigating an increasingly complex business landscape and our ability to operate successfully in extreme environments.

During the year, ongoing geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe and the Middle East made global trade difficult as it resulted in severe disruptions to trade routes, which led to major logistical inconveniences and resulted in higher freight charges. We were also affected by rising operational costs caused by inflation and the increasing cost of raw materials such as coffee beans, which rose to record levels due to the effect of climate change on supply.

Despite these headwinds, we found ways to optimise our business processes and intensified our sales and marketing efforts, resulting in healthy revenue performance across all our segments.

# Enhancing Shareholder Value

In line with our good results and as a reflection of our confidence in Food Empire's business prospects, the Board of Directors has proposed a first and final dividend of 6.0 Singapore cents per ordinary share and a special dividend of 2.0 Singapore cents per ordinary share, bringing the total dividend for FY2024 to 8.0 Singapore cents per ordinary share.

This is the third consecutive year of increase in ordinary dividends, and it amplifies our strong commitment to creating and returning value to our shareholders. If the proposed dividend for FY2024 is approved by shareholders at the upcoming Annual General Meeting, the Group would have returned a total of S $155.4 million to shareholders between FY2021 and FY2024. This includes S$ 130.2 million in dividends and S$25.2 million in the form of share buybacks.

As at 31 December 2024, the Company had, pursuant to the Share Buyback Mandate approved by the Shareholders at the 2024 EGM, purchased an aggregate of 3,735,000 shares through a series of market purchases during the year.

# Securing Market Dominance

In FY2024, we continued to strengthen our leadership position, especially in Asia. Vietnam led the way as the Group's fastest-growing consumer market as our brands gain new ground in market dominance to improve our market share.

Elsewhere, in Russia, our sales continued to grow in local currency terms despite market challenges, and this was due to the strong standing of our flagship MacCoffee brand and our effective price positioning. Our Ukraine, Kazakhstan

and CIS markets segment also delivered increased revenue with higher contribution from all markets in this segment.

In our ingredients manufacturing business, both our freeze-dried and spray-dried soluble coffee manufacturing facilities in India are running at optimum capacities and delivering strong results. In Malaysia, we achieved higher sales volumes of non-dairy creamer due to the expanded capacity of our non-dairy creamer manufacturing facility while our snack business also delivered an increase in revenue due to higher sales volumes.

The above achievements were possible due to our strategic investments in capacity expansion, brand building and continued focus on South Asia and South-East Asia over the past decade that reinforced Food Empire's ability to meet growing demand and produce a good set of result.

# Strengthening Asia

Over the past decade, the international business landscape has undergone significant shift, marked by populism and nationalism. Post-election policy changes in the US have exacerbated the trend with threats of trade protectionism against many of its major trading partners. The world is facing even greater unpredictability with serious implications on national security, currency markets and global economy.

Against the backdrop of global uncertainties, the Group has continuously invested in value-enhancing strategic projects to position us for sustainable growth. This multi-year effort, which started in the early 2010s, has enabled us to effectively diversify our business risks. In the process, we have tapped into the growing affluence of Asia. Its tremendous transformational potential is becoming increasingly apparent. Today the region is home to some of the Group's fastest growing market segments.

To position ourselves for the next phase of Asia-led growth, we have commenced efforts to further strengthen our Asia presence with a slew of new investments, which should deliver quality growth in the years to come and improved earnings visibility for the Group.

In 2Q2024, we successfully completed the expansion of our non-dairy creamer manufacturing facility in Malaysia, effectively doubling our non-dairy creamer capacity. The newly added capacity is expected to ramp up to full utilisation over the next two to three years.

In FY2024, we unveiled plans to build our first coffee-mix production facility in Kazakhstan. When completed by end of 2025, it will serve our existing markets in the Central Asia region more efficiently while enabling us to explore new commercial opportunities in the region.

We also expect our snack business to be boosted with the successful expansion of our production factory in Malaysia, which is slated to commence commercial production by second quarter of 2025.

In addition, we announced a US\(80.0 million commitment to build a new freeze-dried soluble coffee manufacturing facility in Binh Dinh, Vietnam, slated for completion in early 2028. This represents a milestone for our ingredient manufacturing business and together with our existing soluble coffee

manufacturing facilities in India, position us as a major player in the soluble coffee space in Asia.

In FY2024, we also entered into a strategic partnership with Ikhlas Capital, an ASEAN private equity fund manager focused on growth, transformation and cross border value creation. Proceeds from the US$40.0 million, 5-year, 5.5% Redeemable Exchangeable Notes will be used to drive capital expenditures and merger and acquisitions in the regions. We are excited about this strategic partnership and believe that Ikhlas Capital's regional presence, knowledge and network in South-East Asia will help the Group further accelerate growth and scale in the South-East Asia and internationally.

# Improving Brand Recognition

Brand recognition has always been an important pillar of our business, and in FY2024, Food Empire continued to earn accolades for brand excellence. The Group was awarded Gold for Cover Photo/Design and Printing & Production in the Beverage & Food Manufacturer Category at the prestigious Annual Report Competition Awards. CaféPHO, our flagship coffee brand, was honoured with the 2024 Top Brand Award by Influential Brands. Additionally, Food Empire was recognised for the 14th consecutive year on Brand Finance's 2024 "Top 100 Most Valuable Singapore Brands" list, ranking 60th.

# Giving Back to Community

Beyond business performance, our commitment to corporate social responsibility runs deep throughout our organisation. In FY2024, we contributed to various causes in many of our markets.

In Singapore, we co-organised the Starry Night charity dinner with Brands for Good in support of Helping Joy, a charity that restores homes of those in need. It was a heartfelt evening of generosity and compassion.

In India, our Indus Coffee team supported the neighbouring communities by sponsoring the construction of a school, bus stop, reverse osmosis water plants and drainage canal. They also donated computers and printers to government high schools.

In Vietnam, as part of our FES Vietnam initiative, "The Journey of Sharing", employees donated funds, essential goods and medical supplies to May Ngan Orphanage, spending time with the children. They also celebrated the Mid-Autumn Festival with orphaned children, gifting mooncakes and school supplies.

We will continue to seek opportunities to expand our social efforts, ensuring more communities benefit from our support.

# Appreciation

In closing, I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to our dedicated management team and employees, whose hard work and perseverance have propelled our Group's performance. I also want to express my sincere appreciation to our Board of Directors for their guidance, as well as to our customers, partners, and stakeholders for their unwavering support. Most importantly, I thank our shareholders for your immense trust and confidence in our Group.

The Group will continue to seize opportunities, rise above challenges, and blaze a path toward greater prosperity and an even brighter future for Food Empire.

# GROUP CEO'SMESSAGE

# Dear Shareholders

Food Empire is pleased to deliver an  $11.9\%$  year- on- year ("yoy") increase in our topline to US\$476.3 million in FY2024, and our fourth successive year of record- breaking revenue. The strong performance was despite FY2024 being one of the most challenging years for the industry as inflationary pressures remained high and coffee bean prices soared to heights not seen before due to the negative impact of climate change on crops. Some of our markets were also affected by the devaluation of local currencies against the US dollar.

Against this backdrop, the Group's normalised net profit after tax ("NPAT") decreased \(11.4\%\) yoy to US\\(50.0 million in FY2024, which translated to basic earnings per share of 9.45 (normalised) US cents. Shareholders should note that although it had fallen as compared to FY2023, this is still the second highest normalised NPAT achieved since the Company's inception.

Net Profit After Tax

For the period FY2020 to FY2024, the Group's revenue and normalised NPAT had expanded at a healthy compound annual growth rate ("CAGR") of  $14.9\%$  and  $17.2\%$  respectively despite these being very difficult years for many businesses and industries all over the world with events such as a global pandemic, geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions and rising costs.

# MRSUDEEP NAIR GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICE AND EXECUTIVE

GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT AS WE WORK TOWARDS THE NEXT PHASE OF GROWTH FOR FOOD EMPIRE.

# FY2024 Market Highlights

During FY2024, our South-East Asia, South Asia and Ukraine, Kazakhstan and CIS markets segments achieved robust double-digit yoy revenue growth of  $27.3\%$ ,  $24.9\%$  and  $12.6\%$  respectively.

Our fastest and biggest growth in FY2024 came from our South-East Asia segment and Vietnam was the fastest growing market in this segment thanks to the success of targeted consumer campaigns that have deeply entrenched CaféPHO as the nation's go-to brand for instant coffee mixes since its launch in 2013. Sales from Vietnam made up more than  $50\%$  of revenue from the South-East Asia segment in FY2024 and we expect this positive trajectory to carry on as we remain committed to further strengthen our distribution network and intensify consumer engagement and other marketing and promotional activities across both modern and traditional platforms.

Malaysia also contributed higher revenue to the South-East Asia segment due to higher sales volumes of non-dairy creamer to customers in key markets, supported by the expanded production capacity and capability in our nondairy creamer factory. Our snack business also recorded higher sales volumes to key markets and new customers secured during the year. Looking ahead, we are expecting higher revenue from our snack business when the planned expansion of our snack manufacturing facility is completed by the first quarter of 2025 and commenced commercial production by the second quarter of the year.

Meanwhile our full-cycle soluble coffee manufacturing units in India that are part of Food Empire's vertical integration projects have provided our South Asia segment with amazing growth since we started our spray-dried and freeze-dried soluble coffee manufacturing facilities in 2015 and 2021 respectively. The segment's revenue expanded at a CAGR of  $70.9\%$  from FY2020 to FY2024 in tandem with the ramping up of our manufacturing facilities over the period. Both facilities are now running at nearly full capacities and we are exploring potential opportunities to further expand our production capacity.

The performance of our Ukraine, Kazakhstan and CIS markets segment remained strong in FY2024 driven mainly by our markets in Central Asia. In Kazakhstan, we had fully integrated a recently acquired subsidiary "Tea House" in May 2024, which contributed new revenue in FY2024. Tea House is one of the leading tea producers in Kazakhstan and we expect full contribution from this subsidiary in FY2025. We also continued to invest in new product development and launches in the CIS markets, which strengthened the market standing of our brands and boosted the segment's revenue during the year.

Revenue from the Russian segment grew  $7.3\%$  in local currency terms although it was a slight dip of  $1.1\%$  when translated to US dollars. This is still our biggest revenue contributor and most established segment, and we believe our leading position in this market remains secure as we continue to leverage our operational track record and strong brands.

# Ramping Up for the Next Phase

As we continue to reap the positive outcomes from the past decade's investments, we have also embarked on

new investments that will take the Group to the next phase of growth.

Although we believe there are opportunities across all segments, we expect growth in Asia to outpace other regions. As such, we will be prioritising capex by focusing our major investments on Asia while continuing to commit resources to reinforce our leadership positions in regions elsewhere. In line with this, we announced various commercial and strategic initiatives in FY2024 to tap on regional opportunities.

In May 2024, we announced a new coffee-mix production facility in Kazakhstan that is expected to be completed by the end of 2025. This will be Food Empire's first coffeemix production facility in Central Asia and it will enable the Group to serve markets in that region more efficiently. In September 2024, we committed to invest in a freeze-dried soluble coffee manufacturing facility in Vietnam, which is expected to be completed by 2028. This new facility will position Food Empire as one of Asia's leading manufacturers of freeze-dried soluble coffee.

As with our past investments, we expect to see meaningful results two to three years post-completion. During the gestation period, the Group will continuously explore other suitable opportunities that will contribute to the sustained growth and success of our business. To support our regional growth plans, we have inked a strategic partnership with Ikhlas Capital and will work with them to develop an Asia-focused strategy with the aim of value creation for all stakeholders.

# Commitment to Shareholder Returns

In view of the good results in FY2024 despite the challenging environment and historically high coffee prices, which had affected the entire industry, the Board of Directors has proposed a first and final dividend of 6.0 Singapore cents per ordinary share and a special dividend of 2.0 Singapore cents per ordinary share, bringing the total dividend for FY2024 to 8.0 Singapore cents per ordinary share.

This is the third consecutive year of increase in ordinary dividends, which reflects the Group's strong growth momentum over the past few years and our commitment to return value to shareholders. If the proposed first and final and special dividend for FY2024 is approved by shareholders at the upcoming annual general meeting, it would bring the total dividend between FY2021 and FY2024 to S$130.2 million.

# Appreciation

In closing, I want to thank all shareholders for being part of the Food Empire growth story and for your trust in the Group's ability to generate healthy returns on your investment. My deep appreciation to my fellow Directors on the Board for your wise counsel in strategic matters and your contributions to ensure that the Group upholds high standards in corporate governance.

Lastly, my heartfelt thanks to the management team and staff of Food Empire for your hard work and dedication that has enabled the Group to achieve growth and success even in extremely difficult years, and to all our business partners for working closely with us to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes. I look forward to your continued support as we work towards the next phase of growth for Food Empire.

# OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL REVIEW

# FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

The Group has achieved the fourth consecutive year of topline growth with revenue reaching a new record of US\(476.3 million for the financial year ended 31 December 2024 ("FY2024").

This is a \(11.9\%\) year- on- year increase from the previous high of US\(425.7 million achieved in 2023 (“FY2023”).

The stellar topline performance was a result of Food Empire's diversification strategy as well as its increasing focus on the fast-growing Asia region. Additionally, the Group's investments in brand building, distribution channels and product development have enabled its branded consumer products to continue to enjoy leadership position across all key markets.

In FY2024, the Group's revenue was boosted mainly by strong double-digit growth from its South-East Asia (up 27.3% to US $129.4 million), South Asia (up 24.9% to US$ 61.4 million) and Ukraine, Kazakhstan and CIS (up 12.6% to US$124.7 million) segments, and partially offset by a slight dip from its Russia segment (down 1.1% to US$141.7 million) due to the depreciation of the Russian Ruble against the US dollar. For the purpose of comparing underlying performance, Russia had achieved a 7.3% increase in revenue in local currency terms.

Excluding the fair value gain on redeemable exchangeable notes<sup>1</sup> of US$2.8 million, Food Empire's normalised net profit after tax declined 11.4% to US$50.0 million in FY2024, reflecting the impact of record high coffee prices during the year, and also higher overall expenses. Sales and

marketing expenses were up  $14.2\%$  due to an increase in consumer engagement activities, particularly from the Group's Vietnam market, while general and administrative expenses were up  $15.6\%$  mainly due to higher legal and professional expenses in relation to the issuance of the redeemable exchangeable notes<sup>1</sup>.

# FINANCIAL POSITION

The Group's trade receivables increased by US $11.3 million from US$ 38.2 million as at 31 December 2023 to US$49.5 million as at 31 December 2024 mainly due to higher sales.

The Group's financial position remained healthy generating an operating cash inflow of US $25.5 million in FY2024 bringing its cash and cash equivalents to US$ 130.9 million as at 31 December 2024.

The Group's net assets as at 31 December 2024 was US\(296.1 million. The net asset value per ordinary share (excluding non-controlling interests) as at 31 December 2024 was 55.84 US cents as compared to 56.20 US cents as at 31 December 2023.

# SUSTAINABILITY

# REPORT SUMMARY

This section provides a broad overview of Food Empire's progress and development in sustainability-related matters for FY2024. The scope of reporting is the Company's operations in Singapore, Vietnam, and Russia. Although Malaysia and India are outside our reporting coverage, we report on renewable energy initiatives, including solar projects, and highlight community contributions from these entities. Our report is prepared in accordance with the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited's ("SGX-ST") Listing Manual and with reference to the Global Reporting Initiatives ("GRI") Standards 2021. The Sustainability Report contains information for the financial year ended 31 December 2024 and will be published as a standalone report in 2025. The Sustainability Report 2024 should be read together with the Annual Report for a holistic picture of our business and performance.

We acknowledge the importance of effectively managing the impacts of our operations to maintain our focus on sustainability practices across our three core areas: Principles, Planet, and People. These pillars continue to serve as a guiding framework for our decision-making processes, ensuring alignment with our sustainability commitments.

Through a comprehensive reassessment of material topics, we have strengthened our material disclosures in the Sustainability Report 2024. This update features expanded reporting on waste management, employment, and training and education initiatives.

Last year, we completed solar panel installations at two factories in Malaysia, which began operations in August 2023. In FY2024, these installations generated 6,892 MWh of energy. Additionally, we reported 24 MWh from our Vietnam factory and 1,436 MWh of solar energy from our India factory in FY2024.

We remain committed to CSR initiatives that focus on community support, sustainability, and education. We have organised charity events to support the less privileged, launched environmental initiatives like battery disposal awareness, and supported orphanages and children's causes. We have also contributed to local development, such as constructing

water plants and improving infrastructure, while enhancing educational access through donations of computers and school supplies. Through these efforts, we continue to show our dedication to making a positive impact on both people and the environment. Further details are available in our Sustainability Report 2024.

In strengthening our Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ("TCFD") practices, we have integrated key recommendations into our 2024 Sustainability Report. With climate change's growing impact, we embed environmental considerations into decision-making and manage climate risks across our value chain, focusing on Scope 1 and 2 emissions. This year, we introduced scenario analysis to assess financial impacts under various climate pathways, enhancing risk understanding and alignment with global climate goals. We will continue refining key metrics for transparent and forward-looking reporting.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

Food Empire Holdings Limited (the "Company") together with its subsidiaries (the "Group") are committed to maintaining good corporate governance to enhance and protect the interests of the Company's shareholders. The Company recognises the importance of practicing good corporate governance and supports the Code of Corporate Governance 2018 (the "Code"). The Company has complied in all material respects with the principles and guidelines in the Code. Where there are deviations from the Code, appropriate explanations will be provided.

This report outlines the corporate governance framework and practices adopted by the Company with reference given to the principles of the Code.

# A) BOARD MATTERS

- Principle 1: Effective Board to lead and control the Company

The principal functions of the Board are:

1) supervising the Management of the business and affairs of the Group;  
2) approving Board policies, overall strategic plans, key operational initiatives, financial and human resources objectives of the Group;  
3) reviewing and monitoring the performance and rewarding of key management;  
4) overseeing the processes for evaluating the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls, risk management, financial reporting and compliance;  
5) approving the nomination of the Board of Directors and appointment of key management personnel;  
6) approving annual budgets, major funding, investment and divestment proposals; and  
7) assuming responsibility for corporate governance.

The Board also plays an important role in setting the Company's values and standards, establishing framework of prudent and effective controls, engaging with stakeholder groups and overseeing the sustainability issues of the Group.

Each member of the Board has a fiduciary duty to discharge his or her duties and responsibilities in the best interest of the Company at all times and to take into account the interests of key stakeholder groups in their decision-making.

To facilitate effective management, the Board has delegated certain functions to various Board Committees. The Board Committees operate under clearly defined terms of reference. The Chairman of the respective committees will report to the Board the outcomes of the committee meetings.

There are three Board Committees:

Audit Committee ("AC")  
- Remuneration Committee ("RC")  
Nominating Committee ("NC")

The Board approves transactions exceeding certain threshold limits set by the Board, while delegating authority for transactions below those limits to Board Committees and the Management via a structured Delegation of Authority matrix. This matrix is reviewed on a regular basis. The Board Committees and the Management remain accountable to the Board. Matters which specifically require the Board's approval involve conflicts of interests of a substantial shareholder or a Director, material acquisitions and disposal of assets, corporate or financial restructuring, share issuances, dividends and other returns to shareholders. The Directors and the Group's employees are also guided by The Food Empire Business Ethics and Code of Conduct and Employee Handbook, which prescribe the standards of ethical behaviour. Any director facing conflicts of interests will recuse himself or herself from discussions and decisions involving the issues of conflict.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

# A) BOARD MATTERS (cont'd)

- Principle 1: Effective Board to lead and control the Company (cont'd)

The Board conducts scheduled meetings on a quarterly basis. Ad-hoc meetings are convened as and when circumstances require. Telephonic or videoconferences via audio-visual communication at Board meetings are allowed under the Company's Constitution.

The Non-Executive Directors ("NED") and Independent NEDs ("INED") always constructively challenge and help develop proposals on strategy and review Management's performance in meeting agreed goals and objectives, and monitor the reporting of Management's performance. Where necessary, NEDs and/or INEDs led by the Lead Independent Director ("Lead ID") may meet among themselves without the presence of Management outside of Board meetings.

The Board met 8 times in 2024 (including Annual General Meeting and Extraordinary General Meeting) and the attendance of the Directors at meetings of the Board and Board Committees, and general meetings for the financial year ended 31 December 2024 ("FY2024") as well as the frequency of these meetings, are disclosed as follows:

<table><tr><td>Directors</td><td>Board Meeting</td><td>AC Meeting</td><td>NC Meeting</td><td>RC Meeting</td><td>Annual General Meeting</td><td>Extraordinary General Meeting</td></tr><tr><td>Tan Wang Cheow</td><td>6</td><td>N/A</td><td>1</td><td>N/A</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Sudeep Nair</td><td>5</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Tan Guek Ming</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>N/A</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Koh Yew Hiap</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>N/A</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Ong Kian Min</td><td>6</td><td>N/A</td><td>1</td><td>N/A</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Saw Meng Tee</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Tan Cher Liang</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Adrian Chan Pengee</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>No. of Meetings Held in 2024</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr></table>

The Directors are appointed based on the strength of their skills and experience and potential to contribute to the Company. The current Board comprises business leaders and professionals. Profiles of the Directors can be found under the 'Board of Directors' section of this annual report.

All new directors appointed to the Board, if any, will be provided with a formal letter of appointment. The Company has an orientation programme for new directors, and the newly appointed directors are briefed on matters relating to the Group's business activities, its strategic directions and policies, the regulatory environment in which the Group operates and the Company's corporate governance practices.

The Company will also arrange for first-time directors, if any, to undergo training on their roles and responsibilities as directors of a listed company organised by the Singapore Institute of Directors for an understanding of their legal and fiduciary obligations as individuals and of the Board as a whole. Briefings by the Executive Chairman, Group Chief Executive Officer ("Group CEO"), Group Chief Financial Officer ("Group CFO") and all the department heads will be done to familiarise the new directors with the Company's business and operations.

The Management monitors changes to regulations and accounting standards. The Directors are briefed on the new updates to the requirements of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited ("SGX-ST"), the Companies Act 1967 (the "Act") or other regulations/statutory requirements from time to time by external professionals, such as the auditors, Company Secretary, or at seminars. If required, all Directors will receive further training. The Company is responsible for arranging and funding the training of Directors. As at the date of this report, all Directors have attended the mandatory training on sustainability matters organised by SID, as prescribed under Rule 720(7) of the SGX-ST Listing Manual.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

# A) BOARD MATTERS (cont'd)

- Principle 1: Effective Board to lead and control the Company (cont'd)

The Company has adopted a policy whereby Directors are welcome to request further explanations, briefings or informal discussions on any aspect of the Group's operations or business issues from Management. The NEDs and INEDs are briefed and updated on major developments and the progress of the Group at the Board meetings.

# - Provision 1.6: Board members to have complete, adequate and timely information

In order to ensure that the Board is able to fulfil its responsibilities, Management provides the Board members with complete, adequate and timely information. The Management also provides quarterly updates on the latest developments in the Group, financial and management accounts, operational metrics, audit findings, risk dashboard and reports, and other financial information.

The Board is provided with board papers and related materials with explanatory information such as facts, resources needed, risk analysis and strategies, financial impact, expected outcomes and recommendations to facilitate discussion and decision-making before the Board and Board Committees' meetings. Any material variance between any projections and the actual results of budgets is disclosed and explained to the Board. Employees who can provide additional insight into matters to be discussed will be present at the relevant time during the meetings.

The Directors have been provided with the contact particulars of the Company's senior management staff and the Company Secretary to facilitate access. The Directors also have separate and independent access to any external advisers (if necessary) at the Company's expense.

The Company Secretary (or representative(s)) will attend Board and Board Committees' meetings as required by the Board. They are responsible for ensuring that Board procedures are followed and that the Company has complied with the requirements of the Act and the SGX-ST Listing Manual. The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary are subject to the Board's approval.

The Directors are informed and are aware that they may take independent professional advice at the Company's expense, where necessary, in furtherance of their duties.

# B) BOARD COMPOSITION AND GUIDANCE

- Principle 2: Independent and diversity elements of the Board

As at the date of this report, the Board comprises eight Directors, three of whom are independent. The Board composition is as follows:

Mr Tan Wang Cheow Executive Chairman

Mr Sudeep Nair Group CEO and Executive Director ("ED")

Mdm Tan Guek Ming NED

Mr Koh Yew Hiap NED

Mr Ong Kian Min NED

Mr Saw Meng Tee Lead ID

Mr Tan Cher Liang INED

Mr Adrian Chan Pengee INED

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

# B) BOARD COMPOSITION AND GUIDANCE (cont'd)

- Principle 2: Independent and diversity elements of the Board (cont'd)

The core competencies of the Board members are as follows:

<table><tr><td>Directors</td><td>Accounting/Finance/Business/ManagementExperience</td><td>IndustryKnowledge</td><td>Strategic Planning</td><td>Law</td></tr><tr><td>Tan Wang Cheow</td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Sudeep Nair</td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Tan Guek Ming</td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Koh Yew Hiap</td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Ong Kian Min</td><td>✓</td><td></td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td></tr><tr><td>Saw Meng Tee</td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Tan Cher Liang</td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Adrian Chan Pengee</td><td>✓</td><td></td><td>✓</td><td>✓</td></tr></table>

The Directors are professionals in their own fields with industrial, financial and legal backgrounds. Together they provide the Group with a wealth of knowledge, expertise and experience to ensure the Group remains competitive and competent. The INEDs contribute their independent views and objective judgements on issues of strategy, business performance, resources and standards of conduct.

The independence of each INED is assessed at least annually by the NC.

The Company has a Board Diversity Policy in place, which sets out the approach to achieve diversity in the Company's Board. The Company recognises and embraces the importance and benefits of having a diverse Board to enhance the quality of its performance. It is accordingly committed to promoting diversity of the Board. The Board comprises one female Director and Directors with various skills, knowledge and experience, age groups, ethnicity and culture, geographical background and tenure. The Board, with the concurrence of the NC, is also of the view that the composition of the Board and the Board Committees, as a group, provides an appropriate balance and diversity of skills, experience, ethnicity, gender, age and knowledge of the Group. No individual or group dominates the decision-making process of the Board and Board Committees.

The Board is of the view that it has made good progress in achieving its objectives under the Board Diversity Policy of the Company. As part of the Board renewal process, the NC will review these objectives from time to time and may recommend changes or may recommend additional objectives to achieve greater diversity.

The NC is of the view that the current Board and Board Committees have the necessary competencies, skills and attributes to meet the Group's targets and to respond to the demands facing the Group.

The NC is also of the view that the current Board size of eight Directors is appropriate, taking into account the nature and scope of the Company's operations. The Company has a majority of NEDs on its Board. The Board is of the view that a Director's independence cannot be determined arbitrarily with reference to set period of service. However, the NC recognises that the Board renewal process is of utmost importance. Having regard to the experience and leadership of the founder Chairman, Mr Tan Wang Cheow, it is in the best interest of the Company to maintain his executive chairmanship in the Company so that the Board could have the benefit of a Chairman who is knowledgeable about the business of the Group, which he founded and is capable to guide and watch over the best interests of the Company. The Company has been searching for suitable candidates for appointment as new INED to ensure that there is a majority of INEDs on the Board where the founder Chairman, Mr Tan, is not an Independent Director ("ID") as required by Provision 2.2 of the Code. The NC will continue to monitor the progress of the Board renewal, also taking into account the commitment, experience and invaluable advice each Director offers when deciding on the Board renewal in the interest of a smooth transition, and the Company will announce the reconstitution of its Board membership to SGX-ST at the appropriate time.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

# C) CHAIRMAN AND GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

- Principle 3: Clear division of responsibilities at the top of the Company

The roles of the Executive Chairman and Group CEO are separate to ensure a clear division of responsibilities, balance of power, increased accountability and greater capacity of the Board for independent decision-making. The Executive Chairman and the Group CEO do not have any familial relationship with each other.

The Executive Chairman, Mr Tan Wang Cheow, is the founder of the Company and he is primarily responsible for overseeing the Group's strategies, which include developing new markets and exploring opportunities for acquisitions.

The Group CEO, Mr Sudeep Nair, is responsible for the Group's diversification and growth strategy, including overall oversight of the day-to-day operations. His roles include geographical expansion of the business as well as identifying new businesses and merger and acquisition opportunities for the Group. Mr Nair has over 31 years of experience in building and managing the Group's business.

In addition, the Executive Chairman has responsibility for the workings of the Board and ensuring the integrity and effectiveness of its governance processes. The Executive Chairman is also responsible for representing the Board to shareholders, ensuring that Board meetings are held when necessary, setting the Board meeting agendas and ensuring that the Board members are provided with adequate and timely information. He promotes high standards of corporate governance and an open environment for debate and ensures that NEDs are able to speak freely and contribute effectively. Regular meetings are scheduled to enable the Board to perform its duties and agendas are prepared in consultation with Management as well as the Company Secretary. At the AGM and other shareholders' meetings, the Executive Chairman plays a pivotal role in fostering constructive dialogue between shareholders, key stakeholder groups, the Board and Management.

The Lead ID, Mr Saw Meng Tee, shall be available to shareholders where they have concerns and for which contact through the normal channels of the Executive Chairman or Management is inappropriate or inadequate. He shall also represent the INEDs in responding to shareholders' questions and comments that are directed to the INEDs as a group at any general meetings of the Company.

The Lead ID may call for meetings of the INEDs as and when necessary and provide feedback to the Executive Chairman after such meetings.

In carrying out their duties, the Executive Chairman, Group CEO and Lead ID are also guided by the Company's Terms of Reference of the Executive Chairman, Group CEO and Lead ID.

The Board has in place a succession planning policy for key management personnel. The NC also reviews succession and development plans for key management personnel, which will be subsequently approved by the Board.

The NC has reviewed the multiple board seats held by the Directors to determine if they have been adequately carrying out their duties as Directors of the Company. Though some of the Directors have multiple board representations, the NC is satisfied that the Directors have devoted sufficient time and attention to the Company. The Board determined that it is not necessary to set a maximum number of listed board representations that any Director may hold, as all the Directors are able to devote time to the Company's affairs despite their other commitments.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

# D) BOARD MEMBERSHIP (cont'd)

- Principle 4: Formal and transparent process of appointment of new Directors (cont'd)

The Board renewal is an ongoing process and the NC is responsible for identifying and recommending new Board members, after considering the necessary and desirable competencies. In its search and selection process for new directors, the NC considers the attributes including the diversity of skills (such as legal background), knowledge and experience (including experience in manufacturing and food business) on the Board. Other considerations include, but are not limited to background, gender, age, and ethnicity. The short-listed candidates would be required to furnish their curricula vitae stating in detail their qualification, working experience, employment history, in addition to completing certain prescribed forms to enable the NC to assess the candidate's independence status and compliance with the Company's established internal guidelines. Thereafter, the NC will interview the candidates and make its recommendation to the Board for approval. In accordance with the Company's Constitution, the new director will hold office until the next AGM and, if eligible, can stand for re-election.

The NC may tap into its networking contacts and/or engage external search consultants to undertake research on, or to assess a candidate for new positions on the Board. The NC can engage other independent experts if necessary, to help it carry out its duties and responsibilities. Recommendations for new Board members are put to the Board for its consideration.

The Company does not have any alternate director on its Board.

# E) BOARD PERFORMANCE

- Principle 5: Formal assessment of the effectiveness of the Board, Board Committees and contributions of each Director

The NC has formulated an evaluation process for assessing the effectiveness of the Board and Board Committees and the contributions of each Director. The assessment parameters include:

a) attendance at Board and Board Committees' meetings;  
b) participation in meetings and special contributions, including Management's access to the Director for guidance or the exchange of views outside the formal environment of Board meetings;  
c) introducing contacts of strategic benefit to the Group; and  
d) progress of implementation of the board diversity policy.

The Board's evaluation process is performed annually, whereby questionnaires were sent by the external company secretarial agent to the Directors, and the results of the evaluation were tabled to the NC for deliberation. The results of the performance evaluation showed that the overall performance of the Board, Board Committees and contribution of the individual Directors were in the categories of "consistently good". The Chairman of the NC reported the results of the evaluation and recommended areas for improvement to the Board Chairman. The NC and the Board were satisfied with the overall performance in FY2024.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

# F) REMUNERATION MATTERS

- Principle 6: Formal and transparent procedure for fixing remuneration packages of Directors and key management personnel  
- Principle 7: Remuneration of Directors and key management personnel should be appropriate but not excessive  
- Principle 8: Remuneration policy, level and mix of remuneration and procedure for setting remuneration

The RC comprises:

Mr Adrian Chan Pengee (Chairman)

Mdm Tan Guek Ming

Mr Koh Yew Hiap

Mr Tan Cher Liang

Mr Saw Meng Tee

All five members of the RC are NEDs. The RC has a majority of INEDs, including the RC Chairman.

The RC's main responsibility is to review and recommend a framework for the remuneration of the Board members and key executives of the Group that is appropriate and proportionate to the sustained performance and value creation. The objective is to motivate and retain executives, link rewards to corporate and individual performance, attract the best talent in order to maximise shareholder value and align with the interest of other key stakeholders of the Company.

The remuneration of the EDs is based on service agreements signed upon their appointments. The service agreements will continue unless otherwise terminated by either party giving not less than three months' notice in writing.

# F) REMUNERATION MATTERS (cont'd)

- Principle 6: Formal and transparent procedure for fixing remuneration packages of Directors and key management personnel (cont'd)  
- Principle 7: Remuneration of Directors and key management personnel should be appropriate but not excessive (cont'd)  
- Principle 8: Remuneration policy, level and mix of remuneration and procedure for setting remuneration (cont'd)

Although the Code recommends the disclosure of amounts and breakdown of remuneration of each individual Director, Group CEO and top five key management personnel on a named basis, the Board has decided not to adopt this practice for the top five key management personnel because it is of the view that such disclosure may be detrimental to the Group's interest as it may lead to poaching of executives within a highly competitive industry and may compromise the personal safety of the individuals concerned as they travel to or work within some emerging markets. It also wishes to maintain confidentiality of remuneration within the Group for more harmonious and effective human resource management and deployment of executives across the many countries in which the Group operates.

The aggregate total remuneration paid to the top five key management personnel (who are not the Directors or the Group CEO) was S\(4,672,673 in FY2024.

The Company has implemented the clawback provision for its key office holders. The clawback will be triggered by events such as material violation of risk limits, misstatement of financial results, misconduct or fraud.

In FY2024, the RC did not engage external consultant to advise the RC on any remuneration matters.

The breakdown of the remuneration of the Directors for FY2024 is set out in the table below:

There are no employees who are substantial shareholders of the Company or immediate family members of a Director or the Executive Chairman or the Group CEO or a substantial shareholder whose remuneration exceeds S$100,000 during FY2024.

# G) ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT

- Principle 9: Sound systems of risk management and internal controls

The Board is accountable to the shareholders while the Management of the Group is accountable to the Board. The Board is committed to providing timely information to the shareholders and the public with a balanced, clear and understandable assessment of the Group's financial updates, position and prospects on a quarterly basis.

The Company believes that presenting a balanced view of its performance, position and prospects is imperative to maintaining shareholders' confidence and trust.

The Management provides quarterly management reports to the Board members and also presents to the Board the Group's quarterly and full year accounts and the AC reports on the results for review and approval. In compliance with the SGX-ST's requirement for half yearly reporting, the Board approves the half year and full results and authorises the release of the results to SGX-ST and the public via SGXNet.

The Board also reviews legislation and regulatory compliance reports from the Management to ensure that the Group complies with relevant statutory reporting requirements.

The Board is also responsible for the governance of risk and sets the tone and direction for the Group in the way risks are managed in the Group's businesses. The Board has ultimate responsibility for approving the strategy of the Group in a manner which addresses key stakeholders' expectations and does not expose the Group to an unacceptable level of risk.

The Board approves the key risk management policies, ensures a sound system of risk management and internal controls, and monitors performance against them. In addition to determining the approach to risk governance, the Board sets and instills the right risk-focused culture throughout the Group for effective risk governance.

The Board has approved a Group Risk Management Framework for the identification of key risks within the business which is aligned with the ISO 31000:2018 Risk Management framework. To enhance the effectiveness of the enterprise risk management ("ERM") framework, the Group implemented the Orion ERM system, a third-party software that automates the risk management, internal control and assurance functions, and enables these functions to be managed on an integrated platform.

Management presented an annual assurance report to the AC and the Board on the Group's risk profile, the risk mitigation action plans and the results of various assurance activities carried out on the adequacy of Group's internal controls including financial, operational, compliance and IT controls, and risk management systems. Such assurance activities include control self-assessments performed by Management, internal and external audits, and external certifications conducted by various external professional service firms.

The Board has obtained a written confirmation from the Executive Chairman, Group CEO and Group CFO that:

1) the financial records have been properly maintained and the financial statements give a true and fair view of the Group's operations and finances; and  
2) the Group maintains effective and adequate risk management and internal control systems.

The Executive Chairman, Group CEO and Group CFO have obtained assurances from the respective risk and control owners.

Based on the risk management framework and internal controls established and maintained by the Group, works performed by the internal and external auditors, external certification firms, and annual reviews performed by Management, various Board Committees and the Board, the Board (with the concurrence of the AC) is satisfied that the Group's risk management and internal control systems addressing financial, operational, compliance and IT risks, were adequate and effective as at 31 December 2024.

The Board and the AC are also responsible for (a) monitoring the Company's risk of becoming subject to, or violating, any Sanction Law; and (b) ensuring timely and accurate disclosures to SGX-ST and other relevant authorities.

The Company will continue to monitor all markets and update shareholders on any material impact of such risk on the financials and operations of the Group, if any, and also the cessation of sanctions-related risk via announcement to SGXNet.

The Board notes that the system of internal controls and risk management established by the Company provides reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the Company will not be adversely affected by any event that can be reasonably foreseen as it strives to achieve its business objectives. However, the Board also notes that no system of internal controls and risk management can provide absolute assurance against the occurrence of material errors, poor judgement in decision-making, human error, losses, fraud or other irregularities.

# Credit Risk of Customers

In the normal course of its business, the Group extends credit terms to its customers, primarily to those located in developing countries.

Under its credit policy, credit evaluations are performed for new customers and ongoing evaluations are also performed for existing customers. Other key mitigating controls include established credit limits, regular reviews and follow up on trade receivables ageing.

The Group maintains an internal control system which includes human resource measures, policies, procedures and information systems to mitigate this risk.

The Group has implemented remuneration packages aimed at retaining existing personnel and conducts regular performance reviews to reward key management personnel who contribute to the success of the Group.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

For the financial year ended 31 December 2024

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF FOOD EMPIRE HOLDINGS LIMITED

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Food Empire Holdings Limited (the "Company") and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Group"), which comprise the balance sheets of the Group and the Company as at 31 December 2024, the statements of changes in equity of the Group and the Company and the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income and consolidated cash flow statement of the Group for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including material accounting policy information.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Group, the balance sheet and the statement of changes in equity of the Company are properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1967 (the "Act") and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (SFRS(I)) so as to give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group and the financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2024 and of the consolidated financial performance, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group and changes in equity of the Company for the year ended on that date.

# Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing (SSAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities (ACRA Code) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Singapore, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ACRA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

# Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

We have fulfilled our responsibilities described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying financial statements.

# 1. Revenue recognition

We refer to Note 2.20 (Material accounting policy information), Note 3.2c (Significant accounting estimates and judgements) and Note 4 (Note on Revenue).

Revenue is measured taking into account of discounts and rebates earned by customers on the Group's sales, which give rise to variable consideration under SFRS(I) 15. Variable consideration is estimated and is recognised as revenue to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in revenue recognised up-to-date will not occur when the discount and rebate amounts are subsequently finalised. In addition, due to the multitude and variety of contractual terms across the Group's operating markets, the estimation of variable consideration arising from discounts and rebates is considered to be complex and judgemental. As such, we considered this to be a key audit matter.

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (cont'd)

Key audit matters (cont'd)

# 1. Revenue recognition (cont'd)

As part of our audit procedures, we evaluated the appropriateness of the Group's revenue recognition accounting policies. We obtained an understanding of the revenue recognition process, performed a walkthrough of the significant class of transactions and evaluated the design of the relevant internal controls for effectiveness. We also tested the effectiveness of the management's internal controls over the timing of the revenue recognition and gross or net presentation of revenue. In addition, we read significant sales contracts and revenue arrangements, and performed inquiries of management to understand the potential impact of the various terms on revenue recognition, and to also determine if the arrangement is appropriately identified as a contract in accordance with SFRS(I) 15.

In respect of discounts and rebates and the relating variable consideration recognised during the year, we checked to the terms of agreements and other supporting documents. We assessed the appropriateness of the method used and the reasonableness of data and assumptions used such as historical experience and purchasing patterns in the estimation of variable consideration and determination of the amount of revenue to be recognised. We also assessed the adequacy of disclosures in Note 2.20.

# 2. Recoverability of trade receivables

We refer to Note 2.13 (Material accounting policy information), Note 3.2b (Significant accounting estimates and judgements) and Note 23 (Note on Trade Receivables).

Trade receivable balances of US$49,536,000 are significant to the Group as they represented 16.7% of the Group's net assets as at 31 December 2024. The collectability of trade receivables is a key element of the Group's working capital management, which is managed on an ongoing basis by management. The Group determines expected credit losses for trade receivables by making debtor-specific assessment for credit-impaired debtors and using provision matrix method for the remaining group of debtors. In determining the estimated credit loss allowance for the Group's trade receivables as at year end, management had considered various factors such as the age of the outstanding balances, historical payment and credit loss patterns over an appropriate period, facts and circumstances specific to the countries and economic environments where the Group operates, correlation between economic conditions and historical credit losses, as well as the forecast of future macro-economic conditions over the expected life of the Group's trade receivables, which require significant management judgement. This estimation is further affected by the economic uncertainty brought on by the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Accordingly, we determined that this is a key audit matter.

As part of our audit procedures, we assessed the Group's processes and key controls relating to the monitoring of trade receivables, including the process in determining whether a debtor is credit-impaired. We also considered ageing of the receivables to identify collection risks. We evaluated management's assumptions and inputs used in the computation of historical credit loss rates and reviewed data and information that management had used to make forward-looking adjustments, including consideration on impact arising from the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. We requested trade receivable confirmations and reviewed for collectability by way of obtaining evidence of subsequent receipts from the trade receivables. We held discussions with management on their assessment of the recoverability of long outstanding receivables in particular receivables that could be affected by the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, analysed trend of collections and assessed management's assumptions used to determine expected credit losses for such trade receivables notably through consideration of their specific profiles and risks.

We assessed the adequacy of the Group's disclosures on the trade receivables and the related credit risk in Note 38a.

# 3. Impairment assessment of intangible assets

We refer to Note 2.12 (Material accounting policy information), Note 3.2a (Significant accounting estimates and judgements) and Note 16 (Note on Intangible Assets).

As at 31 December 2024, intangible assets comprise goodwill of US$5,396,000 and brand of US$4,789,000, representing 1.8% and 1.6% of the Group's net assets respectively. The Group annually carries out an impairment assessment using a value-in-use model which is based on discounted cash flows of the cash generating units ("CGU"). Management estimated the recoverable value using assumptions in respect of future market and economic conditions to estimate expected revenue and margin, inflation rate, discount rates and economic growth. As disclosed in Note 16, the Group's goodwill is allocated to each of the Group's CGU or group of CGUs. As intangible assets impairment assessment requires management to apply significant judgement in determining the key assumptions, especially in the current economic uncertainty, we determined this a key audit matter.

As part of our audit procedures, we assessed the reasonableness of the key assumptions applied by the Group in determining the recoverable amounts of each CGU. In particular, we tested the underlying assumptions by comparing to historical results for reasonableness, with considerations of the impact on growth forecasts due to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. We involved our internal specialist to assess the reasonableness of discount rates and long-term growth rates used by the Group by checking the discount rate to comparable companies and comparing the long-term growth rate to external economic data. We also considered the risk of potential management bias by using our own set of assumptions in developing a range of possible values to evaluate management's point estimates; and performed sensitivity analysis on reasonably possible reduction in the assumed growth rates.

We also considered the adequacy of the note disclosures concerning those key assumptions to which the outcome of the impairment test is most sensitive.

# Other information

Management is responsible for other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but does not include the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of management and directors for the financial statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the provisions of the Act and SFRS(I), and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

For the financial year ended 31 December 2024

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF FOOD EMPIRE HOLDINGS LIMITED (cont'd)

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (cont'd)

Responsibilities of management and directors for the financial statements (cont'd)

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The directors' responsibilities include overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.

# Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.  
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.  
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.  
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.  
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.  
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

For the financial year ended 31 December 2024

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF FOOD EMPIRE HOLDINGS LIMITED (cont'd)

Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements (cont'd)

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

In our opinion, the accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the Company and by those subsidiary corporations incorporated in Singapore of which we are the auditors have been properly kept in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor's report is Lim Tze Yuen.

The Company's functional currency is Singapore Dollars ("S$" or "SGD") while the financial statements are presented in United States Dollars ("US$" or "USD").

# 2.3 Standards issued but not yet effective (cont'd)

SFRS(I) 18: Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements

SFRS(I) 18 is a new standard that replaces SFRS(I) 1-1 Presentation of Financial Statements. SFRS(I) 18 introduces new requirements for presentation within the statement of profit or loss, including specified totals and subtotals. Furthermore, entities are required to classify all income and expenses within the statement of profit or loss into one of five categories: operating, investing, financing, income taxes and discontinued operations, whereof the first three are new.

It also requires disclosure of newly defined management-defined performance measures, subtotals of income and expenses, and includes new requirements for aggregation and disaggregation of financial information based on the identified 'roles' of the primary financial statements (PFS) and the notes.

In addition, narrow-scope amendments have been made to SFRS(I) 1-7 Statement of Cash Flows, which include changing the starting point for determining cash flows from operations under the indirect method, from 'profit or loss' to 'operating profit or loss' and removing the optionality around classification of cash flows from dividends and interest. In addition, there are consequential amendments to several other standards.

SFRS(I) 18, and the amendments to the other standards, is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027, but earlier application is permitted and must be disclosed. SFRS(I) 18 will apply retrospectively.

The amendments will have impact on the disclosure in the financial statements but not on the measurement or recognition of any items in the Group's financial statements.

# 2.4 Basis of consolidation and business combination

# (a) Basis of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries as at 31 December 2024. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Specifically, the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has:

- Power over the investee (i.e., existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee)  
- Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee  
- The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns

Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights results in control. To support this presumption and when the Group has less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:

- The contractual arrangements with the other vote holders of the investee  
- Rights arising from other contractual arrangements  
- The Group's voting rights and potential voting rights

The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date the Group gains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For the financial year ended 31 December 2024

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (cont'd)

# 2.4 Basis of consolidation and business combination (cont'd)

# (a) Basis of consolidation (cont'd)

Profit or loss and each component of OCI are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies in line with the Group's accounting policies. All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.

A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction.

If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the related assets (including goodwill), liabilities, non-controlling interest and other components of equity, while any resultant gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any investment retained is recognised at fair value.

# (b) Business combinations and goodwill

Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are recognised as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are received.

Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability, will be recognised in profit or loss.

Non-controlling interest in the acquiree (if any), that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of net assets in the event of liquidation, are recognised on the acquisition date at fair value, or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets.

Any excess of the sum of the fair value of the consideration transferred in the business combination, the amount of non-controlling interest in the acquiree (if any), and the fair value of the Group's previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any), over the net fair value of the acquiree's identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. In instances where the latter amount exceeds the former, the excess is recognised as gain on bargain purchase in profit or loss on the acquisition date.

Goodwill is initially measured at cost. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to the Group's cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.

The cash-generating units to which goodwill have been allocated is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the cash-generating unit may be impaired. Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit (or group of cash-generating units) to which the goodwill relates.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For the financial year ended 31 December 2024

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (cont'd)

# 2.5 Transactions with non-controlling interest

Non-controlling interest represents the equity in subsidiaries not attributable, directly or indirectly, to owners of the Company.

Changes in the Company's ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. In such circumstances, the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to owners of the Company.

# 2.6 Foreign currency

The financial statements are presented in United States Dollars. Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.

# (a) Transactions and balances

Transactions in foreign currencies are measured in the respective functional currencies of the Company and its subsidiaries and are recorded on initial recognition in the functional currencies at exchange rates approximating those ruling at the transaction dates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the end of the reporting period. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was measured.

Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at the end of the reporting period are recognised in profit or loss. Exchange differences arising on monetary items that form part of the Group's net investment in foreign operations are recognised initially in other comprehensive income and accumulated under foreign currency translation reserve in equity. The foreign currency translation reserve is reclassified from equity to profit or loss of the Group on disposal of the foreign operation.

# (b) Consolidated financial statements

For consolidation purpose, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into USD at the rate of exchange ruling at the end of the reporting period and their profit or loss are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transactions. The exchange differences arising on the translation are recognised in other comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign operation, the component of other comprehensive income relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in profit or loss.

# 2.7 Investment in subsidiaries

A subsidiary is an investee that is controlled by the Group. The Group controls an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.

In the Company's balance sheet, investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less impairment losses.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For the financial year ended 31 December 2024

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (cont'd)

# 2.8 Investment in associates and joint ventures

An associate is an entity over which the Group has the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but does not have control or joint control of those policies.

A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.

The considerations made in determining significant influence or joint control are similar to those necessary to determine control over subsidiaries. The Group's investment in its associate and joint venture are accounted for using the equity method.

Under the equity method, the investment in an associate or a joint venture is initially recognised at cost. The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Group's share of net assets of the associate or joint venture since the acquisition date. Goodwill relating to the associate or joint venture is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is not tested for impairment separately.

The statement of profit or loss reflects the Group's share of the results of operations of the associate or joint venture. Any change in OCI of those investees is presented as part of the Group's OCI. In addition, when there has been a change recognised directly in the equity of the associate or joint venture, the Group recognises its share of any changes, when applicable, in the statement of changes in equity. Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate or joint venture are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate or joint venture.

The aggregate of the Group's share of profit or loss of an associate and a joint venture is shown on the face of the statement of profit or loss outside operating profit and represents profit or loss after tax and non-controlling interests in the subsidiaries of the associate or joint venture.

The financial statements of the associate or joint venture are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. When necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group.

After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an impairment loss on its investment in its associate or joint venture. At each reporting date, the Group determines whether there is objective evidence that the investment in the associate or joint venture is impaired. If there is such evidence, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate or joint venture and its carrying value, and then recognises the loss in profit or loss.

Upon loss of significant influence over the associate or joint control over the joint venture, the Group measures and recognises any retained investment at its fair value. Any difference between the carrying amount of the associate or joint venture upon loss of significant influence or joint control and the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in profit or loss.

# 2.9 Property, plant and equipment

All items of property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Subsequent to recognition, property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.

Freehold land has an unlimited useful life and therefore is not depreciated.

Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

<table><tr><td>Freehold properties</td><td>-</td><td>10-50 years</td></tr><tr><td>Leasehold properties</td><td>-</td><td>Over the remaining term of lease between 1-60 years</td></tr><tr><td>Plant and machinery</td><td>-</td><td>5-15 years</td></tr><tr><td>Furniture and fittings and other equipment</td><td>-</td><td>3-15 years</td></tr><tr><td>Factory and office equipment</td><td>-</td><td>5-10 years</td></tr><tr><td>Computers</td><td>-</td><td>3-5 years</td></tr><tr><td>Motor vehicles</td><td>-</td><td>3-5 years</td></tr><tr><td>Forklifts</td><td>-</td><td>10 years</td></tr><tr><td>Leasehold improvements</td><td>-</td><td>5-10 years</td></tr></table>

Capital work-in-progress included in property, plant and equipment are not depreciated as these assets are not yet available for use.

The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

The residual value, useful life and depreciation method are reviewed at each financial year end, and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use. Any gain or loss on derecognition of the asset is included in profit or loss in the year the asset is derecognised.

# 2.10 Intangible assets

Intangible assets acquired separately are measured initially at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial acquisition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Internally generated intangible assets, excluding capitalised development costs, are not capitalised and expenditure is reflected in the profit or loss in the year in which the expenditure is incurred.

The useful lives of the intangible assets are assessed as indefinite.

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives or not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if the events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired either individually or at the cash-generating unit level. Such intangible assets are not amortised. The useful life of an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is reviewed annually to determine whether the useful life assessment continues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.

Brands

The brand, Petrovskaya Sloboda was acquired in a business combination in 2007. The useful life of the brand is estimated to be indefinite because based on the current market share of the brand, management believes there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the brand is expected to generate net cash inflows for the Group.

The brands under Tea House LLP were acquired upon the gain in control of Tea House LLP in 2024. The useful life of the brand is estimated to be indefinite because based on the current market share of the brand, management believes there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the brand is expected to generate net cash inflows for the Group.

# 2.11 Financial instruments

# (a) Financial assets

# Initial recognition and measurement

Financial assets are recognised when, and only when, the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument. At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset.

Trade receivables are measured at the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third party, if the trade receivables do not contain a significant financing component at initial recognition.

# Subsequent measurement

Investments in debt instruments

Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group's business model for managing the asset and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the asset. The Group has debt instruments which are held at amortised cost.

Amortised cost

Financial assets that are held for the collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. Financial assets are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the assets are derecognised or impaired, and through the amortisation process.

# Derecognition

A financial asset is derecognised where the contractual right to receive cash flows from the asset has expired. On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in profit or loss.

# 2.11 Financial instruments

# (b) Financial liabilities

# Initial recognition and measurement

Financial liabilities are recognised when, and only when, the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument. The Group determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition.

All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value plus in the case of financial liabilities not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.

# Subsequent measurement

After initial recognition, financial liabilities that are not carried at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised, and through the amortisation process.

Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss

The Group has redeemable exchangeable notes recognised at fair value through profit or loss. The fair value of the redeemable exchangeable notes is determined at the end of each reporting period.

# Derecognition

A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. On derecognition, the difference in the respective carrying amounts and the consideration paid is recognised in profit or loss.

# 2.12 Impairment of non-financial assets

The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when an annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset's recoverable amount.

An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's or cash-generating unit's fair value less costs of disposal and its value-in-use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or group of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.

Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.

A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increase cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised previously. Such reversal is recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For the financial year ended 31 December 2024

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (cont'd)

# 2.13 Impairment of financial assets

The Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss and financial guarantee contracts. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms.

ECLs are recognised in two stages. For credit exposures for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the next 12-months (a 12-month ECL). For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognised for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of timing of the default (a lifetime ECL).

For trade receivables and contract assets, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment.

The Group considers a financial asset in default when contractual payments are 90 days past due. However, in certain cases, the Group may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal or external information indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group. A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows.

# 2.14 Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and cash with banks or financial institutions, including fixed deposits that are readily convertible to known amount of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. These also include bank overdrafts that form an integral part of the Group's cash management.

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (cont'd)

# 2.15 Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition are accounted for as follows:

- Raw materials: costs of direct materials and goods purchased for resale are stated on a weighted average basis.  
Finished goods and work-in-progress: costs of direct materials and labour and a proportion of manufacturing overheads based on normal operating capacity. These costs are assigned on a weighted average basis.

Where necessary, allowance is provided for damaged, obsolete and slow moving items to adjust the carrying value of inventories to the lower of cost and net realisable value.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

# 2.16 Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.

Provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. If it is no longer probable that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation, the provision is reversed. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.

# 2.17 Financial guarantee

A financial guarantee contract is a contract that requires the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument.

Financial guarantees are recognised initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. Subsequent to initial recognition, financial guarantees are measured at the higher of the amount of expected credit loss determined in accordance with the policy set out in Note 2.13 and the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, the cumulative amount of income recognised over the period of the guarantee.

# 2.18 Borrowing costs

Borrowing costs are capitalised as part of the cost of a qualifying asset if they are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of that asset. Capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when the activities to prepare the asset for its intended use or sale are in progress and the expenditures and borrowing costs are incurred. Borrowing costs are capitalised until the assets are substantially completed for their intended use or sale. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.

# 2.19 Leases

The Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

# As lessee

The Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises lease liabilities representing the obligations to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying leased assets.

# Right-of-use assets

The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e. the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:

Leasehold land 33-60 years

Office and factory premises - 2-3 years

Motor vehicles 2-3 years

If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Group at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset.

The right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment. The accounting policy for impairment is disclosed in Note 2.12. The Group's right-of-use assets are presented within Note 13.

# Lease liabilities

At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including insubstance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses (unless they are incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.

In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments (e.g. changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments) or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset.

The Group's lease liabilities are disclosed in Note 13.

As lessee (cont'd)

Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets

The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases (i.e. those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases that are considered to be low value. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

# 2.20 Revenue

Revenue is measured based on the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties.

Revenue is recognised when the Group satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to the customer, which is when the customer obtains control of the good or service. A performance obligation may be satisfied at a point in time or over time. The amount of revenue recognised is the amount allocated to the satisfied performance obligation.

# (a) Sale of goods

Revenue is recognised when the goods are delivered to the customer and all criteria for acceptance have been satisfied. The goods are often sold with a right of return and with retrospective volume rebates based on the aggregate sales over a period of time.

The amount of revenue recognised is based on the estimated transaction price, which comprises the contractual price, net of discounts and rebates. Based on the Group's experience with similar types of contracts, variable consideration is typically constrained and is included in the transaction only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.

At the end of each reporting date, the Group updates its assessment of the estimated transaction price, including its assessment of whether an estimate of variable consideration is constrained. The corresponding amounts are adjusted against revenue in the period in which the transaction price changes.

# (b) Others

Other revenue is recognised when the Group satisfies its performance obligation upon the rendering of services.

# 2.21 Employee benefits

# (a) Defined contribution plans

The Group participates in the national pension schemes as defined by the laws of the countries in which it has operations. In particular, the Singapore companies in the Group make contributions to the Central Provident Fund scheme in Singapore, a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised as an expense in the period in which the related service is performed.

# (b) Employee leave entitlement

Employee entitlements to annual leave are recognised as a liability when they are accrued to the employees. The estimated liability for leave is recognised for services rendered by employees up to the end of the reporting period.

# (c) Employee equity compensation benefits

Employee share option plans

Employees (including senior executives and Directors) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share options as consideration for services rendered ('equity-settled share based payment transactions').

The cost of these equity-settled share based payment transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the options at the date on which the options are granted which takes into account market condition and non-vesting conditions. This cost is recognised in profit or loss, with a corresponding increase in the share-based payment reserve, over the vesting period. The cumulative expense recognised at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group's best estimate of the number of options that will ultimately vest. The charge or credit to profit or loss for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period and is recognised in employee benefits expense. The employee share option reserve is transferred to accumulated profits upon expiry of the share option.

Where the employee share option plan is cancelled, it is treated as if it vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense that otherwise would have been recognised for services received over the remaining vesting period is recognised immediately. This includes any award where non-vesting conditions within the control of either the entity or the employee are not met. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph. All cancellations of equity-settled transaction awards are treated equally.

# 2.22 Taxes

# (a) Current income tax

Current income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period, in the countries where the Group operates and generates taxable income.

Current income taxes are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that the tax relates to items recognised outside profit or loss, either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.

# (b) Deferred tax

Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the end of the reporting period between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences, except:

- where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and  
- in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except:

- where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and  
- in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at end of each reporting period and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

# 2.22 Taxes (cont'd)

# (b) Deferred tax (cont'd)

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of each reporting period.

Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss. Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity and deferred tax arising from a business combination is adjusted against goodwill on acquisition.

# (c) Sales tax

Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax except:

- where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable; and  
receivables and payables that are stated with the amount of sales tax included.

# 2.23 Segment reporting

For management purposes, the Group is organised into operating segments based on their geographical locations which are independently managed by the respective segment managers responsible for the performance of the respective segments under their charge. The segment managers report directly to the management of the Company who regularly reviews the segment results in order to allocate resources to the segments and to assess the segment performance. Additional disclosures on each of these segments are shown in Note 34, including the factors used to identify the reportable segments and the measurement basis of segment information.

# 2.24 Share capital and share issuance expenses

Proceeds from issuance of ordinary shares are recognised as share capital in equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of ordinary shares are deducted against share capital.

# 2.25 Treasury shares

The Group's own equity instruments, which are reacquired ( treasury shares) are recognised at costs and deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group's own equity instruments. Any difference between the carrying amount of treasury shares and the consideration received, if reissued, is recognised directly in equity. Voting rights related to treasury shares are nullified for the Group and no dividends are allocated to them respectively.

# 2.26 Contingencies

A contingent liability is:

(a) a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group; or  
(b) a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because:

(i) it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; or  
(ii) the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.

A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group.

Contingent liabilities and assets are not recognised on the balance sheet of the Group, except for contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination that are present obligations and which the fair values can be reliably determined.

# 3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS

The preparation of the Group's consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the end of each reporting period. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that could require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in the future periods.

# 3.1 Judgements made in applying accounting policies

Management is of the opinion that there is no significant judgement made in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies.

# 3.2 Key sources of estimation uncertainty

The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period are discussed below. The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.

# (a) Impairment of intangible assets

As disclosed in Note 16 to the financial statements, the recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units which goodwill and brands have been allocated to are determined based on value-in-use calculations. The value-in-use calculations are based on a discounted cash flow model. The recoverable amount is most sensitive to the discount rates used for the discounted cash flow model as well as the expected future cash inflows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes. The key assumptions applied in the determination of the value-in-use are disclosed and further explained in Note 16 to the financial statements. The carrying amount of the intangible assets as at 31 December 2024 is US$10,185,000 (2023: US$8,800,000).

# (b) Allowance for expected credit losses of trade receivables

The Group uses a provision matrix to calculate ECLs for trade receivables. The provision rates are based on days past due for groupings of various customer segments that have similar loss patterns.

The provision matrix is initially based on the Group's historical observed default rates. The Group will calibrate the matrix to adjust historical credit loss experience with forward-looking information. At every reporting date, historical default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.

The assessment of the correlation between historical observed default rates, forecast economic conditions and ECLs is a significant estimate. The amount of ECLs is sensitive to changes in circumstances as well as forecasted economic conditions. The Group's historical credit loss experience and forecast of economic conditions may also not be representative of customer's actual default in the future. The information about the ECLs on the Group's trade receivables is disclosed in Note 23.

The carrying amount of trade receivables as at 31 December 2024 is US $49,536,000 (2023: US$ 38,161,000).

# (c) Variable consideration arising from discounts and rebates

Revenue is measured taking into account of discounts and rebates earned by customers on the Group's sales, which give rise to variable consideration under SFRS(I) 15. Variable consideration is estimated and is constrained to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the associated uncertainty is subsequently resolved.

The Group provides rebates to some of its customers if the customers reach a certain threshold of purchase. The Group applied the "most likely amount method" to estimate the variable consideration to which it will be entitled.

For the financial year ended 31 December 2024, the Group recognised revenue amounting to US$476,347,000 (2023: US$425,715,000).

# (d) Income taxes

Certain subsidiaries are operating in countries where the practical application of tax legislation is subject to varying interpretations. There is a risk that these subsidiaries could be exposed to further tax liabilities on their income, value added taxes/sales taxes and other taxes for current and prior financial years, if the tax authorities adopt a different interpretation of the tax legislation at the time of finalisation of these tax returns.

# (e) Uncertainty arising from on-going conflict between Russia and Ukraine

As at the date of the financial statements, the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine is still ongoing. As the situation remains volatile and may evolve, the Group is closely monitoring the financial impact to its Russia and Ukraine operations. Based on the information available and the Group's current financial position and resources, the Group has assessed that the use of the going concern assumption remains reasonable.

# 11. EARNINGS PER SHARE

# (a) Basic earnings per share

Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit for the year, net of tax, attributable to ordinary equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year.

The following table reflects the profit and share data used in the computation of basic earnings per share for the years ended 31 December:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">Group</td></tr><tr><td>2024 US$&#x27;000</td><td>2023 US$&#x27;000</td></tr><tr><td>Net profit for the year used in computing basic earnings per share</td><td>52,528</td><td>56,508</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan="2">No. of shares &#x27;000</td></tr><tr><td>Weighted average number of ordinary shares used in basic earnings per share computation*</td><td>526,140</td><td>525,581</td></tr></table>

* The weighted average number of shares takes into account the weighted average effect of changes in treasury shares transactions during the year.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For the financial year ended 31 December 2024

# 11. EARNINGS PER SHARE (cont'd)

# (b) Diluted earnings per share

Diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit for the year, net of tax, attributable to original equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.

The following table reflects the profit and shares data used in the computation of dilutive earnings per share for the years ended 31 December:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">Group</td></tr><tr><td>2024 US$&#x27;000</td><td>2023 US$&#x27;000</td></tr><tr><td>Net profit for the year used in computing diluted earnings per share</td><td>52,528</td><td>56,508</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan="2">No. of shares &#x27;000</td></tr><tr><td>Weighted average number of shares issued,

  used in diluted earnings per share computation*</td><td>529,097</td><td>533,485</td></tr></table>

* The weighted average number of shares takes into account the weighted average effect of changes in treasury shares transactions during the year.

In 2024, 4,165,000 share options granted to employees under the existing employee share option plans had not been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive. There were none in 2023.

Since the end of the financial year, senior executives have exercised the options to acquire 505,000 (2023: 6,085,000) ordinary shares. There were no significant transactions involving ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares since the reporting date and before the completion of these financial statements.

Impairment testing of goodwill and brands

Goodwill and brands acquired through business combinations have been allocated to the Group's cash-generating units ("CGUs") or group of CGUs for impairment testing.

The carrying amounts of goodwill and brands allocated to each of the Group's CGUs or group of CGUs are as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan="3"></td><td colspan="2">Group</td></tr><tr><td>2024</td><td>2023</td></tr><tr><td>US$&#x27;000</td><td>US$&#x27;000</td></tr><tr><td>Goodwill</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>- Procurement business for the Group&#x27;s Russia operating segment</td><td>3,509</td><td>4,797</td></tr><tr><td>- Manufacturing and trading businesses in Malaysia</td><td>1,887</td><td>1,887</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>5,396</td><td>6,684</td></tr><tr><td>Brands</td><td>4,789</td><td>2,116</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>10,185</td><td>8,800</td></tr></table>

During the financial year ended 31 December 2024, the Group recognised US\(2,555,000 of brands on its consolidated balance sheet as part of its gain in control of Tea House LLP (Note 14).

The recoverable amounts of the Group's CGUs or group of CGUs have been determined based on value-in-use calculations using cash flow projections from financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year period. The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections and the forecasted growth rate used to extrapolate cash flow projections beyond the five-year period are as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan="3"></td><td colspan="4">Goodwill</td><td colspan="2">Brands</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Procurement business for the Group&#x27;s Russia operating segment</td><td colspan="2">Manufacturing and trading businesses in Malaysia</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2024</td><td>2023</td><td>2024</td><td>2023</td><td>2024</td><td>2023</td></tr><tr><td>Terminal growth rates</td><td>1.00%</td><td>1.00%</td><td>1.00%</td><td>1.00%</td><td>1.00%</td><td>1.00%</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-tax discount rates</td><td>19.87%</td><td>30.05%</td><td>17.51%</td><td>23.27%</td><td>25.85%</td><td>36.01%</td></tr></table>

# 16. INTANGIBLE ASSETS (cont'd)

Key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations

The calculations of value-in-use for the Group's CGUs or group of CGUs are most sensitive to the following assumptions:

Forecasted sales growth - For the first five years of forecasted sales growth, sales are based on actual values achieved in the years preceding the start of the budget period. These are adjusted over the budget period of the next five years. An average sales growth of  $3\%$  (2023:  $5\%$ ) and  $4\%$  (2023:  $4\%$ ) per annum were applied for brands and goodwill respectively for the next five years.

Royalty rate - Royalty rates are based on the median royalty rates of an average of comparable royalty rates extracted from a published database provider.

Terminal growth rates – The forecasted growth rates beyond the five years period are based on published industry research and do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the mature industry that the Group's CGU or group of CGUs are in.

Pre-tax discount rates – Discount rates represent the current market assessment of the risks specific to each CGU or group of CGUs, regarding the time value of money and individual risks of the underlying assets which have not been incorporated in the cash flow estimates. The discount rate calculation is based on the specific circumstances of the Group and its operating segments and derived from its weighted average cost of capital ("WACC"). The WACC takes into account both debt and equity. The cost of equity is derived from the expected return on investment by the Group's investors. The cost of debt is based on the interest-bearing borrowings the Group is obliged to service. Segment-specific risk is incorporated by applying individual beta factors. The beta factors are evaluated annually based on publicly available market data.

# Sensitivity to changes in assumptions

With regard to the assessment of value-in-use for the Group's CGUs or group of CGUs, management believes that no reasonably possible change in all of the above key assumptions would cause the recoverable amounts of the units to materially fall below its carrying amount.

# Impairment loss

During the year, the Group recognised a write-back of impairment loss of US $523,000 (2023: US$ 498,000) on its Petrovskaya Sloboda brand due to improvement in the performance of the brand.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For the financial year ended 31 December 2024

# 17. DEFERRED TAX

Deferred tax as at 31 December relates to the following:

<table><tr><td rowspan="3"></td><td colspan="2">Group</td></tr><tr><td>2024</td><td>2023</td></tr><tr><td>US$’000</td><td>US$’000</td></tr><tr><td>Deferred tax assets/(liabilities):</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Provisions</td><td>1,995</td><td>1,850</td></tr><tr><td>Unutilised tax losses</td><td>1,456</td><td>480</td></tr><tr><td>Excess of net book value over tax written down value</td><td>(9,035)</td><td>(7,974)</td></tr><tr><td>Unrealised profits on inventories</td><td>2,002</td><td>2,001</td></tr><tr><td>Others</td><td>(287)</td><td>(191)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>(3,869)</td><td>(3,834)</td></tr><tr><td>Presented as:</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Deferred tax assets</td><td>3,893</td><td>3,861</td></tr><tr><td>Deferred tax liabilities</td><td>(7,762)</td><td>(7,695)</td></tr></table>

Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set-off current tax assets against current tax liabilities, and when deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to the same taxation authority.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that realisation of the related tax benefits through future taxable profits are probable.

Unrecognised tax losses

At the end of the reporting period, the Group has tax losses of approximately US$1,908,000 (2023: US$2,535,000) that are available for offset against future taxable profits of the companies in which the losses arose, for which no deferred tax asset is recognised due to uncertainty of its recoverability. The use of these unutilised tax losses is subject to the agreement of the tax authorities and compliance with certain provisions of the tax legislation of the respective countries in which the subsidiaries operate. The tax losses have no expiry date except for amounts of US$1,828,000 (2023: US$2,449,000) which have expiry periods ranging from 1 to 10 years from the date that the losses were incurred.

Unrecognised temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries

At the end of the reporting period, no deferred tax liability (2023: US$Nil) has been recognised for taxes that would be payable on the undistributed earnings of certain of the Group's subsidiaries as the Group has determined that undistributed earnings of its subsidiaries will not be distributed in the foreseeable future.

Such temporary differences for which no deferred tax liability has been recognised amounted to US $101,036,000 (2023: US$ 83,681,000).

Tax consequences of proposed dividends

There are no income tax consequences (2023: US$Nil) attached to the dividends to the shareholders proposed by the Company but not recognised as a liability in the financial statements (Note 10).

The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.

The Food Empire Holdings Limited Performance Share Plan ("2022 Award Plan") was approved and adopted at the Company's Extraordinary General Meeting held on 22 April 2022.

The 2022 Award Plan applies to eligible employees and Directors of the Group, other than the Group Non-Executive Directors (including independent Directors). Controlling Shareholders and their Associates are not eligible to participate in the 2022 Award Plan.

The participants of the 2022 Award Plan will receive shares provided that certain prescribed performance targets or vesting conditions are met within a prescribed performance period. The performance period for the awards granted is three years. The number of shares that will vest for each participant will be determined at the end of the performance period based on the level of attainment of the performance targets.

The 2022 Award Plan is administered by the RC.

# 34. SEGMENT INFORMATION

For management purposes, the Group is organised into five reportable segments based on geographical locations. The five main segments are:

(i) Russia  
(ii) South-East Asia  
(iii) Ukraine, Kazakhstan and CIS markets  
(iv) South Asia  
(v) Others

In presenting information on the basis of geographical segments, the segment revenue and results for sale of ingredients are based on the physical location of the factories.

For all other sales, the segment revenue and results are based on the geographical locations of the customers. This is consistent with the manner which the Group's chief operating decision makers review the segment results of the Group.

The Group regularly reviews each reportable segment results for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit or loss which in certain respects, as explained in the table below, is measured differently from the operating profit or loss in the consolidated financial statements.

Transfer pricing between operating parties, are on arm's length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.

# 37. FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

# (a) Fair value hierarchy

The Group categorises fair value measurement using a fair value hierarchy that is dependent on the valuation input used as follows:

(i) Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group can access at the measurement date;  
(ii) Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and  
(iii) Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

Fair value measurements that use inputs at different hierarchy levels are categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement.

There have been no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 fair value measurements during the financial years ended 2024 and 2023.

# (b) Liabilities measured at fair value

The following table shows an analysis of financial liabilities measured at fair value at the end of the reporting period:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td rowspan="2">Date of valuation</td><td rowspan="2">Note</td><td>Fair value measurements using Significant observable inputs (Level 2)</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>US$&#x27;000</td><td>US$&#x27;000</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5">2024</td></tr><tr><td colspan="5">Liability measured at fair value:</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>31 December 2024</td><td>30</td><td>37,170</td><td>37,170</td></tr><tr><td>Redeemable exchangeable notes</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>

Determination of fair value

The fair value of redeemable exchangeable notes is determined using Binomial Tree model as of the date of valuation. Management has also assessed the credit spread of the Group and determined that there is no significant change in the liability's credit risk from inception date to valuation date. As a result, the cumulative change in the fair value of the redeemable exchangeable notes that is attributable to changes in credit risk of the liability is determined to be Nil.

# (c) Fair value of financial instruments by classes that are not carried at fair value and whose carrying amounts are reasonable approximation of fair value

The carrying amounts of trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, amounts due from subsidiaries (non-trade), current amounts due from associates and joint venture (non-trade), amounts due from related parties (trade), trade and other payables, current lease liabilities, current interest-bearing loans and borrowings, amounts due to subsidiaries (non-trade), amount due to a related party (non-trade), current amount due to a minority shareholder (non-trade) and amounts due to associates and joint venture (trade and non-trade) are reasonable approximation of fair values due to their short-term nature.

# 37. FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES (cont'd)

# (c) Fair value of financial instruments by classes that are not carried at fair value and whose carrying amounts are reasonable approximation of fair value (cont'd)

The carrying amounts of non-current lease liabilities, interest-bearing loans and borrowings and amount due to a minority shareholder (non-trade) are reasonable approximation of fair values as their interest rate approximate the market lending rate.

The carrying amount of non-current amount due from joint venture reasonably approximates fair value as the effect of discounting these cash flows based on the expected receipt dates is not significant.

# 38. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES

The Group and the Company are exposed to financial risks arising from its operations and the use of financial instruments. The key financial risks include credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies and procedures for the management of these risks.

The Group and the Company does not apply hedge accounting.

The following sections provide details regarding the Group's and the Company's exposure to the above-mentioned financial risks and the objectives, policies and processes for the management of these risks.

# (a) Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of loss that may arise on outstanding financial instruments should a counterparty default on its obligations. The Group's and the Company's exposure to credit risk arises primarily from trade and other receivables. For other financial assets (including cash and cash equivalents), the Group and the Company minimise credit risk by dealing with high credit rating counterparties.

The Group's objective is to seek continual revenue growth while minimising losses incurred due to increased credit risk exposure. The Group trades only with recognised and creditworthy third parties. It is the Group's policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group's exposure to bad debts is not significant.

The Group sells mainly to Russia, South-East Asia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and CIS markets. Hence, risk is concentrated on the trade receivables in these countries.

The Group considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of asset and whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis throughout each reporting period.

The Group has determined the default event on a financial asset to be when the counterparty fails to make contractual payments, within 90 days when they fall due, which are derived based on the Group's historical information.

The Group considers "low risk" to be an investment grade credit rating with at least one major rating agency for those investments with credit rating. To assess whether there is a significant increase in credit risk, the Company compares the risk of a default occurring on the asset as at reporting date with the risk of default as at the date of initial recognition. The Group considers available reasonable and supportive forward-looking information which includes the following indicators:

- Internal credit rating  
External credit rating  
Actual or expected significant adverse changes in business, financial or economic conditions that are expected to cause a significant change to the borrower's ability to meet its obligations  
- Actual or expected significant changes in the operating results of the borrower  
Significant increases in credit risk on other financial instruments of the same borrower  
Significant changes in the value of the collateral supporting the obligation or in the quality of third-party guarantees or credit enhancements  
Significant changes in the expected performance and behaviour of the borrower, including changes in the payment status of borrowers in the Group and changes in the operating results of the borrower.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For the financial year ended 31 December 2024

# 38. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (cont'd)

# (a) Credit risk (cont'd)

Regardless of the analysis above, a significant increase in credit risk is presumed if a debtor is more than 30 days past due in making contractual payment.

The Group determined that its financial assets are credit-impaired when:

- There is significant difficulty of the issuer or the borrower  
- A breach of contract, such as a default or past due event  
- It is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation  
There is a disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulty.

The Group categorises a loan or receivable for potential write-off when a debtor fails to make contractual payments more than 150 days past due. Financial assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, such as a debtor failing to engage in a repayment plan with the Group. Where loans and receivables have been written off, the Group continues to engage enforcement activity to attempt to recover the receivable due. Where recoveries are made, these are recognised in profit or loss.

The following are credit risk management practices and quantitative and qualitative information about amounts arising from expected credit losses for each class of financial assets.

# Trade receivables

The Group provides for lifetime expected credit losses for all trade receivables, and contract assets using a provision matrix. The provision rates are determined based on the Group's historical observed default rates analysed in accordance to days past due by grouping of customers based on geographical region. The loss allowance provision as at 31 December 2024 and 2023 incorporates forward-looking information such as forecast of economic conditions where the gross domestic product may change significantly over the next year.

# Credit risk concentration profile

The Group determines concentrations of credit risk by monitoring the country and industry sector profile of its trade receivables on an ongoing basis. The credit risk concentration profile of the Group's trade receivables at the end of the reporting period is as follows:

Group  

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td>2024</td><td>2023</td></tr><tr><td>US$&#x27;000</td><td>US$&#x27;000</td></tr><tr><td>Russia</td><td>12,937</td><td>7,848</td></tr><tr><td>South-East Asia</td><td>15,893</td><td>13,165</td></tr><tr><td>Ukraine, Kazakhstan and CIS markets</td><td>13,750</td><td>11,126</td></tr><tr><td>South Asia</td><td>6,635</td><td>5,737</td></tr><tr><td>Others</td><td>321</td><td>285</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>49,536</td><td>38,161</td></tr></table>

# Financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired

Trade and other receivables that are neither past due nor impaired are creditworthy debtors with good payment record with the Group. Cash and cash equivalents that are neither past due nor impaired are placed with or entered into with reputable financial institutions or companies with high credit ratings and no history of default.

# Financial assets that are either past due or impaired

Information regarding financial assets that are either past due or impaired is disclosed in Notes 20, 23 and 24.

# (b) Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group or the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting financial obligations due to shortage of funds. The Group's and the Company's exposure to liquidity risk arises primarily from mismatches of the maturities of financial assets and liabilities.

At the end of reporting period, approximately  $71\%$  (2023:  $41\%$ ) of the Group's loans and borrowings will mature in less than one year based on the carrying amount reflected in the financial statements.

The Group monitors its liquidity risk and maintains a level of cash and cash equivalents deemed adequate by Management to finance the Group's operation and to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in cash flows.

# 38. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (cont'd)

# (c) Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of the Group's and the Company's financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group's exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from interest-bearing loans and borrowings with floating interest rates. The Group monitors the interest rate on loans and borrowings closely to ensure that the loans and borrowings are maintained at favourable rates. At the end of the reporting period, the Group manages its interest risk by having a balanced portfolio of fixed and variable rate loans and borrowings.

Sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk

The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the Group's profit net of tax to a reasonably possible change in interest rate, with all other variables held constant.

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">Group</td></tr><tr><td>Increase/ decrease in basis points</td><td>Effect on profit, net of tax US$&#x27;000</td></tr><tr><td>2024</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents</td><td>+10</td><td>131</td></tr><tr><td>Interest-bearing loans and borrowings</td><td>+100</td><td>(289)</td></tr><tr><td>2023</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents</td><td>+10</td><td>131</td></tr><tr><td>Interest-bearing loans and borrowings</td><td>+100</td><td>(262)</td></tr></table>

# (d) Foreign currency risk

The Group has transactional currency exposures arising from sales, purchases or operating costs by operating units in currencies other than the unit's functional currency.

The Management ensures that the net exposure is maintained at an acceptable level by buying and selling foreign currencies at spot rates where necessary to address short-term fluctuations.

Sensitivity analysis for foreign currency risk

The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the Group's profit before tax to a reasonably possible change in the Euro, Malaysia Ringgit (RM), Ukrainian Hryvnia (UAH), Russian Ruble (RUB), Indian Rupee (INR), Singapore Dollar (SGD) and Kazakhstan Tenge (KZT) against the respective functional currencies of the Group entities, with all variables held constant.
