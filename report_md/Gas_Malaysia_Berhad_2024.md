Gas Malaysia Berhad ("Gas Malaysia") was incorporated on 16 May 1992. Gas Malaysia, together with its subsidiaries and joint ventures (collectively referred to as "the Group"), primarily focuses on the selling, marketing, and distributing natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers as well as developing, operating, and maintaining the Natural Gas Distribution System ("NGDS") within Peninsular Malaysia. With the total market liberalisation of the gas industry for the non-power sector initiated in 2022 under the Third-Party Access framework, the competitive landscape of the gas supply industry saw enhancement. We further strengthened our position in the industry value chain to prepare ourselves for full market liberalisation by successfully unbundling our business operations into two (2) separate entities.

These two (2) entities, Gas Malaysia Distribution Sdn Bhd ("GMD") and Gas Malaysia Energy and Services Sdn Bhd ("GMES"), are wholly owned by Gas Malaysia and were awarded a distribution licence and shipping licence, respectively, from the regulator. GMD was granted a 20-year distribution licence, which allows it to develop, operate, and maintain the NGDS in Peninsular Malaysia, ensuring the safe and reliable delivery of gas to customers. GMES, meanwhile, was granted a 10-year shipping and importation licences, and operates as a gas shipper. The licences enable GMES to procure gas from gas suppliers and arrange gas delivery in accordance with customer requirements.

Serving as a key driver for the Group's sustainable growth, we supply natural gas to 1,077 industrial customers. In an effort to broaden our reach, we extend our services by supplying natural gas as well as Liquefied Petroleum Gas to 2,010 commercial customers and 22,032 residential customers.

The Group also has strategic presence in several niche operations, notably in the simultaneous generation and sale of electricity and steam, as well as the distribution of Compressed Natural Gas via land transportation and Bio Compressed Natural Gas derived from Palm Oil Mill Effluent. These businesses are represented by our subsidiary and joint ventures, namely, Gas Malaysia Green Ventures Sdn Bhd, Gas Malaysia Energy Advance Sdn Bhd and Gas Malaysia Synergy Drive Sdn Bhd.

# DEAR VALUED SHAREHOLDERS,

It gives me great pleasure to present the Annual Report 2024 of Gas Malaysia Berhad ("Gas Malaysia" or "the Group"). This year marked a pivotal transition from strategy introduction to implementation, guided by our GM32 Strategy, a 10-year strategic plan for Gas Malaysia. Despite challenges, our resilience and focused execution have driven significant transformation, operational excellence and sustainable growth. We remain committed to delivering reliable energy solutions and upholding the highest standards of governance and transparency.

Tan Sri Wan Zulkiflee Wan Ariffin

Chairman

# Macroeconomic and Industry Landscape

In 2024, Malaysia's economy grew by  $5.1\%$ , up from  $3.6\%$  in 2023, showing steady recovery despite global uncertainties. The domestic energy sector remained resilient, with robust performance overall, even as some sectors including rubber and steel industries faced market challenges. Government initiatives, such as the National Energy Transition Roadmap ("NETR"), emphasised the critical role of natural gas as a transitional fuel.

Market liberalisation spurred competition and innovation, prompting industry players to focus on efficiency and customer engagement. Gas Malaysia capitalised on these opportunities by refining its operations, strengthening its infrastructure and better meeting customers' expectations, demonstrating adaptability to evolving market conditions.

# CHARTING PATHS TOWARDS GREATER PROGRESS

# Progressing the GM32 Strategy

In 2024, the GM32 Strategy transitioned from vision to execution, achieving significant milestones. We expanded our Natural Gas Distribution System ("NGDS") by over 120 kilometres, enhancing infrastructure capacity and ensuring a reliable natural gas supply across Peninsular Malaysia. This continued expansion underscores our commitment to nation-building and long-term sustainable growth.

In our pursuit of delivering better customer experience, we have prioritised customer engagement, resulting in the successful renewal of gas supply agreements, improved service delivery and securing new customers. Notably, we have retained approximately  $97 \%$ of our existing customer base, further reinforcing trust and loyalty in our brand.

We have also made progress in the biomethane sector, securing our first certified biomethane customer and completing a feasibility study for a biomethanol project. These strategic initiatives are aimed at enhancing the diversification of our business portfolio and support the growing demand for cleaner energy solutions.

# Financial Performance

For the financial year ended 31 December 2024 ("FYE 2024"), Gas Malaysia recorded revenue of RM8.04 billion, a slight decrease of  $0.4\%$  from RM8.08 billion in 2023, mainly due to lower average selling prices of natural gas. However, profit after zakat and taxation increased by  $15.1\%$  to RM441.4 million, driven by higher sales volume, better contribution margin and increased tolling fees, despite higher administrative expenses.

The Board of Directors ("the Board") declared the first interim dividend of 6.31 sen per share on 27 August 2024 while the second interim dividend of 9.60 sen per share was declared on 18 February 2025. Together with the final dividend of 10.28 sen per share declared on 26 March 2025, the total dividend per share for FYE 2024 amounted to 26.19 sen per share which is equivalent to a payout of RM336.3 million.

To inculcate sustainable habits among our employees, we introduced the Zero Waste Programme, aimed at minimising single-use plastics, encouraging digital communication and embedding the principles of Reduce, Reuse and Recycle ("3R") into our workplace culture.

# Upholding Excellence in Transparency and Governance

Gas Malaysia strengthened its governance framework by enhancing the Board's composition with diverse skill sets in legal affairs, finance, mergers and acquisitions and strategy. Having this spectrum of skills on our Board has improved decision-making and oversight.

We also reinforced our commitment to integrity and ethical conduct through whistleblowing awareness programmes and anti-bribery and anti-corruption training. In addition, updates to our Code of Conduct ensured alignment with global best practices. Risk management remained a cornerstone, with regular enterprise risk assessments and structured reporting practices, while cybersecurity received heightened focus, with measures to safeguard critical infrastructure and sensitive data.

# Awards and Recognition

In 2024, Gas Malaysia received the 'Highest Return on Equity Over Three Years' and 'Highest Growth in Profit After Tax Over Three Years' awards at The Edge Billion Ringgit Club 2024 Corporate Awards, highlighting our financial excellence and resilience. We also won the National Occupational Safety and Health Award 2023, reflecting our commitment to maintaining high safety and health standards in the workplace.

We will also intensify our efforts to develop and implement relevant technologies to mitigate methane emissions, further enhancing operational efficiency and environmental stewardship.

Despite the competitive landscape presenting its fair share of challenges, we remain confident that our steadfast commitment to customer-centricity and operational excellence will drive sustainable growth. Our workforce, strengthened by the culture transformation initiated under the GM32 Strategy, will continue to be a key enabler of our long-term growth aspirations. We will continue to invest in talent development and culture transformation to ensure our employees are well-equipped to navigate the challenges of an increasingly competitive market.

As we navigate the year ahead, Gas Malaysia will remain agile and responsive to external developments, ensuring our strategies align with stakeholder expectations and evolving market dynamics. By building on the progress achieved in 2024, we aim to deliver sustainable value to our stakeholders while contributing meaningfully to the nation's energy transition and sustainability agenda.

# DEAR VALUED SHAREHOLDERS,

The year 2024 unfolded amidst a complex operating environment, shaped by global economic uncertainties and the energy sector's ongoing transformation. Domestically, demand for natural gas remained strong in line with Malaysia's resilient economic performance, leading to higher sales volume. With the Gas Malaysia Berhad ("Gas Malaysia" or "the Group")'s robust operational foundation providing a steady platform for growth, we were able to continue delivering meaningful returns to stakeholders.

Ahmad Hashimi Abdul Manap

President & Group Chief Executive Officer

As we marked over three (3) decades of service, 2024 proved to be a pivotal year in our journey towards achieving the ambitions of the GM32 Strategy, a 10-year strategic plan designed to strengthen our core business, explore adjacencies along the gas value chain and diversify into cleaner energy solutions. We made significant progress in expanding our infrastructure network, venturing into clean energy through biomethane and undertaking feasibility studies on biomethanol, as well as reinforcing our leadership in delivering reliable and sustainable energy solutions.

I am pleased to present Gas Malaysia's performance in 2024, highlighting our resilience, innovation and commitment to long-term value creation for all stakeholders. Through the disciplined execution of our strategies and the unwavering dedication of our team, we are well-positioned to navigate future challenges and seize opportunities in a dynamic energy landscape.

# ACCELERATING GROWTH, CREATING POSITIVE VALUE

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

# Revenue

Gas Malaysia's revenue reached RM8.04 billion in 2024, reflecting a slight  $0.4\%$  decline compared to 2023, primarily due to lower natural gas prices. However, the Group achieved an  $8.6\%$  increase in natural gas volume, which helped partially mitigate the impact of the price reduction.

# Costs and Expenses

Total costs and expenses for the Group decreased by  $1.4\%$  to RM7.47 billion, driven by the stabilisation of gas costs, which account for approximately  $96\%$  of total expenses. While additional costs, such as depreciation and amortisation related to the Natural Gas Distribution System ("NGDS") and human capital, partially offset these savings, the Group still achieved an overall reduction in expenses.

# Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Zakat, Depreciation and Amortisation ("EBITZDA")

EBITZDA increased to RM696.5 million in 2024, up from RM614.4 million in the previous year, driven by higher gross profit from increased natural gas volumes. However, these gains were partially offset by higher operating and overhead expenses.

# Finance Costs

The Group incurred finance costs of RM13.6 million in 2024, mainly attributed to the issuances of Islamic Medium-Term Notes and Islamic Commercial Papers. These financing instruments were used to support capital expenditure projects.

# Taxation

Tax expenses for 2024 amounted to RM148.4 million, an increase from RM131.7 million in 2023, primarily driven by a higher pre-tax profit for the year as well as effect of expenses not deductible for tax purposes.

# Profit After Zakat and Tax ("PAZT")

The Group's PAZT amounted to RM441.4 million in 2024, an increase from RM383.4 million in 2023, driven by higher EBITZDA.

# Gearing Ratio

The gross gearing ratio rose to  $22\%$  in 2024, up from  $20\%$  in the previous year, primarily due to the net issuance of RM100 million under the existing Sukuk programme. The issuances were used to finance capital expenditure projects, supporting the Group's commitment to expanding the NGDS network.

# Capital Expenditure

Capital expenditure for the year was RM267.1 million, with a focus on expanding the NGDS network, including the construction of gas pipelines and metering stations. In addition, funds were allocated to non-NGDS projects such as purchasing gas and office equipment, motor vehicles and advancing digitalisation efforts.

# Future Commitment

For 2025, the Group has committed approximately RM415.8 million in financial outlays under the Regulatory Period 2. This will support the development of more than 130 kilometres of NGDS pipelines along with other non-NGDS activities.

# HIGHLIGHTS OF 2024

# BUSINESS PERFORMANCE REVIEW

For the year under review, Gas Malaysia remained resilient amid evolving market dynamics, driven by our steadfast commitment to the GM32 Strategy. We made meaningful progress across both our core and new business segments, reinforcing our position as a trusted energy solutions provider.

Gas Malaysia's core businesses continued to deliver stable and reliable performance, supported by an expanding infrastructure network and a sustained focus on customer relationship management. Through strategic initiatives, we retained our market leadership while capturing new opportunities across diverse industries, demonstrating our ability to adapt and compete in a competitive business landscape.

The year 2024 also marked significant advancements in the Group's diversification efforts, particularly in clean energy initiatives. We made notable progress in our biomethane and biomethanol projects, laying the groundwork for long-term growth in alignment with global energy transition trends. These initiatives underscore our commitment to delivering innovative and sustainable energy solutions.

Operationally, we upheld our strong reputation for reliability and excellence. This was supported by the discipline and dedication of our experienced workforce, as well as ongoing investments in digitalisation. Guided by the GM32 Strategy, the Group remains well-positioned to navigate challenges and capitalise on opportunities, building a solid foundation for continued growth and stakeholder value creation.

# INFRASTRUCTURE

Gas Malaysia, through Gas Malaysia Distribution Sdn Bhd ("GMD"), made substantial strides in enhancing the gas pipeline infrastructure in 2024, focusing on the expansion and modernisation of the NGDS. We continued to expand the NGDS in 2024, growing it to 2,946 kilometres, an increase from 2,839 kilometres in 2023 across Peninsular Malaysia. This expansion saw the addition of 126 kilometres of pipelines, with 107 kilometres successfully commissioned during the year.

Notably, the 47 kilometres of pipeline to Tanjung Malim was commissioned ahead of schedule in December 2024, underscoring the Group's operational efficiency and commitment to timely delivery. This project is a critical development supporting the automotive industry's growth at PROTON City. Other key expansions included projects in Tebong, Bukit Sentosa, Simpang Ampat and several additional regions, complemented by the commissioning of 36 new stations to bolster distribution capabilities. These developments significantly strengthened the Group's capacity to meet growing energy demand and provide reliable access to natural gas for industrial, commercial and residential users.

Throughout the year, however, we encountered various challenges in executing our infrastructure projects. Delays occurred due to the time required to secure work permits from relevant authorities, while construction activities were further hindered by geographical complexities such as rocky terrain, swampy areas and narrow road reserve corridors, particularly in urban areas. These challenges were effectively managed through continuous engagements with authorities to facilitate construction work as well as meticulous selection of competent and experienced contractors.

# Effective Third-Party Monitoring

to ensure contractors' compliance with regulatory standards and proactive identification of potential challenges before project commencement.

In 2024, the System Average Interruption Duration Index ("SAIDI") stood at 0.6193 minutes per customer, while the emergency response time averaged 31.77 minutes. Although both metrics were within target, they represented a decline in performance compared to the previous year. The increase in SAIDI result was due to a leakage incident in Kuala Ketil, Kedah in July 2024, while the Emergency Response time saw a slight increase this year attributed to one (1) case in August 2024, where the response time exceeded 90 minutes.

# OUTLOOK AND PROSPECTS

At Gas Malaysia, we remain attuned to the evolving energy landscape, recognising the pivotal role of natural gas in the energy transition. As outlined in the National Energy Transition Roadmap, natural gas is expected to constitute up to  $56\%$  of the energy mix by 2050, up from  $43\%$  today. Against this backdrop, the long-term prospects for Gas Malaysia remain positive and we are well-positioned to sustain growth and support Malaysia's energy needs amid economic and regulatory uncertainties.

To reinforce our commitment to national energy security, we plan to expand our NGDS network to 4,000 kilometres by 2030, backed by a significant increase in capital expenditure. In the near term, expansion efforts will focus on strategic locations, including PROTON City, Tanjung Malim to support the automotive industry and collaborations with the Iskandar Regional Development Authority in Southern Johor to accelerate industrial growth. By broadening access to cleaner energy, these initiatives will enhance economic development and position natural gas as a key enabler for diverse industries.

Ongoing studies are focused on selecting the right technologies and developing projects to convert waste and biomass into clean energy, sustainable fuels and bio-feedstock for the chemical industry.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/6b976dff-742c-4a6f-a224-622f7f27db66/30f1e054d7fd1fb83e12e40c09c617defa7c2a47f28c5ed73da05c920999ff9c.jpg)

At the same time, we are enhancing our operational agility through strategic market engagement, infrastructure readiness and digitalisation. We continue working closely with industrial park developers and government investment agencies to optimise pipeline planning and drive demand growth. Anticipating future energy needs, we are also developing gas pipelines in high-potential areas ahead of demand, ensuring that investors have ready infrastructure to establish their presence.

As we strengthen our core business, we are also expanding into cleaner energy solutions. Our investments in biomethane and support Malaysia's low-carbon transition while offering industrial and commercial users energy-efficient alternatives. We are exploring opportunities to move up the gas value chain into regasification, and investing in bio-based fuels and new energy sources, further diversifying our long-term energy portfolio.

Ongoing studies are focused on selecting the right technologies and developing projects to convert waste and biomass into clean energy, sustainable fuels and bio-feedstock for the chemical industry.

Additionally, we are evaluating ways to enhance methane's value through pre-combustion carbon capture, producing high-purity graphene—an exceptionally strong, flexible and conductive material with applications across multiple industries, including rubber, synthetics, automotive, aerospace, construction, coatings, electronics and biomedicine.

These opportunities are being channelled through our structured stage-gate process, progressing systematically through various feasibility studies.

All these initiatives align with GM32 Strategy, a 10-year strategic plan for Gas Malaysia aimed at reinforcing our core and non-core businesses while capturing new opportunities across the gas value chain. With over 30 years of experience, we remain committed to advancing our role as a trusted energy partner, ensuring that Gas Malaysia continues delivering reliable, efficient and sustainable energy solutions to power the nation's future.

# MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT

Sustainability considerations are critical to what we do and how we do it. We conducted a materiality assessment in 2022 to identify urgent sustainability issues that were most material to our business and stakeholders, reflecting our commitment to responsible practices. The findings of the assessment were instrumental in defining our sustainability strategy and guiding our decision-making processes.

As part of the assessment, we reviewed several topics related to our operations and weighted their potential impacts on the environment, communities and society. The significance and relevance of each topic was then thoroughly analysed, with the outcome of the analysis compiled into a materiality matrix to visually explain the significance of each issue based on impact and stakeholder relevance.

The matrix showed us where our sustainability efforts and resources should be concentrated, enabling us to focus on the most material issues and develop targeted strategies and action plans to address them.

As the sustainability landscape is constantly changing with new issues emerging over time, Gas Malaysia remains dedicated to periodically reviewing and updating our materiality assessment to ensure continued relevance and effectiveness. We conducted a revalidation exercise in 2024 and found that our material matters continued to be appropriate for our business requirements and stakeholder expectations and remained largely consistent with our industry peers.

Our material assessment process comprises three (3) steps:

# Step 01

# IDENTIFICATION

- We identified a list of potential material matters that were most important to our stakeholders and Gas Malaysia by analysing the GRI Framework.  
- We specifically analysed the Sector Standards (GRI 11: Oil and Gas Sector) of this framework to identify potential material matters.  
- Based on our analysis, we identified a total of 22 potential material matters.

# Step 02

# STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT

- We then performed a validation process via surveys with internal stakeholders, namely our Board and MC members, to determine the relevancy of these matters to Gas Malaysia.  
- From the survey, nine (9) material matters were selected as relevant to Gas Malaysia's operations.

# Step 03

# PRIORITISATION

We prioritised the selected material matters based on two dimensions:  
- The importance of the material matter to the stakeholder  
The impact of the material matter on our business

We then mapped the selected material matters in our materiality matrix.

The next materiality assessment is scheduled to be conducted in 2025, in line with Bursa Malaysia's requirement to carry out a full materiality assessment once every three (3) years.

# Overview of Gas Malaysia's Sustainability Framework

Gas Malaysia's Sustainability Framework is anchored on four sustainability pillars and nine sustainability strategies, which focus on addressing the nine identified material topics.

# Asset Integrity and Critical Incident Management

For the Group, maintaining a sustainable and secure business model revolves around safeguarding asset integrity and effectively addressing critical incidents. Through stringent processes, such as regular inspections, testing and verification, we prevent potential hazards. We reinforce our commitment to safety by nurturing an environment focused on incident prevention, ensuring business continuity and protection.

# Our Approach

At the heart of our operations is a commitment to public safety, with a focus on minimising critical incidents that may endanger our assets and the environment. Preventing gas leaks during distribution is a priority, as such leaks can lead to injuries and environmental pollution, affecting the surrounding soil, water and air.

Checking odorant intensity levels

At our gas facilities, all third-party related works is approved and monitored through daily pipeline inspections by our Operations & Maintenance team, in line with our standard operating procedures ("SOPs"). Additionally, these inspections help us in identifying irregularities and avoiding any damage. Our dedicated on-call emergency response team is also ready to address any emergencies within 90 minutes of notification. These teams are deployed to minimise the risk of our operations to the public and mitigate potential damage to property and the environment.

In 2024, we experienced an increase in our System Average Interruption Duration Index ("SAIDI"), which rose to 0.6193 minutes per customer compared to 0.0040 minutes per customer in 2023. Our average response time also rose slightly to 31.77 minutes, from 23.87 minutes in 2023.

# Climate Adaptation, Resilience and Transition

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/6b976dff-742c-4a6f-a224-622f7f27db66/371a7903cf8e3fb0ff90bbc31f9f6686a6df7e2b73b40f978b7edcdd47d3d1be.jpg)

The impact of climate change continues to pose a significant challenge for us, affecting not only operational processes, but also our supply chains and long-term sustainability. In response to this pressing issue, we acknowledge the critical need for swift climate action, especially as extreme weather patterns threaten our production capabilities, distribution networks and access to essential resources.

Gas Malaysia is taking proactive measures to integrate sustainable practices and leverage eco-friendly technologies, aiming to create lasting, positive effects for communities and the environment. As part of our commitment to a low-carbon future, the Group has set out on a mission to reduce GHG emissions by promoting the use of natural gas among consumers. Through these efforts, we aim to help our stakeholders build resilience against the challenges posed by changing environmental conditions.

# Our Approach

We are actively addressing climate risks associated with Gas Malaysia and implementing mitigation strategies.

# Biomethane

Gas Malaysia has been at the forefront of providing innovative and sustainable energy solutions ever since executing its first Gas Purchase Agreement in 2019. Through agreements with palm oil millers and waste management operators, the Company has enabled the offtake and purchase of biomethane produced from Palm Oil Mill Effluent ("POME") and organic waste, which is then integrated into the NGDS network.

In 2024, Gas Malaysia Green Ventures Sdn Bhd ("GMGV") injected 149,611 MMBtu into the NGDS and signed two (2) Gas Purchase Agreements with palm oil mill operators. Building on this foundation, Gas Malaysia continues to explore new opportunities for expanding its clean energy offerings and furthering its commitment to climate protection.

# GHG Emissions

Natural gas plays a crucial role in our energy transition, being recognised as a cleaner alternative to other fossil fuels. It generates up to  $50\%$  less carbon dioxide  $(\mathrm{CO}^{2})$  emissions compared to coal. The Group further maximises the environmental benefits by efficiently generating electricity and heat through gas-powered combined heat and power ("CHP") systems in partnership with its joint ventures. These systems not only reduce fuel consumption by  $32\%$ , but also lower annual carbon emissions by  $50\%$  in comparison to coal-based generation.

Our commitment to sustainability is also reflected in our transparent approach to GHG emissions reporting. By adhering to recognised international frameworks, we maintain our strict and consistent approach towards Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions reporting. This disciplined reporting allows us to gain deeper insights into our environmental footprint, which in turn strengthens our ability to implement effective strategies aimed at reducing energy consumption and further curbing emissions. We calculate our GHG emissions using the operational control approach, in line with the GHG Protocol Corporate Standards, and ensure that our measurements adhere to the IPCC 2006 Guidelines.

# Scope 1 Emissions

Direct emissions from sources under the control or ownership of Gas Malaysia

* The 2023 data was reinstated to exclude the electricity generated and sold to customers from Jomalina's plant.

We are in the process of gathering data for Scope 3 emissions, specifically for Categories 6 (Employee Commuting) and 7 (Business Travel). This information will be included in our disclosures in the upcoming year.

# Energy Management

While managing energy efficiently remains fundamental to our business, we have seen an increase in our total energy consumption, which reflects a larger carbon footprint than anticipated. Our vehicles continue to rely on diesel and petrol, and our offices and stations still depend on electricity for power, indicating areas where we can further optimise energy usage. In 2024, our progress towards decarbonisation included installing solar panels at our Head Office and Southern Regional Office and completing an electric vehicle ("EV") pilot for our fleet.

In FYE 2024, our total energy consumption was 4,386,773 GJ compared to 3,123,109 GJ in the previous year. This increase was primarily due to the full-year operation of one (1) of our new CHP plants in Penang, resulting in higher natural gas consumption.

Waste Management

At Gas Malaysia, we continue to prioritise sustainable waste management practices, focusing on minimising landfill waste. Through our continuous waste management efforts, we aim to safeguard the environment, enhance our corporate image, ensure the welfare of our employees and realise significant cost efficiencies.

# Our Approach

In line with the Environmental Quality Act 1974, we take a responsible approach to managing scheduled waste. We systematically classify it into categories, which include:

# SW1

Metal and metal-bearing waste

# SW2

Waste containing inorganic constituents which may contain metals and organic materials

# SW3

Waste containing principally organic constituents which may contain metals and inorganic materials

# SW4

Waste which contains inorganic or organic constituents

# SW5

Other waste (residue from treatment or recovery of scheduled waste)

In 2024, our total waste disposal containing mercury or its compounds ("SW109") was 0.06 MT, a decrease from 0.10 MT in 2023.

Water Consumption  $(\mathfrak{m}^{3})$

As climate change places increasing pressure on water availability, we are committed to using water responsibly across our operations. This approach ensures a steady supply, enhances cost efficiency and reinforces our sustainability efforts.

# Our Approach

Our water usage supports both everyday office activities and essential auxiliary processes in our facilities. In FYE 2024, we recorded a higher water consumption of  $13,135 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$  compared to  $11,653 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$  in FYE 2023.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/6b976dff-742c-4a6f-a224-622f7f27db66/cfa90e7633f00e6cf10a135fd56a21b456514401137f33b7eb3873c857c92687.jpg)

The substantial increase in water consumption at stations in 2024 was primarily due to the expansion of our pipeline network, which led to an increase in the number of stations. Additionally, undetected ruptures in the water pipeline at one of our odoriser stations, caused by grass-cutting activities, contributed to the rise. To mitigate future risks, we have re-routed approximately 400 metres of the pipeline to reduce similar ruptures.

# TASK FORCE ON CLIMATE-RELATED FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES ("TCFD")

Our focus continues to be on identifying potential climate risks and crafting targeted strategies to mitigate their long-term impacts. Building on the progress made in FYE 2023, climate risks have been preliminarily identified by Risk Coordinators in FYE 2024 and will be assessed further in 2025. This demonstrates our ongoing commitment to aligning with the guidelines outlined in the TCFD framework. In addition, we are actively implementing internal measures to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. These measures include the conclusion of the EV pilot test for our fleet, the purchase of carbon credits and the monitoring of electricity generated from solar power.

# Transparent and Fair Procurement Practices

# Our Approach

At Gas Malaysia, the Group upholds strict compliance with laws and regulations while remaining committed to ethical and responsible business practices. This aligns with our dedication to upholding the highest standards of integrity and governance. Our goal is to deliver cleaner, safer, more reliable and cost-effective energy solutions to our industrial, commercial and residential customers, reinforcing our position as Malaysia's leading gas provider.

The Group is also steadfast in adopting sustainable and responsible business practices. We continue to emphasise effective risk management, investment in sustainable solutions and consistent stakeholder engagement. Through these efforts, we aim to contribute to the growth of the gas industry, while meeting the nation's energy needs sustainably.

We recognise that upholding the highest standards of business ethics is not only essential to the sustainability of our operations, but also crucial to our long-term success. Across the procurement process, our unwavering commitment to fairness and transparency remains central to our approach to accountability and integrity. Our focus is on building a resilient and sustainable supply chain by cultivating strong, collaborative partnerships with our suppliers, while actively mitigating potential risks.

In line with this, we take a proactive approach by confirming vendors' interest before inviting them to participate in tenders. By leveraging our e-Procurement system, we improve efficiency, transparency and stakeholder management. This approach simplifies procurement processes, consolidates information and ensures greater traceability in vendor and contractor management.

# Sustainability Statement

# Our Progress/Achievements

Throughout FYE 2024, Gas Malaysia maintained a fair and transparent procurement process by adhering to a tendering system that ensures competitive bidding and promotes accountability. We work closely with a pool of qualified contractors and suppliers who meet stringent criteria, such as having the necessary licences, technical capabilities and financial stability, to ensure effective delivery of goods and services.

In line with enhancing procurement efficiency, our e-Procurement system played a crucial role in improving transparency and simplifying processes. By centralising procurement activities and enabling easy access to relevant information, the system supports better decision-making and streamlines document handling, contributing to more organised operations.

A key initiative in 2024 was the further digitalisation of procurement processes through the e-Procurement system. This effort supports our sustainability goals by reducing paper usage, minimising environmental impact and promoting sustainable operational practices. For more information on initiatives, please refer to our Environmental section.

Additionally, Gas Malaysia demonstrated a strong commitment to local businesses, allocating approximately  $99.3\%$  of its RM450 million procurement expenditure to local suppliers in FYE 2024, with only  $0.7\%$  (RM3.2 million) being spent on international vendors. This reflects the Group's dedication to supporting the national economy.

Gas Malaysia is committed to resolving grievances promptly to ensure a conducive work environment that improves morale, as well as the quality and quantity of work output. Our policy stipulates that we assess the merit of the grievance before proceeding promptly to an investigation, if necessary. Employees with grievances are advised to file a report with their immediate supervisor. However, if the grievance involves their immediate supervisor, the employee is allowed to escalate the matter to either the Human Resources Department or a person at a level above their immediate superior.

The Human Resources Department will meet with the employee lodging the complaint to better understand their grievance. If the grievance involves the employee's immediate supervisor or head of department, both parties will be called in for a meeting with the Human Resources Department. Grievances that cannot be resolved at the department level will be escalated to the PGCEO.

Additionally, the Group complies with the Occupational Safety and Health Act 1994 and ensures the proper implementation of its HSEQ management systems.

# Our Approach

We aim to keep our employees and local communities safe by upholding the highest OSH standards. To this end, we instil a culture of safety risk management across the Group, fostering a sense of accountability to our customers and stakeholders. We are governed by strict Health, Safety and Environment ("HSE") policies and management systems that align with the requirements set by the International Organization for Standardization ("ISO") and other statutory requirements.

# Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment and Risk Control ("HIRARC")

At Gas Malaysia, we recognise that unforeseen accidents and incidents may still occur despite our best efforts to embed safety considerations across our operations. Our HIRARC procedure is foundational to our approach towards addressing and mitigating these occurrences. It facilitates hazard identification, risk assessment and the implementation of risk control measures to foster health and safety at work.

We employ a systematic approach that includes consultation, training, brainstorming sessions, workplace inspections and accident investigations, all of which form the basis for establishing the HIRARC Register and the Environmental Aspect and Impact Register.

We assess OSH risks through consultation, training and brainstorming sessions. Using Accident Investigation Reports or near-miss incident logs, we identify the root causes of the risks, analyse trends and evaluate the likelihood and probability of incidents recurring. Each activity's risk is evaluated based on the likelihood of occurrence and the severity of potential outcomes through a Risk Matrix Chart. Preventive and mitigative control measures are then implemented and recorded in the HIRARC register, with their effectiveness monitored to finalise the risk ranking as either High, Moderate or Low.

Following an incident resulting in fatalities, injuries, restricted work, ill health, dangerous occurrences or property damage, we will establish an investigation team comprising representatives from the respective department or function, the HSE Committee and an independent department or function.

The team will perform a fact-finding mission and produce a report within 14 working days, seeking expert opinions where necessary. The information gathered is then analysed to determine the root cause of the incident. The team will propose appropriate control measures to prevent incident recurrence, with implementation and monitoring of these measures managed by the Person-in-Charge ("PIC") of the respective department or function.

# Sustainability Statement

# Work-Related Injuries

Our commitment to preventing workplace injuries, illnesses and fatalities is demonstrated through our comprehensive approach and practices aimed at protecting the health and safety of employees in our operations. In 2024, we recorded zero fatalities and one case of work-related injury due to an employee slipping and falling at work.

Going forward, we remain committed to identifying hazards and risks using our HIRARC procedure. Furthermore, we will continue to enhance our OSH initiatives by implementing further measures.

# Employees' Training on Occupational Safety and Health

Beyond adhering to policies, regulations and procedures, the Group prioritises fostering a strong safety culture among employees. This involves creating awareness and regularly reminding workers about the rules and measures that increase the effectiveness of our HSEQ initiatives. In 2024, a total of 65 employees were given health and safety training to enhance their OSH knowledge.

Worker Participation, Consultation and Communication on OSH

Gas Malaysia's Steering HSE Committee was established as a platform for employees to discuss matters related to safety, health and welfare. Beyond addressing OSH issues, the committee is also tasked with establishing policies, procedures, rules and relevant regulations. In addition, it has the authority to make decisions on any OSH-related matters. To meet regulatory requirements, Gas Malaysia's branch offices with at least 40 employees have established their own OSH committees.

The Steering HSE Committee at Gas Malaysia Head Office ("HQ") serves as a platform for the staff to discuss matters related to safety, health and welfare. In addition to discussing OSH - related issues, this committee is also responsible for establishing policies, procedures, rules and relevant regulations and has decision-making authority on any OSH - related issues. Instead of the Steering HSE Committee, Gas Malaysia's remote office with 40 employees or more will set up their own OSH committee in accordance with the law.

The Steering HSE Committee comprises a chairman (PGCEO), a secretary (Head of Group HSEQ) and the head of Section/Head of Department as management representatives, while executive or non-executive employees from various departments, functions and subsidiaries are appointed as workers' representatives. Additionally, we have established HSE sub-committees, namely the Facilities HSE sub-committee and Technical HSE sub-committee, to support and help communicate information and action plans across the Group. The HSE sub-committees serve as a bridge for OSH-related issues requiring management decisions.

The Steering HSE Committee and HSE sub-committees meet every three months. Furthermore, the Steering HSE Committee is responsible for organising quarterly workplace inspections and investigating any accidents that occur.

Additionally, we adhere to relevant laws and regulations while embedding international best practices into our governance approach. We continue to adopt the T.R.U.S.T. principles and the ABMS, which are aligned with ISO 37001:2016 standards. Our commitment to ethical business practices was reinforced with the achievement of the ISO 37001:2016 ABMS Certification from SIRIM QAS in 2023.

# Our Progress/Achievements

Gas Malaysia remains focused on strengthening its anti-corruption measures through policy enhancements, in-depth risk analysis, reinforced controls and systematic enforcement.

# Sustainability Statement

# Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption

We continue to cultivate a strong culture of integrity as a cornerstone of effective corporate governance across Gas Malaysia. This commitment is underscored by the responsibility entrusted to our Group Integrity and Governance. Their key role involves overseeing complaint management, detecting instances of non-compliance and continuously strengthening the organisation's integrity and governance standards.

Additionally, our dedication is further supported by a comprehensive ABAC Policy and Framework, which targets the eradication of corruption in all forms. To further reinforce this commitment, we implemented training programmes designed to deepen our employees' understanding of key issues related to bribery and corruption, raise awareness and equip our workforce to effectively navigate these challenges.

In-house trainings have been conducted through a series of sessions throughout the year to accommodate employees from various levels and functions. As of 2024,  $100\%$  of employees regardless of their position, have successfully completed the anti-bribery and anti-corruption training.

The diagram below further illustrates our in-house training programmes in 2024:

Our Gifts Guideline establishes a clear approach for handling gifts between employees, customers, vendors, contractors and other third parties. It categorises gift types, defines the declaration process and requires approval in accordance with the Gas Malaysia Berhad's Limits of Authority ("LOA"). The aim is to ensure that gifts are not misused, safeguarding against potential conflicts of interest or personal gain.

# Operations Assessed for Corruption-Related Risks

As part of our dedication to eradicating corruption and fostering sustainable growth in our organisation, we regularly evaluate our operations to identify and mitigate any corruption-related risks. We actively conduct a series of CRA sessions across all Gas Malaysia's business units to ensure ongoing vigilance and progress in this area.

In 2024, all planned assessments of corruption risks were completed for all business units within Gas Malaysia's operations.

# Communication and Training on Anti-Corruption

Educating our people on the importance of upholding best practices to prevent bribery and corruption remains crucial. These behaviours not only breach our corporate principles, but are also unlawful, exposing both our employees and the organisation to the risk of financial penalties and harm to our reputation. To support this, we have conducted comprehensive briefing and awareness sessions on Anti-Corruption Policies and Procedures for all Gas Malaysia employees, including the Board of Directors.

# Percentage of Board of Directors informed on Anti-Corruption Policies and Procedures

The Board of Directors of Gas Malaysia approved the revised Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy and Framework during its meeting on 16 February 2023.  
- Our Board Member, Atsunori Takeuchi, who was appointed effective 1 June 2024, received a briefing on the framework on 26 August 2024.

# Percentage of Employees informed on Anti-Corruption Policies and Procedures

Employees from all levels are kept informed through email blasts, e-bulletins and the Integrity Portal on SharePoint. In addition, the policies are made available on the Company website and intranet, with further visibility through noticeboards, bunting and display stands.  
- Induction sessions and the ABAC awareness video further ensure employees are well-educated on the policies.

# Anti-Competitive Behaviour

Gas Malaysia supports a competitive business environment, recognising its role in driving innovation and efficiency. Fair competition encourages competitive pricing, better product and service quality, greater consumer choice and overall improved value. We are committed to complying with local and international laws on anti-competitive behaviour and monopolistic practices. Our focus is on preventing actions that may limit competition, restrict production capacity or create monopolies in distribution, transport and supply.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/6b976dff-742c-4a6f-a224-622f7f27db66/cbd412555cb7db3c92b1b946555f8084261033d353201d8bde1439f12061afe1.jpg)

# Our Approach

The TPA regulatory framework plays a key role in addressing anti-competitive practices by enabling third-party entities to access gas facilities they do not own or operate. This system opens the market to multiple players, ensuring broader access to gas facilities across Malaysia.

In line with market liberalisation in January 2022, we restructured our operations into two separate entities — GMD and GMES. Both entities, wholly owned by Gas Malaysia, hold distribution and shipping licences, reinforcing a more competitive and transparent market. GMD holds a 20-year distribution licence, which allows it to develop, operate, and maintain the NGDS in Peninsular Malaysia, ensuring the safe and reliable delivery of gas to customers. Meanwhile, GMES, with a 10-year shipping licence, functions as a gas shipper, sourcing gas and delivering it to meet customers' requirements.

Notes for the Bursa Sustainability Performance Report on pages 70 and 71:

- For Bursa C4(a) data in 2023 and 2024 on total energy consumption, the unit of measurement reported in the sustainability statement was in GJ. However, to comply with Bursa Malaysia's requirements for the unit of measurement to be in MW, we have converted GJ into MW at a rate of 1 GJ to 0.278 MW.  
For Bursa C6(a) data in 2023 on total hours of training by employee category, the figures represent average training hours per employee rather than total hours of training by employee category. The correct total hours of training by employee category are 4,746 hours for Management and 20,066 hours for Non-Management in 2023.  
- The  $(^{*})$ Restated 2024 data in the Bursa Sustainability Performance Table on page 70 is due to an unintentional input error made during the submission process on the Bursa ESG Reporting Platform. The breakdown of the 2,422 beneficiaries of the investment in communities in 2024 are as follows: 350 students, 720 homeless individuals, 2 children with congenital heart conditions, 1,100 Yayasan Pelajaran MARA students and 250 families.

# A) RISK MANAGEMENT

# 1) GROUP'S RISK AND COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FRAMEWORK

The Board has devised its own risk and compliance management policies and procedures framework which is in line with the industry best practices for the purpose of managing risks and compliance in the Group.

# Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control

# NOTE 2

# RISK AND SUSTAINABILITY COMMITTEE

The RSC is responsible to assist the Board to oversee the establishment and implementation of an enterprise risk management system. The RSC is also responsible to review the effectiveness of the system annually.

The RSC consists of at least three (3) Board members including the Chairman, who is a Non-Executive Director. The RSC is required to determine the Group's level of risk appetite. Furthermore, they are to assess and examine key business risks so that the shareholders' investments and the Group's assets are safeguarded.

The scope, duties and responsibilities of RSC are as follows:

A

To review the processes for determining and communicating the Group's risk appetite.

B

To oversee the establishment and implementation of the risk management system of the Group of which the effectiveness of the system is reviewed annually.

At the same time, they will be able to ensure that timely actions are taken by the Management to alleviate the risks.

# 3) RISK IDENTIFICATION PROCESS AND ANALYSIS

Risk identification starts with the risk coordinators from each department. The appointed risk coordinators seek to identify risks which may in any way affect the Group's objectives. The consideration shall include economic, reputation and compliance objectives. The risks will then be measured and registered in terms of likelihood and impact of incidence.

The main objective of this process is to appropriately identify, evaluate and respond to the risks identified in order to protect the Group from loss, uncertainty and loss of opportunities.

# Legend:

The main responsibility of risk coordinators would be to identify risks and subsequently map them to the risk register. Next, the compiled risks will be communicated to the respective HOCs and HODs. Risks that are categorised as major will be forwarded to the RCMC for its deliberation.

# Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control

# 4) GAS MALAYSIA RISK REGISTER ("GRR")

All risks previously identified will be recorded in the GRR. The compilation will then be reviewed by the RCMC.

After the completion of the reviewing process, the RSC will be informed about the most significant risks identified. The rating or score is determined based on the consequences, root cause and the current capability of controls the Group has to mitigate the resultant impact.

# 5) BUSINESS CONTINUITY MANAGEMENT MANUAL ("BCMM")

BCMM was created with the objective of achieving the Group's goal which is to minimise the effect of any incident on employees, business partners, local community and environment. It is of utmost importance that business functions will continue to function even in the event of a crisis.

BCMM covers two (2) major elements, which are Emergency Management ("EM") and Business Continuity Management ("BCM"). EM is a programme created to control the overall culmination of a physical incident within a business unit. The programme integrates both operations response to an emergency as well as supporting staff functions such as law, insurance, public affairs and human resources.

On the other hand, BCM's main function is to protect corporate assets from an actual or potential threat caused by either a catastrophic incident, a non-physical event or series of negative developments which escalate to crisis proportions. BCMM underlines the strategies and actions to be taken during the incident. It relies on an equalised evaluation of probable impact on the Group's operations, image and liability. Through systematic management in place, BCMM strives to handle those impacts so that the business recovery can be accelerated.

In order to ensure that sufficient resources are readily accessible, the plan undergoes constant reassessment, testing and auditing process. Due to the organization's restructuring in the middle of 2024, the testing exercise was rescheduled, along with the ongoing of internal process enhancements efforts. These continuous updates and improvements are significant to ensure that it remains relevant and allows the Group to effectively and efficiently face the challenges posed by any incidents.

As a means to facilitate the above, the Group has prepared the following:

# a) Emergency Response Plan ("ERP")

The creation of ERP is an embodiment of the Group's commitment towards responding effectively to all emergencies that affect the Group. The plan strives to assure that immediate and effective response can be taken during emergency situations. This is achieved by providing training as well as maintaining adequate resources in dealing with crisis. The main goal of ERP is to minimise the after-effect of an emergency by minimising the risk to the public and employees and at the same time, protecting property and limiting damages to the environment.

Generally, the ERP revolves around on-site procedures which are to be performed by related personnel when an emergency occurs. The main priority of this measure would be the safety of the people, the protection of the public as well as the conservation of the environment wherein the damage must be kept as minimal as possible. However, it is important to note that due to the volatile and irregular nature of emergencies, most procedures are presented as general guidelines rather than inflexible rules.

# b) Computer Disaster Recovery Centre ("CDRC")

CDRC is a coordinated process of restoring crucial systems, data and infrastructures that are required to sustain the key on-going business operations during a crisis. The Group has set up its own CDRC, where core and main servers for the Group's IT operations are replicated outside the main operation buildings. The centre will also host the backup Operation Control Room ("OCR") in which, it has a similar function as the main OCR located at the Head Office. All these will make it possible for the critical data to remain safely intact and uncorrupted when disaster occurs.

# c) Health, Safety, Environment and Quality ("HSEQ") Policy

The HSEQ Policy outlines the strong commitment of the Group towards its employees, business partners and the general public. Each and every practical and possible step identified will be considered and monitored by the Steering HSE Committee, chaired by the PGCEO. As a result, the organization has achieved two (2) consecutive years with zero lost-time injuries ("LTI"), totalling to 4,176,376 safe man-hours recorded as of 2024. These demonstrate a steadfast commitment by the organization in fostering a safe, healthy and a conducive work environment.

# Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control

# B) KEY ELEMENTS OF INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM ("ICS")

Outlined below are the other essential components of the Group's internal control system:

# 1) GOVERNANCE AND CONTROL ENVIRONMENT

- Delegation of responsibilities between the Board and the Management are clearly defined. This is done via proper documentation of authorisation procedures as well as line of accountability for authorisation, approval and control procedures. In line with that, a Limits of Authority framework is prepared to establish the availability of limits to govern the functions within the scope. Significant transactions such as major tenders, acquisitions and disposals must be approved by the Board.  
- The Standard Operating Procedures ("SOPs") are regularly updated parallel with the latest developments in the Group to ensure that they will remain relevant at all times. The SOPs would document the internal control procedures including how specific objectives can be achieved based on respective processes.  
ISO 9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015, ISO 45001:2018, ISO/IEC 27001:2022 & ISO 37001:2016 are certifications obtained for the Group's operational processes.

# 2) RISK ASSESSMENT

Regular meetings will be held amongst the HOCs and HODs to discuss any recent major risk issues affecting the Group and control procedures to mitigate those risks. These meetings allow quality decisions to be made and at the same time, promoting teamwork in problem-solving.

# 3) ANTI-BRIBERY AND ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICY AND FRAMEWORK

The Group is committed to conduct its business professionally, ethically and with the highest standards of integrity. Taking into cognizance Section 17A of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (Amendment) Act 2018 that came into force in June 2020, the Group therefore adopted and implemented an Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy and Framework on 16 February 2020. The Policy was later reviewed, revised and approved by the Board of Directors on 16 February 2023. Minor amendments were made related to the change of Whistleblowing e-mail address domain, Policy Statement, Disclosures of Improper Conduct, Investigation Report and Revocation of Whistleblower Protection.

# 4) CONTROL ACTIVITIES

Control activities are performed at all levels within the Group through policies and procedures to ensure that Management's directives to mitigate risks in achieving business objectives are carried out. Relevant control activities within the Group include operational controls, financial reporting controls, internal and external audits and whistleblowing policy.

# 5) INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION

The implementation of an Enterprise Resource Planning system facilitates a smooth flow of information among critical business functions within the Group. In return, it increases the quality of control and efficiency of operations.

# 6) MONITORING

- The Group Internal Audit Department has been assigned the responsibility to conduct reviews on the governance, risk management and internal controls of the Group. Subsequently, recommendations will be proposed to the Management should there be any room for improvement. The findings and recommendations will then be reported to the Audit Committee. The Committee shall act as the representative of the Board to put all the notions into consideration regarding the efficiency and sufficiency of the Group's internal controls.  
- Every month, the monthly performance will be analysed against the budget and the comparative preceding year's performance by Accounting and Finance Department. The findings will be tabled to the Management during the monthly Management Committee meeting. This is done prior to the data being reported to the Audit Committee and the Board on a quarterly basis. This allows constant and timely performance monitoring. As such, any issues which impede the budget achievement goal is addressed early in an effective manner.  
- The Group has engaged external auditors to perform limited assurance review on the Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control ("SORMIC") document in accordance with Audit and Assurance Practice Guide ("AAPG") 3 issued by the Malaysian Institute of Accountants and report their findings to the Group's Board of Directors.

# Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control

- The external auditors will highlight significant deficiencies in internal control noted during the course of their audit of the statutory financial statements of Gas Malaysia Berhad and its subsidiaries. They will also provide recommendations to mitigate those weaknesses in internal controls and to seek the management action plans, and thereafter, report to the Audit Committee.

The Board and Management acknowledge the importance of constant monitoring of the Group. This is due to the ever-changing nature of the risks faced by the Group. Hence, to ensure the process is up to date, improvement and enhancement of the internal control must be conducted on an on-going basis to ensure that all probable impact of the identified risks can be mitigated timely.

# RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM EFFECTIVENESS

The regular assessment by the Board to ensure an effective risk management and internal control systems of the Group is conducted through the following mechanisms:

- To begin with, the Board utilises numerous data and tools to measure whether the current risk management and internal control systems are still effective and relevant with the current condition. The data and tools include comparison between actual and planned performance, key financial as well as operational performance.  
- Subsequently, the Management shall keep the Board updated on the Group's performance in relation to the plans and developments of both internal and external aspects. These discussions will be held on a quarterly basis. In addition, specific transactions, projects or opportunities will be discussed with the Board when the need arises. This allows the Board to determine if there are any new risks which need to be addressed as well as highlight elements of action plans and internal controls which must be enhanced for better results.  
- Afterwards, all the improvements required will be addressed appropriately. These actions were carried out based on the results of reviews by the internal auditors. The outcome of the reviews will be discussed with the Audit Committee while the follow-up monitoring tasks will be carried out by the Management and internal auditors.  
- Ultimately, the overall risk management activities and risk registers will be presented to the Board at least twice (2) a year. This is done to provide a complete overview of the Group's key risks and how they are being managed.

# COMMENTARY ON THE ADEQUACY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROLS SYSTEMS

The Board agrees that the risk management and system of internal control practices as described above are effective and cover up to the date of the approval of this statement for inclusion in the annual report. For the financial year under review, the Board is satisfied that the system of internal controls and risk management processes are adequate and sound in providing reasonable assurance in safeguarding shareholders' investments, the Group's assets and other stakeholders' interests as well as in addressing key risks impacting the business operations of the Group. There was no major internal control weakness identified that may result in any material loss or uncertainty that would require disclosure in this annual report.

# CONCLUSION

For the financial year under review, based on inquiries, information and assurances provided by the PGCEO and Group Chief Financial Officer, the Board is of the view that the Group's risk management and system of internal controls are operating adequately and effectively, in all material respects.

This Statement is made in accordance with a resolution of the Board of Directors dated 26 March 2025.

# REVIEW BY EXTERNAL AUDITORS

As required by Paragraph 15.23 of the Bursa Securities MMLR, the external auditors have reviewed this SORMIC and reported to the Board that nothing has come to their attention that causes them to believe that the SORMIC intended to be included in the Annual Report is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the disclosures required by paragraphs 41 and 42 of the Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control: Guidelines for Directors of Listed Issuers, nor is the SORMIC factually inaccurate. Their limited assurance review was performed in accordance with AAPG 3 issued by the Malaysian Institute of Accountants. AAPG 3 does not require the external auditors to form an opinion on the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management and internal control systems of the Group.

# Nomination & Remuneration Committee Report

The Nomination & Remuneration Committee (“NRC”) Report is prepared in accordance with Paragraph 15.08A(3) of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad’s (“Bursa Securities”) Main Market Listing Requirements (“MMLR”). This report sets out the activities of the NRC in discharging its duties for the year under review.

The composition of the NRC complies with Paragraph 15.08A(1) of the MMLR of Bursa Securities which states that a nominating committee shall comprise exclusively of non-executive directors, a majority of whom must be independent.

The details of NRC members and their attendance records at the NRC meetings held during the financial year ended 31 December 2024 ("FYE 2024") are as follows:

# Recruitment and Annual Assessment of Directors

One of the key functions of the NRC is to manage the nomination and selection of candidates to the Board. For the assessment and selection of Directors, the NRC is guided by the Fit and Proper Policy of the Group and shall consider the following factors of the prospective Directors:

- Character, experience, skills, knowledge, expertise and competence;  
Professionalism;  
- Commitment (including time commitment), contribution and performance;  
- Integrity;  
- In the case of candidates for the position of Independent Non-Executive Directors, the NRC will evaluate the candidates' ability to discharge such responsibilities/functions as expected from Independent Non-Executive Directors; and  
Boardroom diversity.

During the year under review, the NRC had deliberated and reviewed the current Board's composition. Upon the retirement of Encik Nobuhisa Kobayashi at the  $33^{\text{rd}}$  AGM of the Company on 30 May 2024, the NRC reviewed and assessed Encik Atsunori Takeuchi, nominee director of Tokyo Gas, focusing on his character, integrity, expertise, time and commitment. The NRC is satisfied that he has fulfilled the required criteria set by the Fit and Proper Policy. With the recommendation of the NRC and after reviewing his vast knowledge and experience in the gas utility sector, the Board approved his appointment as a Non-Independent Non-Executive Director of the Company with effect from 1 June 2024.

The NRC undertakes an annual assessment on the effectiveness of the Board as a whole, its Committees, the contribution of each individual Director, including IDs, as well as the required mix of skills, experience and other qualities of the Board members, including core competencies which IDs should bring to the Board.

For the year under review, the evaluation was conducted through the questionnaires circulated to the Board covering various aspects pertaining to Board effectiveness such as Board mix and composition, principal responsibilities of the Board, Board process, PGCEO performance and succession planning, Board governance and Environmental, Social & Governance ("ESG") issues.

# Nomination & Remuneration Committee Report

Additional questionnaires on independent directorship were provided to all IDs. Outcomes of the evaluations are generated based on the Directors' feedbacks on the questionnaires. Upon evaluation, the NRC will consider and recommend measures to upgrade the effectiveness of the Board and its Committees. All evaluations carried out by the NRC in the discharge of all its functions are properly documented.

Based on the evaluation conducted for the financial year under review, the Board opined that the existing structure of the Board is highly effective due to the following:

- The Company has a well-balanced Board. The Board is of the right size and comprises of individuals who have diverse skills, knowledge, experience and expertise that combines to provide different perspectives and effective board dynamics. Thus, it enables effective and constructive deliberations whereby any decision made is founded on detailed and balance considerations.  
- The Directors are committed, continuously remain highly effective by demonstrating good judgement, credibility, strategic thinking, industry knowledge and decision-making ability, and have discharged their responsibilities and fiduciary duties as members of the Board.  
- The Board has sound knowledge and understanding of the Group's business and challenges as well as the industry in which the Group operates and is able to chart strategic direction of the Group.  
- Moving forward, the Board will continue to focus on refining its governance practices, ensuring strategic alignment, and fostering a culture of continuous improvement to uphold the Company's long-term success and resilience.

The results of these evaluation form the basis of the NRC's recommendations to the Board for the re-election of Directors at the forthcoming AGM of the Company.

# Additional Compliance Information

STATUS OF COMPLIANCE ON PLOTS OF LAND ERECTED WITH GAS MALAYSIA'S STATIONS WHICH ARE NOT DESIGNATED FOR GAS STATION USE

On 1 December 2015, GMB announced that an application for an extension of time for Gas Malaysia to comply with the condition imposed by Securities Commission (“SC”) to identify those plots of land erected with stations which are not designated for gas station use and rectify the non-compliance (“the Conditions”) was submitted to SC.

Further thereto, Gas Malaysia had on 6 January 2016 announced that SC has decided that Gas Malaysia will no longer be required to observe the stipulated timeframe resolving the Conditions imposed by SC on the outstanding Affected Stations. Instead, Gas Malaysia is required to continue to pursue the matter with the relevant authorities subject to the following:

(a) Gas Malaysia is to provide an undertaking that they will resolve the non-compliances of the nine (9) outstanding Affected Stations;  
(b) Gas Malaysia is to disclose the efforts taken by them and status of compliance of the nine (9) outstanding Affected Stations in the annual report until such time the non-compliance is resolved; and  
(c) Maybank Investment Bank Berhad/Gas Malaysia is to update the SC when such disclosure is made in the annual report.

Over the years, the Condition in respect of six (6) out of the nine (9) outstanding Affected Stations have been rectified and resolved, as follows:  
(a) District station located at Jalan Bukit Kemuning, Shah Alam, Selangor:

(b) District station located at Jalan Haji Sirat, Taman Klang Utama, Klang, Selangor:

Terminated and dismantled on 17 February 2016. The affected customers of this station continue to receive the gas supply through another district station located on a piece of industrial land.

Terminated and dismantled on 27 June 2019. The customer from this station continues to receive the gas supply through the new district station located within the customer's premise, where the land express condition is for industrial use.

(c) District station located at Jalan Tun Sambanthan, Kuala Lumpur:

The landlord has forwarded a copy of the title deed on 17 November 2019 stating that the land express condition is for commercial purposes. Hence, the Condition has been complied with in respect of this station as Gas Malaysia is currently supplying to commercial customers i.e Hilton Hotel, Le Meridian Hotel, St Regis Hotel and Suasana Sentral.

(d) District station located at Tampoi Industrial Estate, Johor Bahru:

Terminated and dismantled on 12 December 2019 following the customer's decision to cease the operations.

Terminated and fully dismantled subsequent to the commissioning of a newly constructed district station in Tangga Batu Industrial area on 28 April 2021.

(f) District station located at Tebrau IV, Tebrau Industrial Estate:

A certified true copy of the title deed dated 8 April 2014 has been provided by the landlord, stating that the land express condition is for medium industrial purposes. Hence, the Condition has been complied with in respect of this station as this station is currently supplying gas to industrial factories within the vicinity.

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# Our opinion

In our opinion, the financial statements of Gas Malaysia Berhad ("the Company") and its subsidiaries ("the Group") give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and of the Company as at 31 December 2024, and of their financial performance and their cash flows for the financial year then ended in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.

# What we have audited

We have audited the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, which comprise the statements of financial position as at 31 December 2024 of the Group and of the Company, and the statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows of the Group and of the Company for the financial year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of material accounting policies, as set out on pages 132 to 195.

# Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the "Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements" section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

# Independence and other ethical responsibilities

We are independent of the Group and of the Company in accordance with the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, Conduct and Practice) of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants ("By-Laws") and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) ("IESBA Code"), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the By-Laws and the IESBA Code.

# Our audit approach

As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company. In particular, we considered where the Directors made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters, consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.

We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and of the Company, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group and the Company operate.

# Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

<table><tr><td>Key audit matter</td><td>How our audit addressed the key audit matter</td></tr><tr><td>Accrual for gas costs</td><td>We performed the following:</td></tr><tr><td>The Group recognised gas cost accrual of RM557.34 million as at 31 December 2024 as disclosed in Note 24 to the financial statements.As there is a timing difference between the supply of gas and the receipt of the actual billing from the gas supplier as at the end of the reporting period, the unbilled gas cost is accrued based on the gas volume supplied by its gas supplier to its gas network.Refer to Note 3(h)(ii), Note 5 and Note 24 to the financial statements.</td><td>We tested the design and operating effectiveness of management&#x27;s key controls on the comparison between the total customers&#x27; meter readings against the total natural gas supplied to determine the volume of gas supplied but had not been billed by the supplier as at the end of the reporting period.For billings that have been issued by the supplier and received by management subsequent to the reporting date, we traced these billings to the accruals recorded at the reporting date.For billings that have not been issued by the supplier subsequent to the reporting date, we tested the management&#x27;s computation of the gas volume consumed against the gas volume sold to the customers.We tested management&#x27;s steps to address the variances in gas volume above the threshold set by management, which is based on historical data for the gas losses in-transit between the supply pipeline and the pipeline connection at the customers&#x27; premises.We reviewed the gas supply agreements signed between the Group and the supplier, and reviewed the legal opinion by an external solicitor obtained in the prior year to ascertain the Group&#x27;s obligation in accruing the gas cost.Based on the procedures performed, there were no material exceptions.</td></tr></table>

We have determined that there are no key audit matters to report for the Company.

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

# Information other than the financial statements and auditors' report thereon

The Directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Directors’ Report, Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control and Audit Committee Report, which we obtained prior to the date of this auditors’ report, and Management Discussion and Analysis, Sustainability Report and Chairman’s Statement and the other sections of the 2024 annual report, which is expected to be made available to us after that date. Other information does not include the financial statements of the Group and of the Company and our auditors’ report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditors' report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of the Directors for the financial statements

The Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company that give a true and fair view in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

# Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

# Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements (continued)

As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

(a) Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.  
(b) Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's and of the Company's internal control.  
(c) Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors.  
(d) Conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's or on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.  
(e) Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.  
(f) Plan and perform the group audit to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business units within the Group as a basis for forming an opinion on the Group financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and review of the audit work performed for purposes of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

# Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements (continued)

We communicate with the Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

From the matters communicated with the Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# OTHER MATTERS

This report is made solely to the members of the Company, as a body, in accordance with Section 266 of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility to any other person for the content of this report.

# Notes to the Financial Statements

For The Financial Year Ended 31 December 2024

# 1 GENERAL INFORMATION

The principal activities of the Company are the provision of management services and investment holdings activities. Details of the principal activities of the subsidiaries and joint ventures are set out in Notes 14 and 15 to the financial statements. There have been no significant changes in these principal activities during the financial year.

The Company is a public limited liability company, incorporated and domiciled in Malaysia.

The address of the registered office and the principal place of business of the Company is 5, Jalan Serendah 26/17, Seksyen 26, 40732 Shah Alam, Selangor Darul Ehsan.

The financial statements have been approved for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Board of Directors on 26 March 2025.

# 2 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES

The Group's and the Company's activities are exposed to a variety of financial risks, including profit rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group's and the Company's overall financial risk management objective is to ensure that the Group and the Company create value for the shareholders. Financial risk management is carried out through risk reviews, internal control systems, an insurance programme and adherence to Group's financial risk management policies.

# (a) Profit rate risk

The Group's and the Company's income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market profit rates. The profit rate exposure arises from the Group's and the Company's deposits and borrowings, and are not material to the operations of the Group and of the Company.

# Notes to the Financial Statements

For The Financial Year Ended 31 December 2024 (continued)

# 2 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# (b) Credit risk

# Risk management

The Group's and the Company's exposure to credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivable balances. The Company's exposure to credit risk arises from amounts due from subsidiaries and joint ventures. Risks arising therefrom are minimised through:

Performing regular reviews of the aging profiles of amounts due from subsidiaries and joint ventures.  
- Investing cash assets safely and profitably, which involves placement of cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits with established banks or financial institutions. In addition, the Group and the Company set exposure limits as well as limiting placement tenures to less than one year for each of the financial institutions.  
Performing credit evaluations on customers and assessing the credit quality of the customers by taking into account their financial positions, past experience and other factors.  
- Ensuring the collection risk arising from trade receivables is minimised by imposing a requirement for a 2-month or 3-month financial guarantee on its customers. A credit review committee meets regularly and closely monitors the trade receivables.

# Measurement of Expected Credit Loss ("ECL")

The Group and the Company set out three categories of receivables that reflect their credit risks and loss allowance is determined for these categories.

# (i) Trade receivables using simplified approach

The Group and the Company classify their trade receivables by nature of the customer accounts i.e. active accounts and terminated accounts. In determining the expected loss rates, the Group and the Company take into consideration the following:

- The collection of a 2-month or 3-month financial guarantee (e.g. collection in the form of cash deposits, issuance of bank guarantees by the customers in the name of the Group, etc.) from the customers prior to the commencement of supply of gas. These financial guarantees are reviewed periodically to ensure that the amounts remain appropriate vis-à-vis the value of the gas supplied or reserved firm capacity.  
- Issuance of suspension notice to the customers with payments past due 1 day from the credit terms for gas sales. Thereafter, customers are given a grace period of 7 days from the issuance of the suspension notice, and failure to make payments will entail the disconnection of gas supply to the customer's premise.  
- Issuance of suspension notice to the customers with payments past due 14 days from the credit terms for provision of tolling services. Thereafter, customers are given a grace period of 14 days from the issuance of the suspension notice, and failure to make payments will entail the disconnection of tolling services.

These, together with very low default rate, resulted in immaterial credit losses. No significant changes to estimation techniques or assumptions were made during the reporting period.

# 2 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# (b) Credit risk (continued)

Measurement of Expected Credit Loss ("ECL") (continued)

(i) Trade receivables using simplified approach (continued)

The Group's and the Company's maximum exposure to credit risk and loss allowance recognised as at the reporting date are disclosed in Note 17. The remaining amount for which no ECL allowance was recognised is deemed to be recoverable, with low probability of default.

Concentration of credit risk arises when a number of customers are engaged in similar business activities or activities within the same geographic region, or when they have similar risk characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. The Group continuously monitors its portfolios to identify and assess significant concentration of credit risk.

The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk in the current financial year arising from exposure to a single counterparty or a group of counterparties having similar risk characteristics. This is due to the Group's large number of customers and their wide geographical spread. The Group manages credit risk arising from trade and other receivables through credit quality evaluation, ongoing debt collection, regular monitoring of debtors' account and credit limits and accepting only appropriate bank guarantees (if applicable) issued by renowned financial institutions as well as collecting adequate cash deposits.

(ii) Debt instruments at amortised cost other than trade receivables, using the 3-stage general approach

The Group and the Company use four categories to reflect their credit risk and how the loss allowance is determined for each of the categories. A summary of the assumptions underpinning the Group's and the Company's expected credit loss is as follows:

<table><tr><td>Category</td><td>Definition of category</td><td>Basis of recognition of ECL provision</td></tr><tr><td>Performing</td><td>Debtors have a low risk of default and a strong capacity to meet the contractual cash flows.</td><td>12 months expected losses. Where the expected lifetime on an asset is less than 12 months, expected losses are measured at its expected lifetime.</td></tr><tr><td>Underperforming</td><td>Debtors for which there is a significant increase in credit risk due to actual or expected significant adverse changes in business, financial or economic conditions that are expected to cause a significant change to the debtor&#x27;s ability to meet its obligation.</td><td>Lifetime expected losses.</td></tr><tr><td>Non-performing</td><td>There is evidence indicating the assets is credit-impaired.</td><td>Lifetime expected losses.</td></tr><tr><td>Write-off</td><td>There is evidence indicating that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery based on unavailability of debtor&#x27;s sources of income or assets to generate sufficient future cash flows to repay the amount.</td><td>Asset is written-off.</td></tr></table>

Based on the above, loss allowance is measured on either 12-month ECL or lifetime ECL using a PD ("Probability of Default") x LGD ("Loss Given Default") x EAD ("Exposure at Default") methodology.

# (b) Credit risk (continued)

Measurement of Expected Credit Loss ("ECL") (continued)

(ii) Debt instruments at amortised cost other than trade receivables, using the 3-stage general approach (continued)

In deriving the PD and the LGD, the historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors (such as crude oil prices and gross domestic product growth) affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables. The historical loss rates will be adjusted based on expected changes in these factors. No significant changes to estimation techniques or assumptions were made during the reporting period.

For intercompany balances that are repayable on demand, the Company's ECL is based on the following assumptions:

- If the borrower has sufficient accessible highly liquid assets in order to repay the loan if demanded at the reporting date, the ECL is likely to be immaterial.  
- If the borrower could not repay the loan if demanded at the reporting date, the Company considers the expected manner of recovery to measure the ECL. The recovery manner could be either through 'repayment over time' or a fire sale of less liquid assets by the borrower.  
- If the recovery strategies indicate that the Company would fully recover the outstanding balance of the loan, the ECL would be limited to the effect of the discounting of the amount due on the loan, at the loan's effective interest rates, over the period until the amount is fully recovered.

All of the Group's and of the Company's debt instruments at amortised cost other than trade receivables are considered to have low credit risks, as these were considered to be performing, have low risks of default and historically there were minimal instances where contractual cash flow obligations have not been met.

The maximum exposure to credit risks for debt instruments at amortised cost other than trade receivables are represented by the carrying amounts recognised in the statements of financial position.

# (iii) Financial guarantee contracts

The Company has issued the Kafalah guarantee to a bank for Sukuk Murabahah Programme ("SMP") granted to its subsidiary, as disclosed in Note 25.

The Company is exposed to credit risk arising from the financial guarantee contract given to the bank for its subsidiary's borrowings where the maximum credit risk exposure is the amount of the borrowings utilised by the subsidiary. The Company believes that the financial guarantee contract is considered to be performing, has low risk of default and is unlikely to be called upon by the subsidiary's bank. Accordingly, no loss allowance was identified based on 12 months ECL.

Sukuk Murakah Programmes</td><td>431,520</td><td>330,191</td></tr></table>

Information regarding trade and other receivables that are neither past due nor impaired is disclosed in Note 17.

Credit risk from cash and cash equivalents is managed on a group basis. Only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of "A" as assessed by reference to RAM Rating Services Berhad are accepted.

Deposits with banks are neither past due nor impaired and have no history of default.

# (c) Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and ensuring the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities.

Whilst the Group's and the Company's current liabilities exceeded their current assets by RM67,669,000 (2023: RM156,083,000) and RM142,379,000 (2023: RM176,638,000) respectively, the Directors are of the view that the Group and the Company are able to meet their obligations based on the cash flow forecast of the Group and of the Company for the next twelve months from the reporting date. In addition, the Group and the Company have undrawn committed borrowing facilities of RM670,000,000 (2023: RM870,000,000) as at 31 December 2024.

At the Company level, the future dividend distribution from its subsidiaries are expected to alleviate the liquidity position of the Company.

# (d) Capital management

The Group's and the Company's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern while seeking to maximise benefits to shareholders and other stakeholders.

The Group and the Company actively and regularly review and manage their capital structure to ensure optimal capital structure and shareholder returns, taking into consideration the future capital requirements of the Group and the Company, prevailing and projected profitability, projected operating cash flows, projected capital expenditure and projected strategic investment opportunities. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders. The Company targets a dividend ratio of not less than  $75\%$  of profit after tax.

The Group monitors capital utilisation based on the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total capital. Total debt is calculated as total borrowings (comprising short term and long term borrowings as well as lease liabilities as shown in the statements of financial position). Total capital is calculated as the sum of total equity and total debt.

The gearing ratios as at the reporting date are as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">Group</td></tr><tr><td>2024 RM&#x27;000</td><td>2023 RM&#x27;000</td></tr><tr><td>Total debt</td><td>435,338</td><td>333,643</td></tr><tr><td>Total equity</td><td>1,506,169</td><td>1,367,875</td></tr><tr><td>Total capital</td><td>1,941,507</td><td>1,701,518</td></tr><tr><td>Gearing ratio</td><td>22.4%</td><td>19.6%</td></tr></table>

There were no changes in the Group's approach to capital management during the current financial year. The Group maintains a debt to equity ratio that complied with the debt covenants in respect of the borrowings undertaken by the Group.

# (e) Fair value hierarchy

The assets and liabilities carried at fair value are categorised into different levels of fair value hierarchy as follows:

Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived prices).  
Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs).

The carrying amounts of all financial assets and liabilities of the Group and of the Company at the end of the reporting period approximated their fair values.

(i) There was no financial asset measured and recognised at fair value during the financial year.  
(ii) There were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 of the fair value hierarchy during the financial years.  
(iii) There were no transfers into and out of level 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the financial years.

# 3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Unless otherwise stated, the following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items that are considered material in relation to the financial statements.

# (a) Basis of preparation

The financial statements of the Group and the Company have been prepared in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards ("MFRS"), International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except as disclosed in this summary of material accounting policies.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with MFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. It also requires Directors to exercise their judgement in the process of applying the Group and the Company's accounting policies. Although these estimates and judgement are based on the Directors' best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may differ. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are material to the financial statements are disclosed in Note 3(h).

# 3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# (a) Basis of preparation (continued)

(i) Standards, amendments to published standards and interpretations that are effective and relevant to the Group and the Company:

The Group and the Company has applied the following amendments and annual improvements to published standards for the first time for the financial year beginning on 1 January 2024:

- Amendment to MFRS 101 'Classification of liabilities as current or non-current' and 'Non-current Liabilities with Covenants.

The Group applied the amendments retrospectively, which did not result in a change in the classification of the Group's borrowings.

- Amendments to MFRS 16 'Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback'

The adoption of amendments listed above did not have any impact on the amounts recognised in prior periods and are not expected to significantly affect the current or future periods.

(ii) Standards early adopted by the Group and the Company

There were no standards early adopted by the Group and by the Company.

(iii) Amendments to published standards that are applicable to the Group and the Company but not yet effective and have not been adopted by the Group and by the Company.

A number of amendments to published standards are effective for the financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2025. The Group and the Company intends to adopt the following pronouncements that are applicable to the Group and the Company when they become effective:

Effective for financial year beginning on or after 1 January 2025

- Amendments to MFRS 121 "The effect of changes in Foreign Exchange Rates" on "Lack of exchangeability"

The amendment specifies on assessment to determine whether a currency is exchangeable into another currency or not. When a currency is not exchangeable into another currency, the spot exchange rate needs to be estimated. The objective in estimating the spot exchange rate at a measurement date is to determine the rate at which an orderly exchange transaction would take place at that date between market participants under prevailing economic conditions.

A framework is set out to estimate the spot exchange rate when exchangeability is lacking.

The amendments include accompanying new disclosures to help investors to understand the effects, risks and estimated rates and techniques used when a currency is not exchangeable.

Effective for financial year beginning on or after 1 January 2026

- Amendments to MFRS 9 and MFRS 7 'Amendments to the Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments have:

(i) require financial assets to be derecognised on the date the contractual rights to the cash flows expire and financial liabilities to be derecognised when obligation under the contract is discharged (i.e. the settlement date).

(iii) Amendments to published standards that are applicable to the Group and the Company but not yet effective and have not been adopted by the Group and by the Company (continued)

A number of amendments to published standards are effective for the financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2027. The Group and the Company intend to adopt the following pronouncements that are applicable to the Group and the Company when they become effective: (continued)

Effective for financial year beginning on or after 1 January 2027

- MFRS 18 'Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements' replaces MFRS 101 'Presentation of Financial Statements'.

The new MFRS introduces a new structure of profit or loss statement.

(a) Income and expenses are classified into 3 new main categories:

i. Operating category which typically includes results from the main business activities;

ii. Investing category that presents the results of investments in associates and joint ventures and other assets that generate a return largely independently of other resources; and

iii. Financing category that presents income and expenses from financing liabilities.

(b) Entities are required to present two new specified subtotals: 'Operating profit or loss' and 'Profit or loss before financing and income taxes'.

Management-defined performance measures ('MPMs') are disclosed in a single note and reconciled to the most similar specified subtotal in MFRS Accounting Standards.  
Changes to the guidance on aggregation and disaggregation which focus on grouping items based on their shared characteristics.

MFRS 19 "Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures"

MFRS 19 is an optional, disclosure-only Standard which permits eligible subsidiaries to provide reduced disclosures when applying MFRS Accounting Standards in their financial statements. The eligible subsidiary that applies MFRS 19 is required to apply the requirements in the other MFRS Accounting Standards for recognition, measurement and presentation requirements. Subsidiaries are eligible to apply MFRS 19 if they do have public accountability and their parent company applies IFRS Accounting Standards in their consolidated financial statements. A subsidiary does not have public accountability if it does not have equities or debt listed in a public market (or is in the process of issuing such instruments for trading in a public market) or does not hold assets in a fiduciary capacity for a broad group of outsiders.

# 3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

(iii) Amendments to published standards that are applicable to the Group and the Company but not yet effective and have not been adopted by the Group and by the Company (continued)

The Group and the Company intend to adopt the following pronouncements that are applicable to the Group and the Company when they become effective:

Effective date yet to be determined by the Malaysian Accounting Standards Board

- Amendments to MFRS 10 "Consolidated Financial Statements" and MFRS 128 "Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures" on Sales or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture resolve a current inconsistency between MFRS 10 and MFRS 128.

The accounting treatment depends on whether the non-monetary assets sold or contributed to an associate or joint venture constitute a "business".

Full gain or loss shall be recognised by the investor where the non-monetary assets constitute a "business". If the assets do not meet the definition of a business, the gain or loss is recognised by the investor to the extent of the other investors' interests. In other words, the elimination of profits or losses resulting from "upstream" and "downstream" transactions between an investor and its associate or a joint venture rule is only applicable if the asset is not a business.

The amendments will only apply when an investor sells or contributes assets to its associate or joint venture. They are not intended to address accounting for the sale or contribution of assets by an investor in joint operation.

There is not expected to be any material impact to the financial statements of the Group and the Company arising from the amendments to published standards that are applicable, but yet to be effective, except for presentation of the financial statements.

# (b) Functional and presentation currency

Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group's and of the Company's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the "functional currency"). The financial statements of the Group and of the Company are presented in Ringgit Malaysia, which is the Company's functional and presentation currency.

# 3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# (c) Financial instruments

# (i) Financial guarantee contracts

Financial guarantee contracts are contracts that require the Company to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due, in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument.

Financial guarantee contracts are recognised as a financial liability at the time the guarantee is issued. The liability is initially measured at fair value.

The fair value of financial guarantees is determined based on the present value of the difference in cash flows between the contractual payments required under the debt instrument and the payments that would be required without the guarantee, or the estimated amount that would be payable to a third party for assuming the obligations.

Financial guarantee contracts are subsequently measured at the higher of the amount determined in accordance with the expected credit loss model under MFRS 9 "Financial Instruments" and the amount initially recognised less cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the principles of MFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers', where appropriate.

# (d) Derivatives and hedging activities

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value at the end of each reporting period.

The accounting for subsequent changes in fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are classified as held for trading and accounted for at fair value through profit or loss. Changes in the fair value are recognised immediately in profit or loss and are included in other gains/(losses). Derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting are designated as either:

(i) Hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment (fair value hedge);  
(ii) Hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge); or  
(iii) Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge).

The Group documents at the inception of the hedge relationship, the economic relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items including whether changes in the cash flows of the hedging instruments are expected to offset changes in the cash flows of hedged items. The Group documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking its hedge transactions.

# Notes to the Financial Statements

# For The Financial Year Ended 31 December 2024 (continued)

# 3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# (d) Derivatives and hedging activities (continued)

Cash flow hedge

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in reserves within equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss within other gains/(losses).

Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss. The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of interest rate swaps hedging variable rate borrowings is recognised in profit or loss within finance income/cost at the same time as the interest expense on the hedged borrowings.

When the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset (for example, inventory or property, plant and equipment), the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are reclassified from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset. The deferred amounts are ultimately recognised in cost of goods sold in the case of inventory or in depreciation in the case of property, plant and equipment.

When a hedging instrument expires or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the accounting of any cumulative deferred gain or loss and deferred cost of hedging included in equity depends on the nature of the underlying hedged transaction. For cash flow hedge which resulted in the recognition of a non-financial asset, the cumulative amount in equity shall be included in the initial cost of the asset. For other cash flow hedges, the cumulative amount in equity is reclassified to profit or loss in the same period that the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss. When hedged future cash flows or forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss and deferred cost of hedging that was reported in equity is immediately reclassified to profit or loss within other gains/(losses).

The Group applies the reliefs provided by Phase 1 amendments related to IBOR reform for the hedging instruments used in the Group's hedging strategies which reference IBOR and have not yet transitioned to an alternative benchmark rate. The Group ceases to apply the reliefs provided by the Phase 1 amendments at the earlier of (a) when there is no longer uncertainty arising from IBOR reform over the timing and amount of the IBOR-linked cash flows of the hedged item, and (b) when the hedging relationship to which the reliefs are applied is discontinued.

# (a) Hedge designation

When the Phase 1 amendments cease to apply, the Group will amend its hedge designation to reflect changes which are required by IBOR reform, but only to make one or more of the following changes:

(i) designating an alternative benchmark rate (contractually or non-contractually specified) as a hedged risk;  
(ii) amending the description of the hedged item, including the description of the designated portion of the cash flows or fair value being hedged; or  
(iii) amending the description of the hedging instrument.

The Group will amend its hedge documentation to reflect this change in designation by the end of the reporting period in which the changes are made. These amendments to the hedge documentation do not require the Group to discontinue its hedge relationships.

# 3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# (d) Derivatives and hedging activities (continued)

(b) Amounts accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve

When the Group amends its hedge designation as described above, the accumulated amount outstanding in the cash flow hedge reserve is deemed to be based on the alternative benchmark rate. For discontinued hedging relationships, when the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged future cash flows were based has changed as required by IBOR reform, the amount accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve is also deemed to be based on the alternative benchmark rate for the purpose of assessing whether the hedged future cash flows are still expected to occur.

# (e) Income recognition

Revenue from contracts with customers

(i) Sale of gas

The Group's revenue is mainly derived from the sales of natural gas to industrial, commercial and residential customers. The Group sell gas to the customers in various forms, namely natural gas, CNG and LPG.

As part of the customer's process to obtain gas supply from the Group, customers may be required to pay a connectivity charge to the Group (i.e. payment of capital contribution in order for the Group to connect the customer's premise to the natural gas distribution system ("NGDS") network). In the case of the Group, as the connectivity charge and the supply of gas are highly interdependent on one another to produce the output that the customer requires (i.e. the supply of gas), it is therefore not being capable to be distinct in the context of the supply of goods and services, and is treated as one single performance obligation.

Revenue from gas sales is recognised (net of discount and taxes collected on behalf) as and when the Group's customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits (i.e. the customers are able to utilise the gas for their benefit as and when the gas is being supplied) arising from the Group performing their obligations based on the terms of the contracts with the customers. Accordingly, revenue from the supply of gas is recognised over time, i.e. as and when the gas supplied is consumed by the customers. There is no element of financing present as the Group's sales are based on a credit term of 30 days from the date of the invoice.

a) Provision for tolling services

Revenue from provision of tolling services is recognised in the period in which the tolling activities are performed. There is no element of financing present as sales is based on a credit term of 22 to 24 days from the date of invoice.

b) Provision for metered services

Revenue from metered services comprise charges imposed to retail license holders, who are also the customers of the Group, in respect of billing and payment collection services provided on behalf of the retail license holders to the respective customers. It is recognised in the period in which the activities are performed. There is no element of financing present as sales is based on a credit term of 30 days from the date of invoice.

c) Fee from management services

Fee from management services is recognised as revenue over time during the period in which the services are rendered.

# 3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# (e) Income recognition (continued)

Revenue from other source

(i) Dividend income

Dividend income is recognised when the Group's and the Company's right to receive payment is established.

# (f) Property, plant and equipment

(i) Depreciation

Freehold land is not depreciated as it has an indefinite life. Depreciation on capital work-in-progress commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.

Other property, plant and equipment are depreciated on the straight-line method to allocate the cost to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, summarised as follows:

Buildings 50 years

Motor vehicles 5 years

Office and gas equipment 3 to 5 years

Furniture and fittings 5 years

Office renovation 3 years

Pipeline and distribution systems 10 to 30 years

# (g) Share capital

(i) Classification

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Other shares are classified as equity and/or liability according to the economic substance of the particular instrument.

(ii) Dividend distribution

Liability is recognised for the amount of any dividend declared, being appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of the Group, on or before the end of the reporting period but not distributed at the end of the reporting period.

For The Financial Year Ended 31 December 2024 (continued)

# 3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# (h) Critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements

Estimates and judgements are continually being evaluated by the Directors and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

# (i) Depreciation policy

The depreciation policy of the pipelines system adopted by the Directors, assumes that there are no changes expected to the technology and legal environment in the industry in which the Group operates in, as well as the manner of which the assets are being used. In addition, given the significance of the pipeline network used to supply gas to the end customers, the Group has competitive advantage as it would be difficult for any new entrant to replicate, and therefore the current useful life continues to be reasonable.

Estimates and judgements are continuously evaluated by the Directors and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the technology and legal environment in the industry in which the Group operates in, as well as the manner of which the assets are being used could impact the economic useful lives and the residual values of these assets. Therefore, future depreciation charges could be revised if there is an increase in economic useful lives of the pipelines systems.

The Group's carrying amount of the property, plant and equipment as at 31 December 2024 will be increased by approximately RM10,282,000 if the useful lives of the pipelines system that are reaching the end of their useful lives are extended from 30 years to 40 years.

# (ii) Accrual for gas costs

The Directors have also taken into account the terms of business which the Group has with its gas suppliers where the title and ownership of the gas shall be transferred to the Group upon delivery of gas to the Group's pipeline. Any change in the customers' consumption patterns and the terms of business which the Group has with its gas suppliers will have an effect on the accrual for gas costs.

# 3 SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

# (h) Critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements (continued)

(iii) Revenue recognition arising from the Group's rights and obligations under the Incentive-Based Regulation ("IBR") and Third Party Access ("TPA")

The Directors have applied judgement in applying the revenue recognition policy based on the Group's business model, its relationships and contracts with the customers and its rights and obligations under the IBR and TPA. The judgement includes the assessment of the Group's rights in dealing with and charging the customers, taking into consideration the Group's responsibility for securing and expanding their customer base and bearing the credit risk of the customers.

The Energy Commission ("EC") implemented the TPA on 1 January 2020, which entails the liberalisation of the Malaysian gas market whereby third parties are expected to be involved in the retailing of gas to end customers. IBR allows the distribution licensee (i.e. Gas Malaysia Distribution Sdn. Bhd.) or the EC to propose additional components for revenue adjustment. These adjustments are used by the EC to ensure that the Group is able to pass through the variances arising from the estimated and actual approved components.

Under this mechanism, the Group's claims and undertakings are such that any variances between actual and approved components allowed under the IBR mechanism used in the determination of tariff rates for the utilisation of the Natural Gas Distribution System ("NGDS") would be payable to or reimbursable from the Government via annual adjustments to the distribution tariff. The variance would be recognised as part of revenue in the period when the variances occur.

The Directors have considered the Group's rights and obligations with the customers and the Government under the IBR and TPA in determining the revenue recognition for the financial year as well as the recovery of the outstanding balance as at the reporting date. Any change to the actual against approved submitted forecast by the EC will impact the revenue recognised and the recovery of the outstanding balance. Refer to Note 17 to the financial statements for further details.

See Note 3(h)(iii) for the rights and obligations of the Group under the IBR framework and TPA.

These relate to a number of independent customers for whom there is no history of default. The aging analysis of these trade receivables (excluding other receivables) are as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">Group</td><td colspan="2">Company</td></tr><tr><td>2024

Trade receivables that are neither past due nor impaired mainly relate to industrial users, which are nationally dispersed and covers a spectrum of industries with a variety of end markets and have high credit worthiness. As described in Note 2(b), the Group requires the customers to pledge a bank guarantee or place cash deposit as collateral. Trade receivables of the Group are secured by bank guarantees and customers' deposits of RM1,492,637,000 (2023: RM1,598,274,000) and RM84,539,000 (2023: RM78,298,000) respectively. Due to these factors, the Group's and the Company's historical experience shows that the impairment loss allowance on trade receivables has been adequate.

As at 31 December 2024, trade receivables amounting to RM11,249,000 (2023: RM11,323,000) for the Group and RM6,478,000 (2023: RM6,478,000) for the Company were impaired and provided for. The individually impaired receivables mainly relate to customers which have defaulted in payment.

# 22 DEFERRED TAXATION (CONTINUED)

Subject to the agreement of the Inland Revenue Board of Malaysia, the estimated amount of deferred tax assets calculated at the current tax rate which have not been recognised in the Group's financial statements, as the Directors are of the view that it is not probable that sufficient future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences and tax losses can be utilised, are as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan="3"></td><td colspan="2">Group</td></tr><tr><td>2024</td><td>2023</td></tr><tr><td>RM&#x27;000</td><td>RM&#x27;000</td></tr><tr><td>No expiry period:</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>- Unabsorbed capital allowances</td><td>7,208</td><td>6,689</td></tr><tr><td>- Other deductible temporary differences</td><td>366</td><td>461</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>7,574</td><td>7,150</td></tr><tr><td>Unutilised tax losses expiring in the following financial years:</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>- 2028</td><td>3,799</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>- 2029</td><td>690</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>- 2030</td><td>613</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>- 2033</td><td>837</td><td>837</td></tr><tr><td>- 2034</td><td>246</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>13,759</td><td>7,987</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>3,302</td><td>1,917</td></tr></table>

Under the Malaysia Finance Act 2023 which was gazetted on 31 December 2021, the existing time limit to carry forward unutilised tax losses has been extended to 10 consecutive years of assessment. Accordingly, any accumulated unutilised tax losses brought forward from year of assessment 2018 and thereafter can be carried forward for 10 consecutive years of assessment.

Capital contribution received from customers is considered as part of the process to obtain gas supply from the Group and therefore, it is considered as one performance obligation. The capital contribution received from the customer will be accounted for as a contract liability which will be recognised as revenue over the contract of the gas supply with the customers.

The Group's operation is in Malaysia. The chief operating decision-maker, which consists of members of the Management Committee consider that the Group's business consists of two operating segments.

The Board assesses the performance of the operating segment based on a measure of earnings before finance income, finance cost, zakat, taxation, depreciation and amortisation.

Segment assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets, trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents, and exclude investments in joint ventures, deferred tax assets and tax recoverable.

Segment liabilities comprise trade and other payables, contract liabilities, borrowings and lease liabilities, and exclude tax payable and deferred tax liabilities.

# Notice of  $34^{\text{th}}$  Annual General Meeting

# EXPLANATORY NOTES:

A. Tan Sri Wan Zulkifleean and Datuk Syed Abu Bakar S Mohsin Almohdzar ("the Retiring Director" or collectively "the Retiring Directors") are standing for re-election as Directors of the Company and have offered themselves for re-election. For the purpose of determining eligibility of the Retiring Directors, the Board has considered the results of the Board evaluation conducted for the year 2024. The Retiring Directors met the performance criteria required of an effective and high-performance Board based on the results. Therefore, the Board is recommending the re-election of the Retiring Directors for the shareholders' approval.

The NRC had assessed the Retiring Directors and supports the re-appointment of the Retiring Directors based on the following:

(i) The Retiring Directors understand their roles and responsibilities and are committed in discharging their fiduciary duties, have sound knowledge and understanding of the Company's business and challenges as well as the industry in which the Company operates and able to chart strategic direction of the Company;  
(ii) Their valuable skills, extensive experience and ability to contribute to the constructive deliberations at the Board/Board Committee meetings; and  
(iii) Satisfactory assessment of their fitness and propriety in regard to the Fit and Proper Policy of the Company.

The profile of the retiring Directors are set out on pages 72 and 76 of the Annual Report.

B. Clause 107 of the Company's Constitution provides that any director appointed to fill a casual vacancy shall retire at the next following AGM and shall be eligible for re-election. Encik Atsunori Takeuchi, who was appointed on 1 June 2024 will be seeking re-election under Clause 107 of the Company's Constitution. Therefore, the Board is recommending the re-election of Encik Atsunori Takeuchi for the shareholders' approval.

His profile is set out on page 74 of the Annual Report.

C. Section 230(1) of the Act provides amongst others, that the fees of the directors and any benefits payable to the directors of a listed company and its subsidiaries shall be approved at a general meeting. In this respect, the Board agreed that the shareholders' approval shall be sought at the  $34^{\text{th}}$  AGM on the Directors' remuneration as follows:

Ordinary Resolution 4 on payment of Directors' fees and any benefits payable to the Directors in respect of period commencing from 30 May 2025 to the next AGM of the Company tentatively to be held in May 2026.
