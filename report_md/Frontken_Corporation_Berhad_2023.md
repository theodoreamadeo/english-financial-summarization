* The earning per share have been adjusted to reflect the bonus issue of two for every one existing ordinary share which was completed on 30 April 2021.  
The Group has not issued any dilutive potential ordinary shares and hence, the diluted earnings per share is equal to the basic earnings per share.  
The potential conversion of warrants is anti-dilutive as its exercise price is higher than the average market price of the Company's ordinary shares during the current financial period and hence, the diluted earnings per share is equal to the basic earnings per share.

# Dear Shareholders,

On behalf of the Board of Directors (the "Board"), I'm pleased to present to you the Annual Report and Audited Financial Statements of the Group for the financial year 2023 ("FY2023"). As part of this Annual Report, we have also included the Management Discussion and Analysis to provide our shareholders with a more insightful and informative details of the Group's operation and performance.

Despite a challenging operating environment, our business continued to demonstrate incredible resilience, thanks to our strong fundamentals and team of dedicated employees. It is a testament to our solid foundation, careful planning, and our flexibility to adapt to the rapidly changing business landscape.

# MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

# FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

This is the first time in many years that we have not reported a growth in both our revenue and earnings. Nonetheless, the result is still a commendable one considering the overall weakness in the main segment that we operate in. The revenue for 2023 was RM500.1 million, a slight decrease of  $3\%$  compared to last year due to lower contribution from all our subsidiaries except for the ones in Malaysia and the Philippines.

The Group's profit before tax for the year was at RM167.1 million, a  $4\%$  decrease from the preceding financial year. Our earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation ("EBITDA") stood at RM188.4 million. Our profit after tax ("PAT") was RM124.3 million, a decrease of  $8\%$  compared to RM135.2 million recorded a year ago.

During the year, the Group continued to generate a positive cash flow of RM144.0 million from our business operations. The Group's capital expenditure ("CAPEX") for the year for property, plant and equipment was at RM15.2 million. Despite the cash outflows from dividend and CAPEX, the Group's total cash balance as at 31 December 2023 remained strong at RM417.0 million. The Group's financial position at the end of FY2023 continued to be strong with total assets standing at RM885.4 million, an increase of  $10\%$  compared to the previous year.

We will endeavour to pay a sustainable dividend and return profits to shareholders that commensurate with the performance of the Group. In 2024, the Company declared a dividend of 2.2 sen per share amounting to RM34.6 million. We believe that we will be able to continue with a sustainable dividend payment, taking into consideration our financial performance, capital commitments, acquisition related activities and reserves, among others.

# CHAIRMAN'SMESSAGE (CONT'D)

# OVERALL 2023

The main challenge facing the Group's operations last year was the overall weakness in global demand in the front end semiconductor industry. This was especially the case for our semiconductor segment in the first half of the year where activities were sluggish. To that end, the Group took various measures to safeguard its profitability, namely managing its costs and at the same time continue to explore new opportunities. The Group's engineering business, on the other hand, performed very well with a record breaking bottom line. This is a classic case of perseverance paying off in the long run.

We continued to hold our annual executive team meetings where we reviewed the individual unit's performances, exchanged ideas and set goals for the coming years. We set out business strategies and plans for each business unit according to their strengths, opportunities and market conditions. During the year, we also worked on exiting the non-strategic business such as our operation in Indonesia. It is still a work in progress and announcement, where necessary, will be made in due course.

# OUR WORKFORCE

We believe we are where we are today due to our amazing team. We place strong emphasis on developing and bringing out the best in our employees. During the year, we continued to encourage our employees to acquire new knowledge through continuous learning to enable them to stay on top of the industry trends and continue to be the leader in the space we operate in. Various trainings, seminars, workshops, and networking activities were conducted to allow our employees to have the opportunities to learn and master new skills set.

As always, we aim to be an employer of choice. To that end, we will continue to invest in our people through various performance-based incentives, competitive benefits and skills development programmes that allow for advancement opportunities within the Group. Every year, we will look into our employees' compensation package and make adjustments to reflect their achievements and contribution based on meeting the key performance indicators that include both qualitative and quantitative measures. We believe that it is vital to ensure that all our employees are compensated fairly for their skills and hard work and at the same time be in line with the current market standards.

# ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCE ("ESG") AND SUSTAINABILITY

ESG is an integral part of our company's culture and strategy. We are focused on making a positive and sustainable impact wherever we are at, from the Board and the leadership team, across all our businesses and at all levels of our workforce. We strongly believe that acting responsibly and with integrity is the only way to build and manage a business over the long term.

Environment – We are constantly looking at ways to further improve and see how we can make positive impact to the planet. Our strategy is underpinned by various sustainability goals and targets that will enable us to measure our progress toward reaching our vision. We have been working with our customers in addressing the environmental challenges, including the transition to a net zero carbon economy. Our research and development ("R&D") team continued to focus on where we can improve and deliver solutions that maximise benefits to the environment and society.

During the year, we continue to measure and look at ways where we can reduce greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions associated with our operation. We strive to minimise energy consumption in our workplace and at the same time improve on our operational performance in the areas of GHG emissions and energy, waste and water usage. In 2023, through our efforts and continued collaboration with our customers, since 2018, we have adopted the equivalent of 3,183,631 KW of electricity using solar energy, an accumulative savings of 394,517 tons of recycled DI-water, and accumulative savings of 460,807 kg of recycled waste in our operations. We have also set a long-term target of reducing our Emissions Intensity – to stabilise emissions with the aim to achieve Net Zero Emissions by 2050.

For more details specifically on our environment and climate change efforts, please visit our website at www.frontken.com for the report titled "Frontken Sustainability Climate Change Report 2023".

Social – We believe it is important that we give back to the community we live in and step up for them when they needed our support. We did this through various initiatives over the last years. For example, we believe that by helping and cultivating our younger generations/interns from various backgrounds as well as hiring underprivileged persons will help them to be independent and at the same time allows them to be self-sufficient and to have equal opportunities in the society. Additionally, our employees actively participate in activities such as blood donation drives and support for vulnerable and less privileged groups.

Over the years, we continued to foster staff wellness and development, maintain safe workplace, promote inclusion and equality, provide equal opportunities, encourage training and support retention of our talented people, among others. We believe by creating a happy workplace and good morale will in turn boost productivity as a whole. In 2023, we recorded an employee retention rate of  $98\%$ , achieving  $103\%$  of our target goal.

During the year, we continued our engagement with suppliers, customers and other stakeholders. We ensure that we provide our customers with the best services and good selling practices.

Governance – The Board is responsible, among other things, for reviewing the Group's strategy, its risk management and ensuring that there is a proper system of internal control in place. In the past few years, the Board had also discussed and established plans in the succession of the leadership team. We have a strong and stable Board consisting of Directors with a wide range of relevant knowledge, skills and experience, as more particularly set out in our Annual Report pages 20 to 22.

In addition, we actively engage with our shareholders through investor days, conferences and meetings in different locations around the world. These interactions with our potential shareholders and existing shareholders throughout the year provide us with valuable insights and help us refine our strategic priorities and our ESG goals.

More information on our Governance can be found in the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Report 2023.

Further details on the Group's Sustainability initiatives and achievements for FY2023 are available at the Sustainability section of this Annual Report and the full report on our website at www.frontken.com.

As announced by the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), the global semiconductor industry sales totalled \(526.8 billion in 2023, a decrease of \(8.2\%\) compared to the 2022 total of \(\$ 574.1\)billion, which was the industry’s highest ever annual total. As a result, demand for our semiconductor’s services also weakened slightly. We saw the overall industry to be relatively subdued during the first half of the year, and only gradually gained momentum towards the second half. Nevertheless, despite facing an ongoing volatile and weak business landscape, we managed to overcome these hurdles by tapping into our strong fundamentals and sturdy balance sheet. As indicated in my statement last year, we took the opportunity to work on new projects and fine tuning our operations during the slower period in anticipation of busier years to come.

As the nodes get smaller and the process of making chips become exponentially harder, so too are our cleaning processes and technology to cater to these developments. The cleaning requirement for the chamber process parts has become more and more stringent, hence the need to achieve close to zero particle contamination has become more crucial than ever - even a single speck of dust could be damaging to our customers' production. Therefore, our ultra-high purity advanced precision cleaning process is highly precise to ensure that the end result is of the highest quality to meet, in most instances exceed, our customers' specifications. To ensure that we comply with our customers' requirements, the cleaned parts are measured using the most advanced metrology systems and computerised data station. During the year, our R&D team continued to work closely alongside our customers to support them as they continue to advance in the leading-edge semiconductor technology. We are constantly exploring new ideas or improve those that already exist, especially in the area of ESG, where we utilise more environmentally friendly materials and automate some aspect of our processes.

Other than growing organically, the Group continues to look for opportunities and possibilities such as potential mergers and acquisitions in the semiconductor space. We will keep our shareholders updated through our Company's announcement should any of our endeavours materialise.

As reported by World Semiconductor Trade Statistics ("WSTS"), the contraction in 2023 is to be followed by a robust recovery, with an estimated growth of 13.1 percent in 2024<sup>1</sup>. Additionally, based on our conversations with our customers, we are cautiously optimistic that the performance of this segment will be more than satisfactory this year.

Taiwan – In FY2023, AGTC recorded a revenue of RM 327.8 million, a slight decrease of  $6\%$  compared to the previous year mainly due to a lower-than-expected semiconductors' fabs utilisation rate. We began to see a slow-down in activities by our customers early in the year. As such, during the start of the year, we took various measures such as reducing unnecessary spending, minimise expenses, optimising workforce, and focus on fostering strong relationships with customers and suppliers. There were no easy solutions, but we did not waver and continue to not only deliver on short-term expectations, but focus on our long-term goals leveraging on our strength and capabilities. Our hard work paid off early this year when our customer qualified us for a few key projects that we have been working with them for the past 12 to 18 months. These projects, we believe will contribute positively to the Group's performance.

For Plant 2, we are making good progress and have already started with the new advanced cleaning technology that was mentioned in my statement last year. We believe that Plant 2 will allow us to gain efficiency improvement in the long run and at the same time strengthen our position as the leading advanced high precision chamber parts service provider in the region for many years to come.

Our strategy has always been to invest for long-term sustainable growth. To that end, we will continue to look for new land for future expansion should Plant 2 runs out of capacity.

Frontken Singapore (Semicon) - The ongoing semiconductor slowdown, exacerbated further by rising manpower and material costs and limited pool of local talent has had quite a big impact to our business.

To mitigate the situation, we renegotiated some of our contracts with our customers to adjust prices for certain parts so that the same may be more aligned with the increased cost that we have been absorbing since the start of the pandemic. We are grateful to our customers for understanding our plights and agreeing to our proposed price re-alignment that will take place this year. We have also made considerable efforts such as streamlining our workforce, optimising our processes, and initiating continuous improvement projects to help boost profitability of this business unit.

Based on some of the preliminary feedback from our customers, we expect business to pick up gradually from the second half of 2024 underpinned by higher utilisation rate of their new fabs in Singapore.

# CHAIRMAN'SMESSAGE (CONT'D)

Frontken Malaysia ("FMSB") - Our precision cleaning business in Malaysia comes under FMSB which operates in Kulim, Melaka and Kuching. FMSB was not spared from the downturn in the semiconductor industry. In the face of these challenges, we remain focused in navigating the same by finding ways to reduce operating costs, providing innovative solutions and adding value to our services. Having said that, the performance of FMSB improved marginally with better revenue and bottom line compared to a year ago. The improved bottom lines was mainly due to continual cost saving efforts including identifying inefficiencies in production and streamlining our inventories.

Our foundry customer that are involved in the production of chips for the automotive segment are reportedly expanding their capacity to cater for the higher demand by their end customers. It was announced that they are investing billions of ringgits in Kulim Hi-Tech Park to increase their wide-bandgap chips production capacity. Consequently, we have also made the necessary investment to meet the expected additional demand from our customer and we will continue to do so should the need arises. We are excited with all these new developments which will augur well for our precision cleaning business in Malaysia.

# ENGINEERING DIVISION

In FY2023, our engineering divisions performance had been exceptional, with profits hitting record level in spite of the usual challenges in the oil and gas ("O&G") industry. Over the last decade, the O&G industry had experienced significant volatility alongside global geopolitical tensions. The COVID-19 pandemic has also plunged the global crude oil price into one of its lowest in recent years. Thankfully, our business gradually gained momentum in 2022 and 2023 as a result of improved activities in this segment which in turn contributes to a much-improved bottom line to our business in this segment.

With a mix of bullish and bearish views on O&G, we believe our business in this segment will continue to fluctuate depending on the market condition. However, with our many years of experience and our long-term strategy, we are cautiously optimistic, that this segment will continue to contribute positively to our Group's performance in the coming year.

TTES Frontken Integrated Services – Our business in this unit continued to do exceptionally well compared to the year before as we saw reduced disruptions to the supply chain as oil prices stabilise. Despite sales price pressures from customers and stiff competition, the continuous tweaking of TTES business strategies and selective investments throughout 2023 yielded their best ever performance in recent times.

Other than improved activities in Kemaman, we also saw increased orders flowing in at our facility in Pengerang, Johor. The facility was completed in 2022 to support the Petronas Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development (RAPID) and Pengerang Integrated Complex. Our long-term plan will be to continue to maximise our new assets, enhance strategic local and foreign collaboration partnership that supplement our in-house capabilities, broaden our scope of services and products, participate in more work categories and enhanced engineering works. Human resource management and retainment will be crucial for us to expand our capabilities and in becoming a leading O&G service provider. We continue to aspire to be the most sought after, reliable and efficient one-stop service centre for O&G companies, covering all aspects of customers' maintenance needs, EPCC and turnaround supports. We will continue with our business plan to expand joint tendering with selective partners to capture long-term integrated service contracts and expand our market base further.

Frontken Singapore (Engineering)–In 2023, we continued to achieve an improved financial performance as a result of better market condition. The continual engagement to tap into the non-traditional type of industries, new projects from non-traditional service offering and upturn in the O&G sector also helped our cause.

Despite facing competitive pricing pressure, lack of suitable skilled candidates and increased cost, we were able to overcome these hurdles by managing our resources wisely and cross training our skilled employees to enhance production efficiency. During the year, we saw increased activities for thermal spray processes from our existing customers and parts fabrication project for solar panel manufacturers. Activities for rotating equipment such as compressors and blowers as well as static component from petrochemical complexes in Jurong Island are expected to increase with upcoming planned shutdowns. We believe revenue for this portion of our business will continue to contribute positively to the Group's performance.

Moving forward, we will continue to seek opportunities to tap into new markets such as consumer products' manufacturers with continual emphasis on O&G and petrochemical industries.

Frontken Philippines - The Group's operation in the Philippines achieved a revenue of RM15.1 million, an increase of  $9\%$  compared to the year before attributable to additional projects from the power industry. The uptick in revenue coupled with ongoing savings initiatives contributed to an operating profit of RM2.1 million, an increase of  $7\%$  year on year.

# CHAIRMAN'SMESSAGE (CONT'D)

The enhancements in our capabilities, specifically the Large Vertical Lathe Machine and Cold Metal Transfer Welding Machine, have empowered us to undertake larger-scale projects concurrently. This has allowed us to meet deadlines and uphold the stringent quality standards demanded by our customers. Our focus will be in the power generation industry as we believe significant grow area for us to remain the same as the Philippines' Government aims for energy self-sufficiency.

Moving forward, we will continue to enhance our competency through comprehensive training initiatives and strategic partnerships with industry and technology experts. These efforts are integral to our goal of becoming recognised as experts in our field of services, ensuring that we deliver top-notch solutions and remain at the forefront of the industries we serve.

# OUTLOOK

We believe there are many organic growth opportunities ahead of us, particularly in the semiconductor front end space. With that in mind, we will continue to explore the same to develop our core businesses and continue to take a pragmatic approach towards the development of our customers and partners.

We will continue to take a long-term view of the industry and our business while making the most of our unique strengths. We believe that with our leading market position and the strategic actions we have taken over the years will allow us to benefit from the longer-term growth in the years ahead. We remain cautiously optimistic in our ability to deliver increasing shareholders return through underlying profit growth and sustainable dividend payment.

# APPRECIATION

I would like to take this opportunity to thank our Board of Directors for its continuous guidance, strategic advice and steadfast support throughout the year. On behalf of the Board, I would like to welcome our new Independent Non-Executive Director, YM Raja Jastina Adlina Binti Raja Arshad who joined the Board in August of last year.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
IN RM'000

# REVENUE

The Group's revenue of RM500.1 million for FY2023 was  $3\%$  lower than that achieved in the previous year mainly due to slower demand from the semiconductor industry.

# FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONT'D)

An analysis of revenue by customer location showed weaker demand from our customers in Taiwan and Singapore, resulting from a slowdown in the global semiconductor market.

The improvement in the Group's local business was largely due to increased orders from the various contracts for the provision of engineering services, manpower supply and also mechanical rotating equipment services and parts that the Group has with the oil majors.

# EARNINGS

The Group's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation ("EBITDA") for FY2023 was RM4.8 million or  $3\%$  lower than that achieved in the preceding year mainly due to lower revenue from our subsidiaries in Taiwan and Singapore.

Compared to last year, the profit after tax for the Group decreased by  $8\%$  mainly due to lower revenue and higher withholding tax imposed on the dividend declared by Taiwan subsidiary. If the Group were to exclude the withholding tax and foreign currency exchange impact from the equation, for a like-for-like comparison, the current year's performance would have only been  $2.5\%$  lower than the preceding year; a very commendable performance under very challenging operating environment for the space the Group operates in.

The consolidated net profit attributable to shareholders of the Company for FY2023 decreased by RM11.3 million or  $9\%$  compared to the preceding year. This Group's basic earnings per share decreased from 7.8 sen to 7.1 sen for FY2023.

The free cash flow increased by RM39.7 million to RM129.9 million in FY2023 mainly due to higher cash flow generated from operating activities and lower capital expenditure.

The net cash generated from operating activities in FY2023 increased to RM144.0 million. Net cash used for investing activities decreased by RM50.0 million to RM8.7 million in FY2023 due to lower capital expenditure. The net cash outflow of RM71.8 million for financing activities consists mainly of repayment of money market loan and payments of dividends.

The Group cash and cash equivalents increased from RM327.4 million to RM404.4 million as of 31 December 2023, which will provide the Group with financial flexibility to fund future growth initiatives.

# FINANCIAL POSITION

The Group's shareholders' fund improved from RM548.5 million to RM641.2 million as of 31 December 2023, an increase of  $17\%$ .

The Group's total assets were RM885.4 million as of 31 December 2023, an increase of RM79.6 or  $10\%$  from RM805.8 million a year ago. It was primarily due to the increase in the Group's cash and bank balances and fixed deposits with licensed banks by RM56.5 million and the increase in short-term investments by RM20.7 million. The Group's liabilities decreased by RM20.4 million to RM197.5 million as of 31 December 2023 mainly due to the repayment of the money market loan.

# MESSAGE FROM SUSTAINABILITY COMMITTEE

# DEAR STAKEHOLDERS,

Over the past two decades, Frontken Group has been dedicated to building technology and providing services that empower our customers to embrace sustainability, fostering a positive impact on our environment, communities, and society at large. Our commitment revolves around integrating technology, best practices, strategic partnerships, and streamlined processes, all united by a singular mission — to advance sustainability through actionable technology. Together with our customers, employees, and stakeholders, we strive to make a meaningful contribution to the environment and society.

At Frontken Group, our unwavering commitment extends to health, safety, environmental responsibility, corporate accountability, and sustainable development. Our global focus is on delivering products, services, and technologies that not only enhance and promote sustainable business practices but also explicitly contribute to addressing the challenges outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals. We believe in the power of collaboration and collective efforts to create a more sustainable future, and we look forward to continuing our journey of making a positive difference in the world.

In the fiscal year 2023 ("FY2023"), our journey was marked by considerable challenges, as the preceding two years unfolded a series of significant events that rapidly shaped a highly intricate and uncertain landscape. This period has highlighted both the resilience and fragility of our global economic, environmental, social, and governance systems. The world collectively navigated through a global supply chain disruption, prolonged conflicts, diverse natural disasters, and heightened political tensions, alongside grappling with challenges such as high inflation and economic slowdown.

As we adapt to the new realities forged by these challenges, our concerns now encompass critical issues like climate change, environmental conservation, peace, prosperity, and economic recovery. It is evident that the global business community needs a profound industrial transformation, fostering collaboration, and making necessary adjustments to navigate these complexities. Responding with heightened innovation, embracing responsible technology, adopting sustainable business operations, mitigating carbon emissions, and transitioning to sustainable energy sources are imperative steps.

To address these challenges effectively, it is crucial for businesses to prioritise compliance with laws and regulations, uphold high ethical standards, and integrate sustainability into their overall development strategy. Our commitment is to contribute to this transformative journey, fostering responsible practices and making a positive impact on the global stage. Together, through innovation and sustainable practices, we can create a more resilient and equitable future for all.

# RESPONSIBLE CLIMATE CHANGE

The climate change challenges we are currently grappling with represent a global threat to humanity. Tackling these challenges requires an extraordinary level of understanding, sacrifice, and execution. Carbon dioxide (CO2), a global pollutant, defies containment within specific locations, making it a pervasive reality. The consequences of global indecision in the face of climate change will inevitably lead to dangerously elevated heat levels, widespread droughts, floods, and severe hardships for millions of people worldwide.

The impacts of climate change are far-reaching and have extensive, disastrous effects on our environment. These include, but are not limited to, the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as floods and famines. Additionally, climate change contributes to alterations in sea temperature, ocean acidity, and the eventual rise in sea levels. These changes collectively pose significant threats to the delicate balance of our ecosystems and the well-being of communities across the globe.

The Board is collectively responsible to the Company's shareholders for the long-term success of the Group in terms of strategic direction, values and governance. The Board is led by experienced and knowledgeable Directors who provide the Company with the core competencies and the leadership necessary for the Group to meet its business objectives.

The Directors are aware of their responsibility to take decisions objectively which promote the success of the Group for the benefits of its stakeholders. The role and responsibilities of the Board, which are delineated in the Board Charter is available on the Company's website at www.frontken.com and are summarised as follows:

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW STATEMENT (CONT'D)

# PRINCIPLE A - BOARD LEADERSHIP AND EFFECTIVENESS (CONT'D)

# I. BOARD RESPONSIBILITIES (CONT'D)

The Chairman of the Board, leads the Board in fulfilling its fiduciary and stewardship roles. The Board Charter sets out the Chairman's responsibilities as follows:

- Lead the Board in deliberating the business and affairs of the Company and its oversight on Management;  
- Oversee the Board in discharging of its supervisory and stewardship role;  
- Oversee an efficient organisation and conduct of Board's function and meetings;  
Facilitate the effective contribution by all Directors;

The role of day-to-day management of the Group's business development and operations, including implementation of Board's policies and decisions, is helmed by the Chief Executive Officer, assisted by his fellow Executive Director. The Board is mindful of the dual role held by Mr Ng Wai Pin as the Board Chairman and Chief Executive Officer which is a departure from Practice 1.3 of the MCCG that states that the positions of Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer are to be held by different individuals. The Board is of the view that there is no concentration of power and authority, and that no one individual has unfettered powers for decision making, especially when the Board comprises a majority of Non-Executive Directors. Furthermore, such Non-Executive Directors are individuals of calibre, credibility and are free from any relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their objective judgement. These four (4) Non-Executive Directors (three (3) of whom are Independent Non-Executive) are capable of exercising objective and unbiased judgement to ensure fair and objective deliberations at Board meetings.

To enhance accountability, the Board has established clear functions reserved for itself and those delegated to the Management. There is a formal schedule of matters reserved to the Board for its deliberation and decision to ensure the direction and control of the Company are in its hands. Key matters reserved for the Board include the approval of annual budgets, quarterly and annual financial statements for announcement, investment, and divestiture, as well as monitoring of the Group's financial and operating performance. Such delineation of roles is clearly set out in the Board Charter. Delegation of authorities has also been formalised to ensure a balance between operational efficiency and control over corporate and financial governance.

The Company has a Code of Conduct for its Directors and employees, available on the Company's website. The Board has also formalised in writing its Whistle Blowing Policies and Procedures and Anti Bribery and Corruption Policy ("ABC Policy"), for employees to raise genuine concerns, without fear of reprisal, about possible improprieties on matters pertaining to financial reporting, compliance, fraud, corruption, malpractices, and unethical business conduct within the Group.

The Non-Executive Directors, which comprise majority of Board members, provide the necessary checks and balances in the Board's exercise of its functions by providing an objective and unbiased evaluation of the Board's decisions and decision-making process.

The Executive Directors are complemented by the experience and independent views of the Non-Executive Directors who are professionals in the field of finance, accounting, administration, strategic and business management, and research and development. The Board members possess a fair range of business, finance, administration, research and development, and legal experience. Mixed skills and experience are pivotal in directing and supervising the Group's overall business activities in light of the increasingly challenging economic and operating environment in which the Group operates. The profile of each Director is set out on pages 20 to 22 of the Company's 2023 Annual Report.

The NC is entrusted to assess the adequacy and appropriateness of the Board composition, identifying and recommending suitable candidates for Board membership and also to assess annually the performance of the Directors, succession plans and Board diversity, covering gender, age and ethnicity diversity, training courses for Directors and other qualities of the Board, including core-competencies which the Independent Non-Executive Directors should bring to the Board.

# II. BOARD COMPOSITION (CONT'D)

The Board has conducted a Board effectiveness evaluation including questions on Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG") and test on Fit and Proper for Directors standing for re-election at the forthcoming 20th Annual General Meeting ("AGM"), in February 2024 to assess the effectiveness of the Board, Board Committees and Individual Directors. The carefully designed and independently conducted Board evaluation process identified the strengths of the Board as well as areas for improvements. A detailed self-assessment is undertaken to assess the effectiveness of the Board as a whole and the Board Committees as well as the contribution, performance and time commitment of each individual Director. The Board evaluation process was conducted via a set of questionnaires containing both quantitative and open-ended questions, based on self and peer-rating by the Chairman of the Board and respective Chairmen of the Board Committees, and the outcome of the evaluation was tabled to the NC for discussion and matters that required attention of the Board were escalated to the Board Meetings for further deliberations and actions.

Based on the evaluation conducted, the NC was satisfied with the existing Board composition and concluded that each Director has the requisite competence and capability to serve on the Board and had sufficiently demonstrated their commitment to the Group in terms of time and participation during the financial year under review and recommended to the Board for the re-election of the retiring Directors at the Company's AGM. All assessments and evaluations carried by the NC in discharge of its functions were duly documented.

The NC has assessed the independence of the three (3) Independent Non-Executive Directors, namely Mr Ng Chee Whye, Ms Koh Huey Min and YM Raja Jastina Adlina Binti Raja Arshad. Following the recommendation of the NC, the Board is of the opinion that the independence of the Independent Non-Executive Directors remained unimpaired and their judgement over business dealings of the Company were not influenced by the interest of the other Directors or substantial shareholders.

The Company has established a policy for setting targets for gender, ethnic or age composition in the Board. However, the Board believes that more importantly, the suitability of candidates should be evaluated based on the candidates' competency, character, time availability, integrity, and experience in meeting the Company's needs. The Board constantly advocates fair and equal participation and opportunity for all individuals of the right calibre.

A summary of key activities undertaken by the NC in discharging its duties during the financial year under review and up to the date of this Statement is set out below:

- Reviewed and assessed the independence of Independent Non-Executive Directors;  
- Reviewed and recommended the re-election of retiring Directors, including the "Fit and Proper" test as a set out in the policy, the continuance of which requires shareholders' approval to be determined at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting;  
Assessed the effectiveness of the Board as a whole, the Board Committees and the contribution of each individual Director;  
- Considered the training undertaken by the Directors; and  
- Reviewed and assessed the term of office and performance of the Audit Committee and each of its members.

# III. REMUNERATION

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW STATEMENT (CONT'D)

# PRINCIPLE B - EFFECTIVE AUDIT AND RISK MANAGEMENT

# I. AUDIT COMMITTEE

To assist in the discharge of its duties on financial reporting, the Board has established an Audit Committee, comprising three (3) Non-Executive Directors, with Mr Ng Chee Whye, an Independent Non-Executive Director, as the Committee Chairman. The Committee's composition, including its roles and responsibilities as well as a summary of its activities carried out during the financial year under review, are set out in the Audit Committee Report on pages 67 to 69 of this Annual Report. One of the key responsibilities of the Audit Committee is to ensure that the financial statements of the Group and Company comply with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and provisions of the Companies Act 2016. Such financial statements comprise the quarterly financial report announced to Bursa Securities and the annual statutory financial statements.

The Board understands its role in upholding the integrity of financial reporting by the Company. Accordingly, the Audit Committee, which assists the Board in this aspect, has adopted a policy for the types of non-audit services permitted to be provided by the external auditors and/or their affiliates, including the need for obtaining the Audit Committee's approval for such services.

To enhance transparency and governance, the Audit Committee has also formalised the Policies And Procedures To Assess The Suitability, Objectivity And Independence Of External Auditors that requires a former audit partner to observe a cooling-off period of at least three (3) years if this person is sought to be appointed as an Audit Committee member. This applies to all partners of the external audit firm and/or its affiliate firm. The cooling off period safeguards the independence of the audit by avoiding the potential threats which may arise when a former partner of the external audit firm is in position to exert significant influence over the audit and preparation of the Company's financial statements.

# II. RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL FRAMEWORK

The Board has overall responsibility for maintaining a sound system of risk management and internal control of the Group that provides reasonable assurance on efficient business operations, compliance with laws and regulations as well as internal procedures and guidelines to achieve corporate objectives.

The Audit Committee assists the Board in reviewing the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the system of risk management and internal control in the Group. The Audit Committee does this by deploying an independent outsourced internal audit function as well as an in-house internal audit function that conduct internal audit, with findings presented to the Audit Committee, including the remedial measures and action plans agreed by Management to address the matters so highlighted. For more details of Internal Audit, both for the outsourced and in-house functions, refer to the Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control which is included in the Company's 2023 Annual Report as well as the Corporate Governance Report that is made available on the Company's website at www.frontken.com.

The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the risk management framework and policies while Management of the respective business units and subsidiaries is tasked to manage business risks, including developing, implementing and monitoring mitigating measures to manage such risks to acceptable levels. Details of the Group's Risk Management framework, activities carried out for the financial year under review and reporting processes are set out in the Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control included in this Annual Report.

The Board is of the opinion that thus far, the existing risk management framework and policies are effective in monitoring and mitigating the present risks of the Group to acceptable levels in safeguarding the interest of shareholders, customers, employees and other stakeholders and the Group's assets but would continually to review and update the framework and policies to meet new and/or changing risks affecting the Group on an on-going basis.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE OVERVIEW STATEMENT (CONT'D)

PRINCIPLE C - INTEGRITY IN CORPORATE REPORTING AND MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP WITH STAKEHOLDERS

# I. COMMUNICATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS

The Board recognises the importance of being transparent and accountable to the Company's stakeholders and acknowledges that continuous communication between the Company and its stakeholders facilitates mutual understanding of each other's objectives and expectations. As such, the Board ensures the supply of clear, comprehensive, and timely information to stakeholders by way of various disclosures and announcements, including quarterly and annual financial results which provide investors with up-to-date financial information of the Group. All these announcements and other information about the Company, which are disseminated according to the Company's Corporate Disclosure Policy, are available on the Company's website at www.frontken.com where shareholders, investors and the general public may access.

In addition, the Directors also ensure that engagement with shareholders occurs at least once a year during the AGM to better understand their needs and obtain their feedback.

# II. CONDUCT OF GENERAL MEETINGS

The AGM is the principal forum for shareholder dialogue, allowing shareholders to review the Group's performance through the Company's Annual Report and pose questions to the Board for clarification.

The 19th AGM of the Company was held virtually at the Broadcast venue Tricor Business Centre, Manuka 2 & 3 Meeting Room, Unit 29-01, Level 29, Tower A, Vertical Business Suite, Avenue 3, Bangsar South, No. 8, Jalan Kerinchi, 59200 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on Friday, 2 June 2023.

The completed list of questions together with the answers were posted on Bursa Securities' website on 27 June 2023 together with the minutes of the AGM.

For a heads up and to manage the shareholders' expectation, the Chairman before he opened to the floor to ask question, he told all present that he would use his best endeavour to deal with as many questions as possible that day. In the event if there were too many questions or if there is any question that needs further elaboration or the answer is factual in nature and could not be answered or provided that day, the answers would be posted on the Company's website.

This Statement is dated 27 March 2024.

# STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL

# PURPOSE OF STATEMENT

Paragraph 15.26(b) of the Main Market Listing Requirements of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad ("Bursa Securities") states that a listed issuer must ensure that its Board of Directors issues a statement ("Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control" or "Statement") about the state of risk management and internal control of the listed issuer as a group. The Statement must include adequate and meaningful information to enable shareholders and other stakeholders to make an informed assessment of the main features and adequacy of the listed issuer's risk management and internal control system as a group.

Accordingly, the Board of Directors ("Board") of Frontken Corporation Berhad ("Company") furnishes this Statement, which outlines the nature and scope of the system of risk management and internal control of the Group (comprising the Company and its subsidiaries) for the financial year ended 31 December 2023 and up to the date of approval of this Statement for inclusion in the Company's Annual Report. For purpose of disclosure, this Statement has considered and, where pertinent, including the mandatory contents outlined in the "Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control - Guidelines for Directors of Listed Issuers", a publication of Bursa Securities, which sets out guidance to listed issuers in drafting the Statement.

# BOARD'S RESPONSIBILITY ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL

The Board affirms its overall responsibility for the Group's system of risk management and internal control to safeguard shareholders' investment and the Group's assets as well as review the adequacy, integrity and operating effectiveness of this system in meeting the Group's corporate objectives. The Board is mindful of the need to establish clear roles and responsibilities in discharging its fiduciary and leadership functions in line with the Principles, Practices and Guidance of the Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance ("MCCG").

In view of the inherent limitations in any system of risk management and internal control ("System"), the System is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of not adhering to the Group's policies and achieving goals and objectives within the risk tolerance established by the Board and Management. The System can, therefore, only provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against any material misstatement, financial loss or fraud.

The Board has formalised an Enterprise Risk Management framework ("ERM Framework") that encompasses relevant policies and guidelines to streamline the Group's risk management imperatives in a structured and comprehensive manner to safeguard shareholders' investment and the Group's assets. This ERM Framework accords largely with the ISO31000:2018 Risk Management – Guidelines, which set out the key principles, framework and process of risk management. With this ERM Framework, the Board has established an on-going process to identify, evaluate, control, report and monitor significant business risks faced by the Group on an ongoing basis.

The Board, through its Audit Committee, reviews the outcome of this risk management process, including actions taken and mitigating measures implemented by Management to address the key risks as identified. This process has been in place for the financial year under review and up to the date of approval of this Statement for inclusion in the Annual Report of the Company.

# RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK - EXTENT OF COVERAGE

Risk management is embodied in the Group's key business processes through the ERM Framework, which sets out, among others, an easy-to-understand step-by-step approach to identify and evaluate risks faced by business units and, by extension, the Group. To harmonise risk management initiatives and activities, the Board has formalised in writing relevant risk management policies and guidelines for adherence by business units across the Group. The ERM Framework comprises a structured assessment process, culminating in the compilation of specific risk profiles of key business units and companies in the Group by Risk Management Units ("RMUs"), including the semi-annual update of risk profiles to consider the vagaries of evolving business environment as well as emerging risks.

# STATEMENT ON RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL (CONT'D)

# RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK - EXTENT OF COVERAGE (CONT'D)

The individual risks are scored for their likelihood of occurrence and the impact thereof based on a '5 by 5' risk matrix, deploying parameters established for each key business unit or company in the Group. The risk parameters comprise relevant financial and non-financial metrics for risks to be evaluated or quantified, as the case may be, in terms of the likelihood of their occurrence and the impact thereof. The use of such metrics essentially articulates the Board's risk appetite, i.e. the extent of risk the Group is prepared to take or seek in achieving its business objectives.

Details of specific risks are documented in individual risk registers, covering the risk description, root causes, risk consequences, internal controls implemented by Management to address the root causes, Management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls and the residual risk rating, i.e. the balance of risk after considering the effects of internal controls deployed to manage the exposure. The action plans that Management has taken and/or is taking to mitigate the risks to acceptable levels are reported by the RMUs to the Audit Committee and the outcome is documented in the Audit Committee meeting minutes, including any comments that the Audit Committee may have and such meeting minutes were also presented to the Board. The Audit Committee is tasked to brief the Board on the outcome of the risk update and mitigating measures deployed, including any significant issues therefrom. For each of the business risks identified, a risk owner is entrusted to ensure appropriate actions are taken to mitigate the risk to an acceptable level within specified timeline. The Risk Coordinator of the Group, when reviewing the risk update carried out by business units, enquires into the status of action plans undertaken by the Management of the business units concerned before reporting to the Audit Committee.

During the financial year under review, additional risks identified by the business units together with the actions taken or being taken by Management to mitigate or reduce these additional risks were reported by the Risk Coordinator to the Audit Committee and only those that warranted the attention of the Board were recommended by the Audit Committee to the Board for its deliberation and approval. Whereas matters or decisions made within the purview of the Audit Committee were only escalated to the Board for its information and notation.

# INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM - THE KEY FEATURES

Besides those internal controls implemented by Management to mitigate the risks as mentioned above, the Group's internal control system also covers the following salient elements:

- an organisation structure with clearly defined lines of responsibilities and appropriate levels of delegation and authority, including financial limits of authority in approving transactions and activities as well as mandate to operate bank accounts. This structure also sets out clear reporting lines and segregation of duties for key processes like strategic management, operations, sales and collections, procurement and payment, human resource management, capital expenditure, research and development, financial reporting, corporate affairs and investments;  
- a process of hierarchical reporting which provides a documented and auditable trail of accountability, with appropriate sign-off by personnel entrusted with the responsibilities;  
- an annual budgetary exercise that requires all business units and companies in the Group to formulate financial budgets which are then consolidated into a Group budget, presented to the Board for comments and ultimate approval. Quarterly reviews of the Group's performance against budget are carried out at Board meetings where explanations on significant variances or unusual fluctuations are furnished by Management. Management meetings at the operational level are conducted to review financial performance against business plans and monitor the respective business unit's performance against budget;  
- significant changes in business development are reported by Management to the Board at scheduled meetings. This oversight review enables the Board to evaluate and monitor the Group's business performance vis-à-vis its strategic objectives;

# INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM - THE KEY FEATURES (CONT'D)

Besides those internal controls implemented by Management to mitigate the risks as mentioned above, the Group's internal control system also covers the following salient elements: (cont'd)

- the Audit Committee, which is entrusted by the Board to oversee, among others, the Company's financial reporting process, in particular the quarterly and annual announcements of the Group's financial performance, meets at least quarterly to review the announcements, seeks clarification and explanations from Management before recommending the announcements to the Board for approval;  
- internal policies and procedures on key business processes are formalised in writing for application by personnel across the Group. These policies and procedures provide the necessary guidance to personnel on complying with internal control requirements and applicable laws and regulations;  
- structured whistle-blower policies and procedures are formalised in writing to enable employees of the Group to raise genuine concerns about suspected improprieties on matters of financial reporting, non-compliance with laws and regulations, malpractices or unethical business conduct within the Group at the earliest opportunity and in an appropriate way without fear of reprisal. Mr Ng Chee Whye, the Independent Non-Executive Director, with his contact details uploaded to the website of the Company is the person to contact on such concerns; and  
- where issues arise that affect the reliability and integrity of financial information of any business unit, special audits would be commissioned by the Audit Committee or Senior Management, as the case may be to assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities.

# INTERNAL AUDIT FUNCTION - ITS COMPOSITION AND SCOPE OF COVERAGE

The Group has two (2) groups of internal auditors, i.e. one covering the operations of the Group (save for Taiwan operations), and the other covering solely the Taiwan operations. The internal audit function of the Group (save for Taiwan operations) is outsourced to an independent professional firm, namely Sterling Business Alignment Consulting Sdn Bhd. The internal audit function for the Taiwan operations is an in-house function, i.e. the internal audit personnel are employees of the subsidiary in Taiwan, namely Ares Green Technology Corporation ("AGTC").

The appointment of the outsourced internal audit service provider followed an assessment of its suitability and capability by the Audit Committee of the Company whilst the performance of the in-house internal audit function is under the oversight of AGTC's Board.

# Outsourced internal audit coverage - Group (save for Taiwan operations)

The outsourced internal audit team is helmed by an average of four (4) professionals from the firm, a corporate member of the Institute of Internal Auditor Malaysia. The team is led by Ms So Hsien Ying, a Certified Internal Control Professional, was to conduct an assessment of the Group's system of internal control during the financial year under review, focusing on selected significant business units and reporting its observations, including Management's response and action plans thereto, directly to the Audit Committee. The internal audit function also conducted a follow-up on the status of implementation of action plans by Management on the recommendations highlighted, as deemed relevant. The Audit Committee took note of the recommended improvement actions and questions were posed to Management on the timeliness of measures to address the issues as reported.

The internal audit plan for the financial year was prepared based largely on the Group's financial information and the relative risks of the business units to the achievement of the Group's business objectives. This approach deployed aligns with the International Professional Practices Framework of the Institute of Internal Auditors Inc. ("IIA"), which encompasses, inter-alia, the Definition of Internal Auditing, Code of Ethics, Core Principles and International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing, and the IIA Risk Based Internal Auditing Guidance.

In carrying out her work, she adopted the internal audit guidelines from the Regulations Governing Establishment of Internal Control Systems by Public Companies issued by Taiwan Financial Supervisory Commission. The in-house internal auditor has conducted an assessment of AGTC's system of internal control during the financial year under review, focusing on selected significant areas as approved by the Board of AGTC and reported her observations, including Management's response and action plans thereto, directly to the Board of AGTC.

# OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Before the financial statements of the Group and of the Company were made out, the directors took reasonable steps:

(a) to ascertain that proper action had been taken in relation to the writing off of bad debts and the making of allowance for impairment losses on receivables, and satisfied themselves that there are no known bad debts and that adequate allowance had been made for impairment losses on receivables; and  
(b) to ensure that any current assets which were unlikely to realise their book values in the ordinary course of business had been written down to their estimated realisable values.

At the date of this report, the directors are not aware of any circumstances:

(a) which would require the writing off of bad debts, or the additional allowance for impairment losses on receivables in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company; or  
(b) which would render the values attributed to current assets in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company misleading; or  
(c) which have arisen which render adherence to the existing method of valuation of assets or liabilities of the Group and of the Company misleading or inappropriate; or  
(d) not otherwise dealt with in this report or the financial statements which would render any amount stated in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company misleading.

At the date of this report, there does not exist:

(a) any charge on the assets of the Group and of the Company which has arisen since the end of the financial year which secures the liability of any other person; or  
(b) any contingent liability of the Group and of the Company which has arisen since the end of the financial year.

No contingent or other liability has become enforceable or is likely to become enforceable within the period of twelve months after the end of the financial year which, in the opinion of the directors, will or may substantially affect the ability of the Group and of the Company to meet their obligations as and when they fall due.

In the opinion of the directors, no item, transaction or event of a material and unusual nature has arisen in the interval between the end of the financial year and the date of this report which is likely to affect substantially the results of the operations of the Group and of the Company for the financial year in which this report is made.

(Incorporated in Malaysia)

Registration No: 200401012517 (651020 - T)

# REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Frontken Corporation Berhad, which comprise the statements of financial position as at 31 December 2023 of the Group and of the Company, and the statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows of the Group and of the Company for the financial year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including material accounting policy information, as set out on pages 83 to 161.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and of the Company as at 31 December 2023, and of their financial performance and their cash flows for the financial year then ended in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.

# Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Independence and Other Ethical Responsibilities

We are independent of the Group and of the Company in accordance with the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, Conduct and Practice) of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants ("By-Laws") and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) ("IESBA Code"), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the By-Laws and the IESBA Code.

# Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.

<table><tr><td>Impairment of Goodwill on ConsolidationRefer to Note 15 to the financial statements.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Key Audit Matter</td><td>How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter</td></tr><tr><td>The Group has goodwill of approximately RM33.8 million comprised within the 3 cash-generating units (&quot;CGU&quot;).For the CGUs which comprised goodwill, the determination of recoverable amount, being the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use, requires judgement on the part of management in identifying and then valuing the relevant CGUs.The value-in-use models used to assess the risk of impairment are based on assumptions including revenue forecasts, gross and operating margins and discount rates, all of which are country-specific.We focused on this area because of the inherent judgement involved in determining key assumptions such as future sales growth, profit margins, discount rates and terminal value.</td><td>Our procedures included, among others:a) Making enquiries of and challenging the management on the key assumptions made, including:i. the achievement of the business plan; andii. sales growth, operating margin, discount rates and long-term growth rates;b) Performing sensitivity analysis on key assumptions and agreeing with management&#x27;s conclusion to ascertain the extent of change that individually, or in combination, would be required for the goodwill to be impaired; andc) Assessing the adequacy of disclosure of goodwill in the financial statements.</td></tr></table>

# Key Audit Matters (Cont'd)

<table><tr><td>Recoverability of Trade ReceivablesRefer to Note 14 to the financial statements.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Key Audit Matter</td><td>How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter</td></tr><tr><td>The trade receivables of the Group amounted to approximately RM119 million and it constituted 21% of the total current assets of the Group.We focused on this area due to the outstanding receivable balances which exceeded the credit term granted by the Group. The total outstanding balances which exceeded the credit term amounted to approximately RM22 million is considered to be of a higher credit risk.The assessment of recoverability of these outstanding receivables involved judgement and estimation of uncertainty by Management.</td><td>Our procedures included, among others:a) Testing the adequacy of the Group&#x27;s allowance for impairment losses on trade receivables by assessing the Group&#x27;s policy and historical data from the Group&#x27;s previous collection experience;b) Reviewing the Group&#x27;s subsequent collection after the financial year for major receivables;c) Reviewing the expected credit loss assessment by challenging whether the historic experience is representative of the current circumstances and of recent losses incurred in the receivables and assessing the reasonableness of forward-looking adjustments; andd) Assessing the adequacy of disclosure in the financial statements.</td></tr></table>

# Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditors' Report Thereon

The directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but does not include the financial statements of the Group and of the Company and our auditors' report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Statements

The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that give a true and fair view in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The directors are also responsible for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

# Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.  
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's and the Company's internal control.  
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.  
- Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's or the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.  
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.  
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements of the Group. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.

From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current financial year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# 3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION

Critical Accounting Estimates And Judgements

Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty

Management believes that there are no key assumptions made concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year other than as disclosed below:

(i) Impairment of Goodwill on Consolidation

The assessment of whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill is allocated. Estimating a value in use amount requires management to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. The carrying amount of goodwill on consolidation as at the reporting date is disclosed in Note 15 to the financial statements.

(ii) Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment and Right-Of-Use Assets

The Group determines whether an item of its property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets is impaired by evaluating the extent to which the recoverable amount of the asset is less than its carrying amount. This evaluation is subject to changes such as market performance, economic and political situation of the country. A variety of methods is used to determine the recoverable amount, such as valuation reports and discounted cash flows. The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets as at the reporting date are disclosed in Notes 11 and 12 to the financial statements respectively.

Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty (Cont'd)

(iii) Depreciation of Property, Plant and Equipment

The estimates for the residual values, useful lives and related depreciation charges for the property, plant and equipment is based on commercial factors which could change significantly as a result of technical innovations and competitors' actions in response to the market conditions. The Group anticipates that the residual values of its property, plant and equipment will be insignificant. As a result, residual values are not being taken into consideration for the computation of the depreciable amount. Changes in the expected level of usage and technological development could impact the economic useful lives and the residual values of these assets, therefore future depreciation charges could be revised. The carrying amount of property, plant and equipment as at the reporting date is disclosed in Note 11 to the financial statements.

(iv) Income Taxes

There are certain transactions and computations for which the ultimate tax determination may be different from the initial estimate. The Group and the Company recognise tax liabilities based on its understanding of the prevailing tax laws and estimates of whether such taxes will be due in the ordinary course of business. Where the final outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recognised, such difference will impact the income tax expense and deferred tax balances in the year in which such determination is made. The carrying amounts of current tax liabilities of the Group and of the Company as at the reporting date are:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">The Group</td><td colspan="2">The Company</td></tr><tr><td>2023 
RM</td><td>2022

RM</td></tr><tr><td>Current tax liabilities</td><td>(20,810,377)</td><td>(23,964,622)</td><td>(17,084)</td><td>(15,000)</td></tr></table>

(v) Deferred Tax Assets

Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and unabsorbed capital allowances to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits would be available against which the deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and unabsorbed capital allowances could be utilised. Management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based on the assessment of the probability of the future taxable profits. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets as at the reporting date is disclosed in Note 16 to the financial statements.

(vi) Impairment of Trade Receivables

The Group uses the simplified approach to estimate a lifetime expected credit loss allowance for all trade receivables. The Group develops the expected loss rates based on the payment profiles of past sales and the corresponding historical credit losses, and adjusts for qualitative and quantitative reasonable and supportable forward-looking information. If the expectation is different from the estimation, such difference will impact the carrying value of trade receivables. The carrying amount of trade receivables as at the reporting date is disclosed in Note 14 to the financial statements.

(vii) Write-down of Inventories

Reviews are made periodically by management on damaged, obsolete and slow-moving inventories. These reviews require judgement and estimates. Possible changes in these estimates could result in revisions to the valuation of inventories. The carrying amount of inventories as at the reporting date is disclosed in Note 17 to the financial statements.

(viii) Impairment of Non-Trade Receivables

The loss allowances for non-trade financial assets are based on assumptions about risk of default (probability of default) and expected loss if a default happens (loss given default). It also requires the Group to assess whether there is a significant increase in credit risk of the non-trade financial asset at the reporting date. The Group uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting appropriate inputs to the impairment calculation, based on the past payment trends, existing market conditions and forward-looking information. The carrying amounts of other receivables and amount owing by subsidiaries as at the reporting date are disclosed in Notes 14 and 18 to the financial statements respectively.

Critical Judgements Made in Applying Accounting Policies

Management believes that there are no instances of application of critical judgement in applying the accounting policies of the Group and of the Company which will have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements other than as disclosed below:

(i) Lease Terms

Some leases contain extension options exercisable by the Group before the end of the non-cancellable contract period. In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances including the past practice and any cost that will be incurred to change the asset if an option to extend is not taken. An extension option is only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated).

(ii) Share-based Payments

The Group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of the equity investments at the date at which they are granted. The estimating of the fair value requires determining the most appropriate valuation model for a grant of equity instruments, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT'D)

# 3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT'D)

# Government Grants

The Group presents government grants related to an asset by setting up the grants as deferred income and are amortised to profit or loss on a systematic basis over the expected useful life of the relevant asset.

# Goodwill

Goodwill is initially measured at cost. Subsequent to the initial recognition, the goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. A bargain purchase gain is recognised in profit or loss immediately.

# Financial Instruments

# (i) Financial Assets

Financial Assets Through Profit or Loss

The financial assets are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to the initial recognition, the financial assets are remeasured to their fair values at the reporting date with fair value changes recognised in profit or loss. The fair value changes do not include interest and dividend income.

Financial Assets at Amortised Cost

The financial assets are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs except for trade receivables without significant financing component which are measured at transaction price only. Subsequent to the initial recognition, all financial assets are measured at amortised cost less any impairment losses.

Financial Assets Through Other Comprehensive Income

The financial assets are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs. Subsequent to the initial recognition, the financial assets are remeasured to their fair values at the reporting date with fair value changes taken up in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the fair value reserve, except for the recognition of impairment, interest income and foreign exchange difference of a debt instrument which are recognised directly in profit or loss. The fair value changes do not include interest and dividend income.

# (ii) Financial Liabilities

Financial Liabilities Through Profit or Loss

The financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to the initial recognition, the financial liabilities are remeasured to their fair values at the reporting date with fair value changes recognised in profit or loss. The fair value changes do not include interest expense.

Financial Liabilities at Amortised Cost

The financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value less transaction costs. Subsequent to the initial recognition, the financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost.

Financial Instruments (Cont'd)

(iii) Equity

Ordinary Shares

Ordinary shares are recorded on initial recognition at the proceeds received less directly attributable transaction costs incurred. The ordinary shares are not remeasured subsequently.

Treasury Shares

Treasury shares are recorded on initial recognition at the consideration paid less directly attributable transaction costs incurred. The treasury shares are not remeasured subsequently.

No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the treasury shares. If such shares are issued by resale, any difference between the sales consideration received and the carrying amount of the treasury shares is recognised in equity. Where treasury shares are cancelled, their carrying amounts are shown as a movement in retained profits.

(iv) Financial Guarantee Contracts

Financial guarantee contracts are recognised initially as liabilities at fair value, net of transaction costs. Subsequent to the initial recognition, the financial guarantee contracts are recognised as income in profit or loss over the period of the guarantee or, when there is no specific contractual period, recognised in profit or loss upon discharge of the guarantee. If the debtor fails to make payment relating to a financial guarantee contract when it is due and Group, as the issuer, is required to reimburse the holder for the associated loss, the reimbursement is recognised as a liability and measured at the higher of the amount of loss allowance determined using the expected credit loss model and the amount of financial guarantee initially recognised less cumulative amortisation.

# Property, Plant and Equipment

All items of property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost.

Subsequent to initial recognition, all property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.

Freehold land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their depreciable amounts over the estimated useful lives. The principal annual depreciation rates are:

<table><tr><td>Freehold buildings</td><td>25 - 50 years</td></tr><tr><td>Long-term leasehold buildings</td><td>60 years</td></tr><tr><td>Land improvement</td><td>14%</td></tr><tr><td>Factory and office renovation</td><td>5% - 10%</td></tr><tr><td>Plant and machinery</td><td>10% - 20%</td></tr><tr><td>Workshop tools</td><td>10% - 20%</td></tr><tr><td>Office equipment</td><td>10% - 33.3%</td></tr><tr><td>Furniture and fittings</td><td>10% - 33.3%</td></tr><tr><td>Motor vehicles</td><td>10% - 20%</td></tr><tr><td>Computers</td><td>33.3%</td></tr></table>

# 3. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT'D)

Investments in Subsidiaries

Investments in subsidiaries including the share options granted to employees of the subsidiaries, which are eliminated on consolidation, are stated in the separate financial statements of the Company at cost less impairment losses, if any.

# Right-of-use Assets and Lease Liabilities

(i) Short-term Leases and Leases of Low-value Assets

The Group and the Company apply the "short-term lease" and "lease of low-value assets" recognition exemption. For these leases, the Group and the Company recognise the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line method over the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is more appropriate.

(ii) Right-of-use Assets

Right-of-use assets are initially measured at cost. Subsequent to the initial recognition, the right-of-use assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities.

The right-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the estimated useful lives of the right-of-use assets or the end of the lease term.

(iii) Lease Liabilities

Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the entities' incremental borrowing rate. Subsequent to the initial recognition, the lease liabilities are measured at amortised cost and adjusted for any lease reassessment or modifications.

# Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on the first-in, first-out method and comprises all costs of purchase plus other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.

# 4. OPERATING SEGMENTS

The Group has one reportable segment as the Group is principally engaged in one business segment which is the provision of engineering services.

The Group Chief Executive Officer (the chief operating decision maker) review internal management report at least on a quarterly basis.

Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items mainly comprise corporate assets and expenses.

Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire segment assets that are expected to be used for more than one period.

The Group is organised into the following geographical segments:

Malaysia  
Singapore  
- Philippines  
Taiwan  
- Indonesia

# 10. EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing profit after taxation attributable to owners of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the financial year.

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">The Group</td></tr><tr><td>2023</td><td>2022</td></tr><tr><td>Profit after taxation attributable to owners of the Company (RM)</td><td>111,950,507</td><td>123,291,868</td></tr><tr><td>Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue as of 1 January/31 December</td><td>1,572,906,425</td><td>1,571,899,466</td></tr><tr><td>Basic earnings per ordinary share attributable to equity holders of the Company (sen)</td><td>7.12</td><td>7.84</td></tr></table>

The potential conversion of warrants is anti-dilutive as its exercise price is higher than the average market price of the Company's ordinary shares during the current financial year and hence, the diluted earnings per share is equal to the basic earnings per share.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT'D)

# 15. GOODWILL ON CONSOLIDATION (CONT'D)

The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined using the value in use approach, and this is derived from the present value of the future cash flows from each CGU computed based on the projections of financial forecast covering a period of 5 years. The key assumptions used in the determination of the recoverable amounts are as follows:

<table><tr><td></td><td>2023 %</td><td>2022 %</td></tr><tr><td>Budgeted gross margin</td><td>16 to 59</td><td>18 to 58</td></tr><tr><td>Growth rates</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>- Year 1</td><td>3 to 5</td><td>3 to 10</td></tr><tr><td>- Year 2 to 5</td><td>3 to 8</td><td>3 to 11</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-tax discount rates</td><td>17 to 18</td><td>15 to 20</td></tr></table>

(i) Budgeted gross margin Management determines budgeted gross margin based on past performance and its expectations of market development.  
(ii) Growth rates The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts. Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market. These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management and extrapolated cash flows for a five-year period based on growth rates consistent with the long-term average growth rate for the industry.  
(iii) Discount rates Management estimates discount rate using pre-tax rate that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risk specific to the CGU. The rate used to discount the forecasted cash flows reflects specific risks and expected returns relating to the industry.  
(iv) Terminal value Terminal value is based on zero growth of projected present value of particular subsidiaries from year 2028 until infinity.

The management believes that there is no reasonable change in the above key assumptions which would cause the carrying amount of the goodwill to exceed its recoverable amounts.

# (ii) Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The exposure to interest rate risk arises mainly from investments in fixed rate debt securities and short-term borrowing with variable rate. The Group and the Company adopt a policy of obtaining the most favourable interest rates available and by maintaining a balanced portfolio of mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings.

The fixed rate debt instruments of the Group and of the Company are not subject to interest rate risk since neither carrying amounts nor the future cash flows will fluctuate because of a change in market interest rates.

Interest Rate Risk Sensitivity Analysis

The Group and the Company do not have any floating rate borrowings and hence, no sensitivity analysis is presented.

Market Risk (Cont'd)

(iii) Equity price risk

The exposure to equity price risk arises mainly from changes in quoted investment prices of the Group. The Group manages its exposure to equity price risk by maintaining a portfolio of equities with different risk profiles.

Equity Price Risk Sensitivity Analysis

If prices for quoted investments at the end of the reporting period strengthened by  $10\%$  (2022:  $10\%$ ) with all other variables being held constant, the Group's and the Company's profit after taxation would have increased by RM3,264,766 and RM1,736,961 (2022: RM1,198,567 and RM750,141) respectively. A  $10\%$  (2022:  $10\%$ ) weakening in the quoted prices would have had an equal but opposite effect on the Group's and the Company's profit after taxation.

# Credit Risk

The exposure to credit risk, or the risk of counterparties defaulting, arises mainly from receivables. The Group and the Company manages its exposure to credit risk by the application of credit approvals, credit limits and monitoring procedures on an ongoing basis. For other financial assets (including quoted investments, cash and bank balances), the Group and the Company minimise credit risk by dealing exclusively with high credit rating counterparties.

Also, the Company's exposure to credit risk includes loans and advances to subsidiaries, and corporate guarantee given to financial institutions for credit facilities granted to certain subsidiaries. The Company monitors the ability of the subsidiaries to serve their loans on an individual basis.

(i) Credit risk concentration profile

The Group's major concentration of credit risk relates to the amounts owing by 2 (2022: 2) customers which constituted approximately  $34\%$  (2022:  $27\%$ ) of its total trade receivables (including related parties) as at the end of the reporting period.

(ii) Maximum exposure to credit risk

At the end of the reporting period, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each class of financial assets recognised in the statement of financial position of the Group and of the Company after deducting any allowance for impairment losses (where applicable).

In addition, the Company's maximum exposure to credit risk also includes corporate guarantees provided to its subsidiaries as disclosed under the liquidity risk's 'Maturity Analysis' of item (i) below, representing the outstanding banking facilities of the subsidiaries as at the end of the reporting period. These corporate guarantees have not been recognised in the Company's financial statements since their fair value on initial recognition were not material.

Credit Risk (Cont'd)

(iii) Assessment of impairment losses

The Group has an informal credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis through periodic review of the ageing of the receivables. The Group closely monitors the receivables' financial strength to reduce the risk of loss.

At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether any of the financial assets at amortised cost are credit impaired.

The gross carrying amount of financial asset is written off against the associated impairment, if any, when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery despite the fact that they are still subject to enforcement activities.

A financial asset is credit impaired when any of following events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred:

Significant financial difficulty of the receivable;  
- A breach of contract, such as a default or past due event;  
- Restructuring of a debt in relation to the receivable's financial difficulty; and  
It is becoming probable that the receivable will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation.

The Group considers a receivable to be in default when the receivable is unlikely to repay its debt to the Group in full or is more than 365 days past due. The Group uses a more lagging past due criterion for certain trade receivables when it is more appropriate to reflect their loss patterns.

Trade receivables

The Group applies the simplified approach to measure expected credit losses which using a lifetime expected credit loss allowance for all trade receivables.

Inputs, Assumptions and Techniques used for Estimating Impairment Losses

To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables (including related parties) have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due.

The Group measures the expected credit losses of certain major customers, trade receivables that are credit impaired and trade receivables with a high risk of default on individual basis.

The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over 60 months (2022: 48 months) before the reporting date and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the trade receivables to settle their debts using the linear regressive analysis. The Group has identified the Gross Domestic Product as the key macroeconomic factor of the forward-looking information.

There are no significant changes in the estimation techniques and assumptions as compared to the previous financial year.

Other receivables

The Group and the Company apply the 3-stage general approach to measuring expected credit losses for its other receivables.

Inputs, Assumptions and Techniques used for Estimating Impairment Losses

Under this approach, the Group and the Company assess whether there is a significant increase in credit risk for receivables by comparing the risk of a default as at the reporting date with the risk of default as at the date of initial recognition. The Group and the Company consider there has been a significant increase in credit risk when there are changes in contractual terms or delay in payment. Regardless of the assessment, a significant increase in credit risk is presumed if a receivable is more than 30 days past due in making a contractual payment.

The Group and the Company use 3 categories to reflect their credit risk and how the loss allowance is determined for each category:

<table><tr><td>Category</td><td>Definition of Category</td><td>Loss Allowance</td></tr><tr><td>Performing:</td><td>Receivables have a low risk of default and a strong capacity to meet contractual cash flows</td><td>12-months expected credit losses</td></tr><tr><td>Underperforming:</td><td>Receivables for which there is a significant increase in credit risk</td><td>Lifetime expected credit losses</td></tr><tr><td>Not performing:</td><td>There is evidence indicating the receivable is credit impaired or more than 90 days past due</td><td>Lifetime expected credit losses</td></tr></table>

The Group and the Company measure the expected credit losses of receivables having significant balances, receivables that are credit impaired and receivables with a high risk of default on individual basis. Other receivables are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and assessed on collective basis.

Loss allowance is measured on either 12-month expected credit losses or lifetime expected credit losses, by considering the likelihood that the receivable would not be able to repay during the contractual period (probability of default, PD), the percentage of contractual cash flows that will not be collected if default happens (loss given default, LGD) and the outstanding amount that is exposed to default risk (exposure at default).

(iii) Assessment of impairment losses (Cont'd)

Other receivables (Cont'd)

Inputs, Assumptions and Techniques used for Estimating Impairment Losses (Cont'd)

In deriving the PD and LGD, the Group and the Company consider the receivable's past payment status and its financial condition as at the reporting date. The PD is adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the receivable to settle its debts using the linear regressive analysis. The Group and the Company have identified the Gross Domestic Product as the key macroeconomic factor of the forward-looking information.

There are no significant changes in the estimation techniques and assumptions as compared to the previous financial year.

Allowance for Impairment Losses

Based on the assessment performed, the identified impairment loss was immaterial and hence, it is not provided for.

- Fixed deposits with licensed banks, cash and bank balances

The Group and the Company consider the licensed banks have low credit risks. In addition, some of the bank balances are insured by Government agencies. Therefore, the Group and the Company are of the view that the loss allowance is immaterial and hence, it is not provided for.

Amount owing by subsidiaries

The Company applies the 3-stage general approach to measuring expected credit losses for amount owing by subsidiaries.

Inputs, Assumptions and Techniques used for Estimating Impairment Losses

The Company measures the expected credit losses on individual basis, which is aligned with its credit risk management practices on the inter-company balances.

The Company considers loans and advances to subsidiaries have low credit risks. The Company assumes that there is a significant increase in credit risk when a subsidiary's financial position deteriorates significantly. As the Company is able to determine the timing of payments of the loans and advances when they are payable, the Company considers the loans and advances to be in default when the subsidiaries are not able to pay when demanded.

For loans and advances that are repayable on demand, impairment loss is assessed based on the assumption that repayment of the outstanding balances is demanded at the reporting date. If the subsidiary does not have sufficient highly liquid resources when the loans and advances are demanded, the Company will consider the expected manner of recovery to measure the impairment loss; the recovery manner could be either through 'repayable over time' or a fire sale of less liquid assets by the subsidiary.

For loans and advances that are not repayable on demand, impairment loss is measured using techniques that are similar for estimating the impairment losses of other receivables as disclosed above.

The movements in the loss allowances are disclosed in Note 18 to the financial statements.

Financial Guarantee Contracts

Corporate guarantees for borrowing facilities granted to subsidiaries are financial guarantee contract.

Inputs, Assumptions and Techniques used for Estimating Impairment Losses

The Company closely monitors the subsidiaries' financial strength to reduce the risk of loss.

The Company considers there is a significant increase in credit risk when a subsidiary's financial position deteriorates significantly. A financial guarantee contract is credit impaired when:

- The subsidiary is unlikely to repay its obligation to the bank in full; or

- The subsidiary is having a deficit in equity and is continuously loss making.

The Company determines the probability of default of the guaranteed amounts individually using internal information available.

Allowance for Impairment Losses

All of the financial guarantee contracts are considered to be performing, have low risks of default and historically there were no instances where these financial guarantee contracts were called upon by the parties of which the financial guarantee contracts were issued to. Accordingly, no loss allowances were identified based on 12-month expected credit losses.

# (b) Capital Risk Management

The Group and the Company manage their capital to ensure that entities within the Group will be able to maintain an optimal capital structure so as to support its businesses and maximise shareholders value. To achieve this objective, the Group and the Company may make adjustments to the capital structure in view of changes in economic conditions, such as adjusting the amount of dividend payment, returning of capital to shareholders or issuing new shares.

The Group and the Company manage their capital based on debt-to-equity ratio. The Group's strategies were unchanged from the previous financial year. The debt-to-equity ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total equity. Net debt is calculated as external borrowings less cash and bank balances and fixed deposits with licensed banks.

There was no change in the approach to capital management during the financial year.

The debt-to-equity ratio is not disclosed in the financial statements as the external borrowing is insignificant.

# Explanatory Notes on Ordinary Business:

# 1. Item 1 of the Agenda

This Agenda item is meant for discussion only as the provision of Section 340(1)(a) of the Act does not require a formal approval of the shareholders for the Audited Financial Statements. Hence, this item is not put forward to shareholders for voting.

# 2. Item 2 of the Agenda

The Nomination Committee has evaluated Mr Ng Wai Pin, Mr Gerald Chiu Yoong Chian and YM Raja Jastina Adlina Binti Raja Arshad based on the Board Effectiveness Evaluation carried out in-house including the "Fit and Proper Test" to assess them and they were found to have met the Board's expectation in discharging their duties and responsibilities and recommended to the Board for their re-election. In turn, the Board recommends to the shareholders to re-elect Mr Ng Wai Pin, Mr Gerald Chiu Yoong Chian and YM Raja Jastina Adlina Binti Raja Arshad at the 20th AGM or any adjournment thereof.

# NOTICE OF TWENTIETH ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING (CONT'D)

# 3. Item 3 of the Agenda

Section 230(1) of the Act requires that the fees of the directors and any benefits payable to the directors be approved at a general meeting. The benefits comprised of travelling allowance.

# Explanatory Notes on Special Business:

# 4. Item 5 of the Agenda

The proposed Ordinary Resolution 6, if passed, will empower the Directors from the conclusion of this AGM, to allot and issue up to a maximum of  $10\%$  of the total number of issued shares of the Company (excluding treasury shares) at the time of issue (other than bonus or rights issue) until the conclusion of the next AGM of the Company without the need to convene a general meeting and for such purposes as they consider would be in the best interest of the Company. This authority, unless revoked or varied at a general meeting, will expire at the conclusion of next AGM of the Company. The Board is of the view that the  $10\%$  general mandate is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders as it would provide the flexibility to the Company for any possible fundraising activities that the Company may undertake for working capital and/or any investment or acquisition purposes in an expeditious and efficient manner. At this juncture, there is no decision to issue any additional share. If there should be a decision to issue any new share after the general mandate is sought, the Company will make an announcement in respect thereof.

The proposed Ordinary Resolution 6 is a renewal of the general mandate for issuance of shares pursuant to Sections 75 and 76 of the Act obtained at the 19th AGM held on 2 June 2023 which will lapse at the conclusion of this 20th AGM. As at the date of this notice, the Company did not issue any share pursuant to the said general mandate.

# 5. Item 6 of the Agenda

The proposed Ordinary Resolution 7, if passed, will give the Directors of the Company the authority to take all such steps as are necessary or expedient to implement, finalise, complete and/or effect the purchase(s) of Shares by the Company as the Directors may deem fit and expedient in the best interest of the Company. This authority will, unless renewed or revoked or varied by the Company at a general meeting, continue to be in force until the conclusion of the next AGM or any adjournment thereof of the Company or the expiry of the period within which the next AGM of the Company following the 20th AGM is required by the law to be held. Please refer to the Share Buy-Back Statement dated 29 April 2024 which is circulated together with this Notice for more information.
