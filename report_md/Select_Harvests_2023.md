Select Harvests is a leader in providing foods that are better for you and better for the planet. We remain committed to this and delivering value for our shareholders.

For FY2023 the business recorded a Net Operating Loss after Tax of $114.7m. We recognise the need to improve financial performance and the business has commenced enacting a revised business plan.

The safety performance of the Company further improved in FY2023 with a TRIFR of 6.7. This is the result of a strong focus on safety by the Company over a long period of time. The next step is to further imbed world class safety practices into our everyday operations, so this becomes the way we conduct operations.

Following a challenging FY2022, FY2023 delivered another set of weather-related factors to contend with. The year commenced with unprecedented rainfall across all of the Company's geographic footprint. This led to flooding across several of our orchards. We have recorded a write off for lost trees of  $4.1\text{m}$ , however more significant damage was averted due to the dedication and professionalism of the Company's employees in handling situations that have not been seen for a long period of time.

Recovering from the impact of the floods, the Company moved its focus to harvesting the 2023 crop. This harvest period was again more difficult than a typical year due to the wet and cool conditions impacting operating costs and crop quality levels. Once the crop started to be delivered to the processing centre it became evident that the expected volume of 30,000MT was not going to be reached. The last three years of a La Nina weather pattern had impacted the trees and they did not produce to their normal levels. This impact was seen across all of the Company's orchards and across the wider Australian almond industry.

In addition to the volume of nuts being lower the amount of weight in the actual kernel compared to the surrounding hull and shell was lower than average. This meant the trees put more of their energy into producing the protective hull and shell rather than the almond kernel. The consequence of both factors meant that the Company's 2023 crop was  $34\%$  lower than forecast at 19,771 MT. A substantial volume of the crop required drying and we applied the lessons from the prior year and effectively managed this at the Carina West Processing Facility. This year also saw the benefit of our more recent investment in sorting technology and allowed us to maximise the quality of the crop.

As the year moved forward into August with the Bloom for the 2024 crop, we were very pleased by the number of flowers across all farms. We secured bees and flight hours were positive.

However, the industry was impacted by the varroa mite incursion which has seen the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, move from an eradication phase to a management phase, meaning that going forward beekeepers will need to manage this pest as part of their practices. This had no impact on the 2024 crop pollination and the impact on the bee industry going forward will be closely monitored.

The global almond market continued the prior year pricing trend and remained subdued for FY2023 and our average sell price for the year was \(6.42/kg. The market purchased hand to mouth as it waited to see how the 2023 Californian crop developed and the pace at which carryout inventories reduced. Additionally, demand in the largest almond consumer market, the US, declined by \(6.3\%\). The Company achieved premium pricing in key export markets however the lower quality crop meant there were limited opportunities to capitalise on this.

The combination of the above factors has led to the FY2023 financial performance of the Company being materially affected. As a result, operating cashflows were negative and steps were put in place by management to reduce spend and speed cash velocity. As a result, the Company maintained its operations within its set banking limits.

To date the 2024 crop is progressing well with a successful bloom and good growing conditions, a favourable forecast of hotter and drier conditions over the final growing and harvesting periods and below average water pricing.

The management team have put in place improved systems, practices and processes to increase the capacity of the Carina West Processing Facility. This allows for an uplift in throughput volumes. As a result, a significant volume of external grower volumes have been contracted to be processed by Select Harvests in the FY2024 year adding a new profitable and low risk earnings stream.

Work continued through the FY2023 year on maximising the full usage and value of the biomass product produced when growing almonds. Select Harvests continue to develop a profitable circular economy model whereby hull and shell is used for compost, energy and cattle feedlots. Select Harvests have also been continuing work to reduce our carbon emissions with significant reductions being achieved through better fumigation practices.

# Financial Performance

Select Harvests delivered a FY2023 Net Loss After Tax of $114.7m. This loss was a result of three key factors:

i. The 2023 crop was  $34 \%$ lower than expectations. This was a result of three years of La Nina weather impacts. The impact of this was $74.5m  
ii. The value of the 2022 crop carryover inventory was written down further due to its poor quality profile as a result of the cooler and wetter season. The impact of this was $24.5m  
iii. The Company wrote off its goodwill intangible asset following a half year impairment assessment. The impact of this was \(26.0m.

The 2023 crop yields were lower across all orchards and age profiles. The impact of the La Nina weather events were widespread across the Australian almond industry. The Company is forecasting that the orchards will rebound strongly for the 2024 crop production. The wet and cooler conditions also

# GLOBAL ALMOND PRICING

USD Per Pound

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/91a50790-81b7-4c09-95f6-6c3cada9de83/ee92fd219b6fedffd613c17769c43f58a38fb8ca53aab2ec63f524d4666e456b.jpg)

impacted the 2023 crop quality profile with lower-than-average inshell production and decreased high quality kernel due predominantly to higher moisture levels.

Crop production costs increased  $23.4\%$  due to:

- The increased costs of fertiliser and chemicals due to the Russia Ukraine conflict and lower production levels out of China  
- Increased orchard lease costs due to inflation adjustments and the full recognition of lease costs on orchards reaching full maturity  
Higher labour costs due to market related increases

The above increases were partially offset by lower water prices.

Our almond value-adding operating results delivered an improved result in FY2023. Production rates have increased following the finalisation and commissioning of new equipment implementation. The results were impacted however, by the current low almond price (particularly for low quality product) which has flowed through to lower sales values for value-add finished goods. 2022 crop input stock is forecast to be fully utilised by December 2023.

The Company's balance sheet remains in a sound position with excellent assets. Due to the lower volume of the 2023 crop and the lower quality profile of the 2022 and 2023 crops the level of cash receipts decreased. As a consequence, the Company's net debt position increased to \(190.2m with a gearing level of \(46.2\%\). While this is higher than we would like, the Company's forecast cashflows has us operating within banking limits and a reduction in debt level will follow the harvesting of the 2024 crop.

Reduced available product for shipping, the 2022 and 2023 lower quality crop profiles and lower global almond prices also reduced the Company's operating cashflow to a negative  $8.2 million (FY2022$ 26.8 million). This, plus a further drawdown of debt, funded the year's investing cashflows which were scaled back to operational requirements only. The Company has implemented strategies around customer receipts and supplier payments to increase the velocity of cashflows.

As a result of the Company's FY2023 financial operating result, the Directors have decided to not declare a final dividend.

As the Company looks to enact its strategy, a series of initiatives have been put in place through the establishment of a project management office. Over the course of the year 52 projects were developed of which 26 are ongoing and 12 are completed. The value created from this work to the end of September 2023 was  $8.9m profit and$ 18.5m cash. The value of these gains was consumed by the impact of a lower crop. None the less the project management office has proved an effective means of identifying and creating value.

# Sustainability and Safety

We seek to create value for our shareholders and consider the triple bottom line: the profit we generate from our products, the planet we all live on and the people we rely on to be successful.

This year has seen a substantial and positive improvement in safety results, processes, and practices. We have recorded a  $61\%$  reduction in our total recordable injury frequency rate, demonstrating our people are a clear priority. We also reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by  $25\%$  compared to our 2020-21 baseline and remain committed to become carbon neutral by 2050.

We have taken steps to align our Sustainability Report with the recently released IFRS Sustainability Disclosures and continued to report in reference to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 2021). For the first time this year we are releasing our Sustainability Report alongside our Annual Report and have provided independent assurance over our greenhouse gas emissions data, to ensure its integrity. As a result, we are prepared for emerging mandatory sustainability related disclosures posed by the Australian Government.

Our approach to sustainability supports the global effort to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and we are committed to the continual improvement of our sustainability performance. For more information, visit our Sustainability Report 2023.

# Almond Market Outlook

The global almond price remained sluggish over the FY2023 period. The USDA released their Objective Estimate in July 2023 of 2.6 billion pounds for the US 2023 almond crop. This was higher than industry expectations and prices softened. Consequently, the market held back on buying as they waited to see how the crop developed. As a result, shipment levels were soft, internationally and domestically (USA), which meant carryover stock numbers have not reduced as fast as expected.

The size and quality of the US crop has been the subject of much discussion. California encountered unseasonal cold and wet weather during the final growing periods and the harvest period. Additionally, the industry has encountered a higher prevalence of the Navel Orange Worm, mould and damage. We are starting to see these factors impact the quality profile and size of the US 2023 crop. This is likely to lead to higher pricing for better quality product, particularly Nonpareil and Inshell.

In October 2023 the USDA released their Tree Nuts: World Markets and Trade Report. This report estimates that 2023/24 global demand for almonds will increase by  $6\%$ , outstripping the estimated production levels for the same period.

Based on the current Californian weather related factors and an increase in global demand, almond pricing levels are increasing.

Following the adverse wet conditions over the past two seasons the 2024 crop is progressing well. The trees are in good health and the key milestones of bloom and pollination have both successfully completed. Forecast drier and hotter conditions over the next few months leading into and during harvest will set the Company up for a crop in line with projected expectations for both volume and quality.

# Thank You

During the year Paul Thompson, the previous Managing Director, departed Select Harvests. Appointed to the role in July 2012 Paul substantially grew the Company over 10 years. We would like to acknowledge and thank Paul for his leadership over this period.

The past two years have thrown up numerous challenges for the Company to manage through. The Company's employees have handled these challenges in a professional manner and with unwavering dedication. There have been numerous actions that have been undertaken that will put the Company in a position to benefit when the global almond market returns to its average operating position and crop volumes return to improved growing conditions.

Select Harvests has world class assets and being one of the world's largest vertically integrated almond producers has ensured that the Company has navigated through these recent downward cycles and will be able to capitalise on future upside.

The underlying fundamentals of the almond industry remain positive. Select Harvests is very well placed to benefit from the forecast improved global market pricing and the likelihood of a larger and better quality 2024.

Select Harvests' targeted strategic focus going forward is to increase our volume of almonds, improve our processing scale and efficiency, maximise the return from our crop and innovate to drive step out growth.

We would like to thank our shareholders, customers, suppliers, and employees for all their support and commitment during FY2023 and look forward to continuing to pursue operational improvements and growth opportunities in 2024.

Note: It should be reiterated that, as is always the case at the time the Company develops the crop value estimate, there is the potential for changes to occur both in yield outcomes (as the crop harvest and processing progress) and the pricing environment (driven by almond market or currency) shift.

# CLOSED LOOP COMPOST

Our carbon-based fertiliser is used at scale in our orchards and has the potential to recycle most of our hull waste. We have created a closed loop by using the waste hull ash from the CoGen power plant, which is high in potassium, as an important ingredient to our fertiliser program.

# DIRECTORS' REPORT

(CONTINUED)

# Corporate Information

# Nature of operations and principal activities

The principal activities during the year of entities within the Group were the growing, processing, packaging and sale of almonds and its by-products from company owned and leased almond orchards.

# Employees

The Company employed 476 full time equivalent employees as at 30 September 2023 (30 September 2022: 568 full time equivalent employees).

Full time equivalent employees include: executive, permanent, contractor and seasonal (casual and labour agency hire) employment types.

# Operating and Financial Review

# Overview

Select Harvests is one of the world's largest fully integrated almond companies and the second largest almond producer in Australia. With its core world class assets, the Company is well placed to continue benefit from the global almond macro and growth in the wider better for you plant based foods.

This year Select Harvests has faced a number of challenges that have impacted operations and the financial performance of the Company. The third year of a La Nina weather pattern bought cooler and wetter than average conditions during key growing periods. The impact of this weather pattern led to the Company's 2023 crop being  $38\%$  lower than expectations. This reduction was seen across the Australian almond industry. Additionally, the almond market remained subdued with pricing levels staying predominantly at historic lows.

The focus during FY2023 has been to implement actions through the Project Management Office that drive operating profit and increase cash velocity to manage the Company's debt levels. Implemented actions have delivered material cost reductions, improved efficiencies and improved cash cycle timeframes. At the same the Company has ensured that FY2023 activities have not impacted the potential performance of the 2024 crop.

The Board, Executive, and key leaders remain committed to ensuring all employees remain engaged with driving the Company's strategy to be in a position to capitalise on the forecast 2024 crop improvement and increased global market pricing.

Pleasingly, our safety performance continued to improve with Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate lowering to 6.7 vs 17.1 in FY2022. Safety remains the key focus for the Company with key behaviour change actions currently being imbedded within the Company's operations.

# Horticulture

Heavy rains led to a number of flooding events through October and November 2022. While a number of orchards were impacted, the horticultural team's actions ensured there was minimal damage to infrastructure. These events, in addition to the prolonged cooler weather conditions, impacted yield levels and the quality profile of the 2023 crop.

Additionally, the 2023 crop harvest was impacted by persistent shower activity coupled with below average temperatures. This combination materially impacted harvest activities and subsequently the crop quality profile. Harvested almonds had high moisture content and cooler conditions meant they were on the ground for longer than average periods leading to increased insect damage and instances of mould.

As a consequence of the wetter and cooler conditions across key growing periods, the yields achieved across both mature and immature orchards was significantly lower than average. This was evident across all geographies and the almond industry in general. These impacts led to a 2023 crop of 19,771 MT,  $30.2\%$  lower than the 2022 crop.

Horticultural growing costs increased during the year due predominantly to higher fertiliser and chemical pricing (impacted by the Russia / Ukraine conflict). Most of the other cost categories, with the exception of water, also increased for the 2023 crop.

The forward horticultural focus is yield, costs and quality.

# Processing

Processing was complicated by a lower than average quality profile, due to the lower volume of crop to be processed. Throughput rates were reduced for portions of the crop to ensure the maximum level of product was graded to higher levels of inshell and kernel (attracting higher pricing). We also benefited from the Company's recent investments in state-of-the-art technology over the past 3 - 4 years and the ongoing use of on-farm conditioners. The 2023 crop had been fully hulled and shelled by end of the FY2023 year. The remaining sorting and packing continues and will be completed in the second quarter of FY2024.

Due to the wet harvest conditions impacting the delivered crop, approximately  $25\%$  of the crop had to be mechanically dried prior to the hulling and shelling process. Higher moisture levels once again led to lower levels of inshell produced and a higher percentage of lower grade product.

# DIRECTORS' REPORT

(CONTINUED)

The Carina West processing facility achieved less than  $2\%$  downtime for the year. All repair work following the major fire on Boxing Day in 2021 has been completed and all insurance payments have been received. As part of this process Select Harvests took the opportunity to upgrade and expand its concrete structural footings and implemented state-of-the-art fumigation chambers.

The value-add facility had a number of challenges dealing with a problematic lower grade portion of the 2022 crop (high instances of mould and insect damage). This product has been allocated to specific production runs and as a consequence the value-add facility is now operating at full production and delivering improved yields. Usage of the 2022 crop as input product should be completed by December 2023.

# Sales and Marketing

To date  $83\%$  of the 2023 crop is either shipped or committed for sale.

During FY2023 the Company sold the remainder of its 2022 crop inventory available for external sales (there remains some inventory being used as inputs material for value-add production). Given this product's quality profile it was transacted at low grade manufacturing prices.

The 2023 crop almond price remained flat throughout the year as the market waited to see how the profile of the 2023 US crop eventuated. Given the Company's smaller volume and the lower levels of inshell and high-quality product, options to achieve premium pricing margins were limited.

Demand levels and confidence in buyers committing to increased stocks is improving. However, commitment levels in key export markets still remain below pre-pandemic levels.

The value-add activity's contribution was impacted by to the use of prior period raw material, most of which was very low quality. As finished goods sales prices reduced (in line with the lower almond market) gross margins were negatively impacted. The use of 2022 crop through value-add is scheduled to be completed by December 2023 with 2023 crop being utilised thereafter.

# Costs, Capital and Cashflow

2023 crop costs of production per kg increased by  $73.1\%$  due predominantly to the lower volume of the 2023 crop (i.e. the 2023 growing costs were incurred on a full production basis). Gross production costs increased year on year by  $23.4\%$  due mainly to increased fertiliser and chemical costs, higher bee costs and increased lease costs due to a number of orchards reaching full maturity. Additionally, immature orchards cost recognition increased in line with their age profile with increased yield benefits having been recognised in prior years. Gross processing costs were lower due to the lower crop volume however additional drying costs were again incurred due to the extra moisture levels as a result of the wetter and cooler conditions.

Operational cashflows reduced in FY2023 as a result of a lower volume and quality 2023 crop and the reduction in marketable value of the remaining inventory of the 2022 crop. Additionally, global almond prices remained well below their historical averages. Select Harvests' 2023 inshell levels (which attract premium pricing and generate early cashflows) were lower than average due to the cooler and wetter conditions during the harvest period. The Company produced positive operating cashflows in the second half.

Given the reduced 2023 crop and the ongoing low pricing environment in FY2023, costs and capital expenditure were tightly controlled. No major capital expenditure was undertaken, and no permanent water was acquired.

The combination of a lower 2023 crop volume, crop quality profile and lower global almond pricing environment has led to the Company's debt position increasing to  $190.2M (FY2022$ 134.5M) resulting in a bank debt to equity ratio of 46.2%.

No greenfield activity or acquisitions were undertaken during FY2023. The Company's focus was on organic improvement through efficiency gains and the development of the Project Management Office that has in excess of 50 projects identified to improve profit and/or cashflow.

# Company Profitability

Company revenue from continuing operations of \(206 million was generated for FY2023. This was 12.5% lower than last year mainly due to a lower 2023 crop of 19,771MT (2022: 28,312MT) caused by record rainfall in 2022 and cooler growing conditions across south-east Australia. In addition, a significant portion of the remaining 2022 crop was downgraded during the year due to quality issues primarily related to mould (from exposure to moisture) after a detailed review.

The FY2023 reported loss before interest and taxes (EBIT) of ($149.3) million was $159.4 million lower than FY2022. The lower result was mainly due to:

The 2023 crop volume falling  $34\%$  below the forecast result. This reduction was due to the impact of the La Nina weather pattern impacting 2022 and 2023 growing and harvest conditions. This shortfall was evident across the wider Australian almond industry. Additionally, due to the cooler and wetter climate, the quality profile of the crop was below the Company's average quality mix.  
- Global almond prices remained well below historical averages with the US continuing to lower their levels of carry out inventory. The increased percentage of lower grade crop across US and Australian producers also weighed down the average price. Select Harvests' 2023 crop almond price remained below historical averages at \(6.42/kg.  
- Following a detailed review of the Company's carry forward 2022 inventory, an assessment was made leading to a write down in the value of 2022 inventory and the write-off of volume that was deemed unusable.  
- The write-off of the Group's goodwill balance of  $26 million following an impairment review at the half year-end in addition to a$ 4 million bearer plant write-off caused by flood damage at various orchards;  
- The Value-Add result was impacted due to processing the lower quality 2022 stock which slowed down the operational performance of the plant. Additionally, due to lower almond prices the sales price of finished goods continued to decline. Both factors negatively impacted margins;  
Higher corporate costs as a result of a number of independent reviews conducted across the Company's operations to outline opportunities to improve performance and returns. Additionally, the Company had to close out a number of 2023 hedge positions due to the lower 2023 crop outcome; and  
- Higher interest costs incurred due to higher external debt levels.

# DIRECTORS' REPORT

(CONTINUED)

# Interest Expense

Interest expense of $10.2 million reflects the higher interest rates applicable to current finance facilities and higher average debt levels due to the lower 2023 crop volume, continued lower than average global almond prices and a reduced product quality mix profile.

# Consolidated Statement of Financial Position

Net assets as at 30 September 2023 are \(411.5 million, compared to \)520.3 million as at 30 September 2022. This reduction is due to lower net working capital (resulting from cash improvement initiatives and a lower 2023 crop) and the write-off of goodwill (\(26 million) at the half year-end. Net working capital has decreased by 33.5% mainly due to the reduction in inventory on hand as the Company actively sold its inventory. Additionally, the Company has focussed on increasing the velocity of its sales program during the financial year. Trade and other receivables have reduced due to a focus on reducing customer terms and automation of required documents, particularly for export shipments. Similarly, trade and other payables have increased as the Company has increased its payment terms across a number of suppliers.

# Cash flow and Net Bank Debt

Total net debt as at 30 September 2023 was  $190.2 million (30 September 2022 was$ 134.5 million), with a gearing ratio (total net debt excluding lease liabilities)/equity) of 46.2% (30 September 2022: 25.9%). The increase in borrowings is a result of the reduced 2023 crop leading to a lower volume export sales program and the continuing low global almond price environment (leading to 12 months of sales receipts at $6.42/kg). This was partially offset by management initiatives to improve cash velocity including customer and supplier terms.

Operating cash outflows incurred for FY2023 amounted to  $8.2 million (2022: Inflow of$ 26.8 million). This adverse result was due to operational costs being higher than the sales receipts for the year due to the low volume of the 2023 crop and lower quality profile of the remaining 2022 crop, more than offset by fixed costs related to growing, processing and leasing costs. This result was further hampered by low global almond pricing during the period. The Company delivered a positive operating cashflow of $18.6 million for the second half.

Investing cash outflows of  $26.2 million were$ 9.4 million lower than FY2022. The Company consciously reduced its capital spend in the operating environment. Additionally, as the Company's orchard profile is close to full maturity, costs related to tree development (i.e. capital costs allocated to immature trees) have reduced.

Dividend payments for the year were lower as the final dividend payment relating to the FY2022 result (paid in FY2023) was lower than the FY2021 final dividend paid. Net cash outflow (operating cash, less investing cash, less dividends, less lease principal payments) for FY2023 was $55.7 million which was funded through an increase in bank debt.

# Dividends

Due to the Company's recorded loss, no dividend has been declared for the financial year. This compares to a total dividend of 2 cents per share declared for the previous financial year.

# Business Risks

There are various risks that could have an impact on the achievement of the Company's strategies and future performance.

Set out in the table below are the risks that the Company considers having the greatest possible impact to the business and an outline of what the Company is doing to mitigate these risks.

FY2023 was another extraordinary year for the Company with a third consecutive La Nina weather pattern giving rise to weather volatility impacting both harvest yield, quality and increasing pest and disease pressures. With the impact of geopolitical tensions and uncertainty, global inflation is continuously monitored and where possible managed for its resulting impact on key supply inputs (i.e. fertiliser, etc) across the Company.

<table><tr><td>Risk</td><td>Description</td><td>Mitigation</td></tr><tr><td>People Safety</td><td>The majority of the Company&#x27;s employees work within farm or processing related environments.
The Carina West Processing Facility is a major operating plant that handles the end-to-end process for all of the Company&#x27;s almond and bio-mass inventory.
In addition to the potential harm to any worker, the occurrence of a workplace incident has the potential to harm both the reputation and financial performance of the Company.</td><td>Policies and procedures are designed and are in place in order to minimise the risks of injuries occurring.
Key operating procedures, ongoing capital maintenance, engineering reviews and proactive maintenance are mitigating actions in place to minimise the risk of a safety event (e.g. fire).</td></tr><tr><td>Food Safety 
(including product quality, utilities supply and major equipment failure).</td><td>The Company&#x27;s almond products move to the end consumer through various channels. Quality issues, product contamination or public health issues could damage the Company&#x27;s reputation which could adversely impact the Company&#x27;s financial performance.</td><td>Quality testing procedures are in place at each of the Company&#x27;s processing stages. Additionally, the Company&#x27;s facilities are subject to numerous independent and customer audits to ensure required standards are met.</td></tr><tr><td>Foreign Currency Fluctuations</td><td>The global almond price is determined by the US market in US Dollars. Given the majority of the Company&#x27;s sales are transacted in US dollars, the Company&#x27;s profitability could be negatively impacted by movements in the USD/AUD foreign exchange rate.</td><td>A Treasury and Risk Management policy is in place that ensures the Company&#x27;s foreign exchange exposure is managed in accordance with the crop growing and sales cycle. Additionally, a Treasury Committee meets monthly to monitor and assess the Company&#x27;s foreign exchange exposures.</td></tr><tr><td>Almond Price Decrease</td><td>A key sensitivity to the Company&#x27;s earnings is its exposure to the almond price which is determined by the US market.</td><td>The Company aims to mitigate this risk by maintaining contact with key industry bodies in the US and major traders and customer in key export markets. Crop sales plans are developed each year taking into account pricing factors that impact industry supply and demand. In addition, extensive global marketing and consumer demand drivers get monitored and considered along with global food consumption trends.</td></tr><tr><td>Cyber security</td><td>The Company has numerous IT infrastructure, systems and processes to support the operation and growth of the business. Should such infrastructure, systems and processes fail or become compromised then there is a risk that sensitive or personally identifiable data is accessed or stolen, data is lost, or data and systems are unable to be accessed which may result in reputational damage, legal penalties and ongoing disruptions to operations.</td><td>The Company implements various strategies to mitigate cyber risk across its applications, networks and websites. The Company focusses on employee education, network defence, enterprise wide testing, disaster recovery and segregation of sensitive data. These strategies are internally and externally periodically reviewed, audited and updated.</td></tr></table>

Business Risks (continued)  

<table><tr><td>Risk</td><td>Description</td><td>Mitigation</td></tr><tr><td>Adequate water supply and cost</td><td>Inadequate supply of good quality water, whether due to drought or otherwise, and fluctuating temporary and permanent water prices could impact the Company&#x27;s profitability and operations. Additionally, given increased demand and decreased supply together with the entrance of non-water users, the cost of water could continue to increase and affect the Company&#x27;s profitability.</td><td>The Company has a balance of owned, leased and spot market temporary water. When commercially viable, the Company also invests in permanent water rights in order to manage price and deliverability. The Company has developed a pricing and supply financial model to guide purchase timings and price. The Company further proactively forecasts water usage and availability, and maintains a focus on reducing water usage in growing its crops through continuous investment in water efficient technology. Following a detailed strategic review the Company, when practical will increase the percentage of water it owns.</td></tr><tr><td>Major Facility catastrophe</td><td>A major catastrophic event at the Company&#x27;s Carina West Processing facility including fire/flood or critical equipment failure, resulting in an extended shut down or loss in product could have a significant impact on the Company&#x27;s financial performance.</td><td>To minimise the impacts from a major disruption event, the Company has a Crisis Management Plan which includes a strategy to be followed in the event of a crisis, as well as establishing roles, responsibilities and key activities to be undertaken to effectively manage any type of crisis at the Carina West Processing facility. The Company also reviews and continually assess the adequacy of its insurance cover in place.</td></tr><tr><td>Security of Bee Supply</td><td>The inability of the Company to secure an adequate quality and quantity of bees for pollination of its almond trees could have a significant impact on its crop yield and financial performance.</td><td>The Company continuously engages with the bee keeping industry, the Almond Board and state governments in order to monitor and assess potential risks of supply of bees (i.e. bee disease, etc.). The Company also completes post season analysis of beekeeper performance in order to ensure adequate bee supply numbers are contracted for future crop seasons. During season monitoring of movement of bee keepers within the industry is also carried out in order to ensure adequate supply volumes in future seasons.</td></tr></table>

# DIRECTORS' REPORT

(CONTINUED)

Business Risks (continued)  

<table><tr><td>Risk</td><td>Description</td><td>Mitigation</td></tr><tr><td>Climate and Environment</td><td>Changes in climate (both in Australia and in the United States) present an operating risk to the Company&#x27;s business in the form of weather volatility, water security and crop quality which could have an impact on the Company&#x27;s production assets (farm orchards) and financial performance. 
Risks associated with transitioning to a low-carbon- economy, such as government actions to reduce the impacts of climate change, may also impact the Company&#x27;s operational costs and performance. 
The Company&#x27;s operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, and a range of licences and permits are required for its farming and processing operations. If the Company becomes responsible for any breach of any of its licences or permits, the Company may incur substantial costs, its operations may be interrupted and it may suffer reputational damage.</td><td>The Company&#x27;s diversification of assets across Australia is a key strategy in minimising the impact of physical risk of climate change. This is in addition to continually improving water security and management practices, investing in new water and farming technologies, prioritising the use of integrated pest management and adopting the use of renewable energy sources. 
The Company&#x27;s Board Sustainability Committee oversees strategies relating to horticulture innovation, with one of its areas of focus being the Company&#x27;s adaptation to the impacts of climate change. The Company utilises the TCFD framework as a tool to aid the analysis of the impacts of climate change and is continually developing and implementing strategies to manage the risk. 
The Company continues to assess additional ways to reduce its environmental impact, including measures across its business to improve water usage efficiency and chemical usage. 
The Company also continually reviews its operations to identify ways in which it can minimise the environmental impact of its operations.</td></tr><tr><td>Disruption Event</td><td>Broader disruption events such as a global Pandemic, global conflicts in key strategic regions, geopolitical changes or general prolonged supply chain disruptions could have the potential to have a significant impact on the Company&#x27;s operations.</td><td>The Company maintains a diverse supplier base both domestically and internationally. Additionally, sales and distribution channels are varied to ensure there is not a reliance on any one region. 
The Company is in the process of developing a Crisis Management Plan to enact in the event of a major disruption. This will outline a strategy to be followed including establishing roles, responsibilities and key activities if a major disruption event occurs.</td></tr></table>

# Outlook FY2023

The horticultural program for the 2024 crop is underway and is on schedule with minimal weather-related disruptions. Currently, tree health is positive and showing signs of a strong production rebound after last season's below average result. The trees received their sufficient chill hours through the dormancy period and this was followed by a good bloom period with a positive blossom cycle.

Following the easing of bee movement restrictions related to the prior period NSW varroa mite outbreak, Select Harvests received its full bee requirement across its orchard portfolio. The pollination period was positive with good bee flight hours recorded. The Australian Bee Industry has this year experience a varroa mite outbreak. On the 19th of September 2023 the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry announced that the eradication of the varroa mite was no longer feasible and there will now be a transition to a management phase. This means it is likely that the varroa mite is imbedded within the bee industry and that beekeepers will need to put steps in place to manage their hives. Note that Australia is the last country globally to have the varroa mite within its honeybee populations.

On the 19th of September 2023 the Bureau of Meteorology declared that an El Nino weather pattern was in place. This assumes that conditions in Select Harvests' growing regions will be drier and hotter than average. These forecast conditions are beneficial to almond growing both from a volume and quality perspective.

The impact of the flood events that occurred at the start of FY2023 have been rectified. Impacted wet areas that still had productive trees have been managed appropriately and progressing as planned for the 2024 crop. As a result of the floods, we reviewed our bearer plants and took a $4.1 million write-off.

Based on industry standard yields and the age profile of the orchards, and assuming normal growing conditions for the remainder season, the Select Harvests 2024 theoretical crop would be approximately 30,000MT to 32,000MT.

Ongoing rainfall and full water catchments led to temporary water prices continuing to decrease. With sellers holding off and the announcement of El Nino, temporary water prices increased to close to \(200 per megalitre in September 2023. Recently, prices have started to decline as allocation levels have been released and sellers are coming onto the market. Pricing for fertiliser and chemicals reduced from their FY2022 highs but not to FY2021 pricing. These pricing benefits and the benefits achieved through the Company's cost initiatives have been offset with other cost increases (notably bees and labour) and FY2024 gross cost are expected to be in line with FY2023.

We are forecasting the USD almond price to increase in FY2024. While the US Objective Estimate was released in July 2023 at 2.6 Billion Pounds, the industry is expecting this volume to be lower. In addition to this, the wetter and cooler conditions in California over their key growing and harvest periods is leading to a poor overall quality profile. This is be exacerbated by the presence of the navel orange worm (causing increased insect damage). With an expected lower quality US crop and forecast improved quality 2024 crop for Select Harvests, we expect the ability to capitalise on higher priced inshell and quality kernel products. Levels of enquiry in key export markets is starting to increase indicating that demand levels are returning to pre-pandemic levels.

The Californian 2023 harvest will be completed during November 2023. The key final growing stages and harvest period have been adversely affected by colder and wetter than average conditions. Current indications are that the volume will be potentially less than the Objective Estimate with quality negatively impacted by high moisture levels and increased insect damage through a higher presence of the navel orange worm.

While pricing to date remains at lower than long term average levels, the past two months have shown incremental weekly increases particularly for inshell and higher-grade kernel.

The Select Harvests' team continues to focus on improving efficiency, managing costs and optimising the 2024 crop volume and quality. In the second half of FY2024 the Company will commence the installation of a pre-cleaner and drier. This will allow for the processing of almonds efficiently and deliver an improved quality profile during wetter than average seasons.

Based on the factors above, the Company's cashflow forecasts indicate it will operate within its current lending limits and meet its required covenant measures.

Other key projects currently being progressed are:

- Increased capacity of the Company's Carina West processing facility - a review of the facility has been completed that has identified a number of areas of improvement and minor capital investment to increase the throughput of the plant by  $15\% - 20\%$ . This increase in processing capacity will be utilised in FY2024.  
- Pre-cleaning and drying capacity - the Company will be investing in a new large scale pre-cleaner and dryer. This will ensure that if there is product with high moister levels it can cleaned and dried earlier in the cycle and continue to be processed efficiently and maintain a higher quality profile.  
- Expansion of compost production and commercialisation – the Company currently produces in excess of 40,000 tonnes of compost (from orchard waste, ash produced from its biomass energy plant and some external additives). This option reduces the requirement for fertilizer, improves soil structure and health and promotes the transfer of carbon from the atmosphere in soil.  
- The Sustainability Report will be published in November 2023.  
- The Company continues to investigate organic and strategic growth opportunities such as:

- Continued expansion in almond orchards, both greenfield and mature  
- Increasing its level of processing capacity and sourcing of external grower volumes  
- Diversification into other nuts and services  
- Increased new product development in almond value-add processes.

# Outlook FY2023 (continued)

In summary, FY2023 was a challenging year. The materially impacted crop through a third La Nina period, in addition to a continued below average global pricing environment has led to a large financial operating loss. The Company has managed this period well by ensuring operating costs were as low as possible and cash velocity increasing. The global outlook for the almond industry and 'better for you' plant-based foods remains very strong. Select Harvests has high quality assets, a sustainable and increasingly efficient production profile supported by world class technology. The Company remains well placed to deliver on the opportunities that will arise from the demand growth globally for almonds.

# REMUNERATION REPORT

# Introduction from the Chair of the Remuneration Committee

On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the 2023 Remuneration Report, marking my second year as Chair of the Board Remuneration and Nomination Committee. The past year has presented a series of challenges and notable events for the Select Harvests team. Local and global factors have continued to impact our business, our people, and our communities. Despite the challenging operating environment we've faced over the past year, the resilience demonstrated by our staff and the communities in which they operate have been remarkable. As we enter a new phase of leadership our commitment remains focused on the safety and well-being of our staff and continued dedication to being a respected member of the local communities in which we operate.

The objective of Select Harvests' remuneration strategy is to attract, retain and motivate the people we require to drive forward business improvement and growth opportunities. Executive remuneration packages include a balance of fixed remuneration, short term cash incentives and long-term equity incentives. The framework endeavours to align executive reward with market conditions and shareholders' interests.

Fixed remuneration is aligned to the market mid-point for similar roles in comparable companies.

The health and well-being of our people remains the paramount priority for the business, with the short-term incentive payments conditional on the foundations being in place for a safe work environment, evidenced through our tollgates and an increase in percentage on our safety KPI. It is essential that we continue to demonstrate and build on our strong safety culture and our values.

The short-term incentive program is based on annual performance and is evaluated against key performance indicators (KPIs) with financial, individual and operational targets. The performance targets are based on the annual business plan and set at a level that allows for a  $50\%$  payout on achieving a challenging yet realistically attainable level of performance. The maximum payout is only realised when an exceptional level of performance is demonstrated across all KPIs. In addition to KPIs for their respective business units and areas of direct responsibility, all Key Management Personnel (KMP) share a company NPAT and Safety KPI to encourage a strong executive team dynamic and cross business unit collaboration.

Setting KPIs for agriculture dependent business presents a challenge due to various factors such as climatic conditions, commodity prices and exchange rates having a significant effect on results. While management can to some degree mitigate these "agricultural risks" and should be encouraged to do so, there are elements out of our control. The Board retains some discretion in evaluating overall performance and taking into account operating conditions. KMP STI vesting levels ranged from  $25\%$  to  $41\%$  of the maximum opportunity.

The FY2023 long-term incentive plan has been adjusted to focus on two key areas that relate to the delivery of strategic sustainable growth in shareholder value over the medium and longer terms. These are:

-  $50\%$  weighting to Absolute TSR (CAGR) over the performance measurement period (range between  $5\%$  and  $20\%$ )  
- 50% weighting to Pre-Tax Average ROCE over the measurement period (range between 7.0% and 14.0%)

In the context of prior period vesting assessment, based on historical performance metrics, the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) for the preceding three-year performance period registered a negative  $24.2\%$ . This placed the Company at the 30th percentile within its peer group and, consequently, no rights vested.

The remuneration outcomes resulting from the FY2023 performance are set out in this Remuneration Report.

# Who and how much did you pay your Key Management Personnel for the financial year (non IFRS)?

Key Management Personnel (KMP), as defined, encompasses individuals with the authority and responsibility for planning, directing, and overseeing an entity's activities, whether directly or indirectly, including any Director, whether executive or non-executive, of that entity. This year, a comprehensive review of KMP was conducted to ensure that KMP reporting aligns with the definition.

Consequently, there has been a reduction in the number of KMP, and our reporting now includes those who are responsible for governing and overseeing the activities of our entity.

1. STI will be paid after the FY2023 financial statements have been approved.  
2. The vested performance rights value in this table has been determined using the closing share price on the last trading day of FY23. Vesting occurs after the finalisation and approval of the FY2023 financial statements and hurdle testing is completed by an independent expert. Sale of shares emanating from vested performance rights under the current plan are subject to a holding lock which requires Executive KMPs to accumulate and hold a value equivalent to  $50\%$  of their annual TFR.

# When is remuneration earned and received?

The remuneration components are structured to reward executives progressively across different timeframes. The diagram below shows the period over which FY2023 remuneration was received and when the awards was granted and vested.

STI payments are based on a maximum of  $80\%$  for the MD and  $50\%$  for other Executive KMP of the fixed remuneration, with maximum payment on achievement of a stretching but achievable target, with regard to past and otherwise expected achievements.

LTI grants are at face value, where face value represents the share pricing at 30 September 2023.

# What performance rights were granted for year ended 30 September 2023?

Equity was granted to the MD and Other KMP in FY2023, as detailed in the table below. The methodology used for the allocation was determined using the face value of full vesting based on the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) over the 10 days preceding the date of 27 February 2023 Annual General Meeting.

# Is there alignment between management and shareholder interests?

The Board's decision to give KMP's a higher STI in 2023 is a strategic move to better align management with shareholder interests. This acknowledges the complexity of executive roles and emphasises a performance-focused culture that directly benefits the Company and its shareholders in the long run. The Board is confident that this compensation structure strikes the right balance between risk and reward, enhancing shareholder value through leadership and strategic execution.

# 2. MD AND OTHER KMP REMUNERATION

# 2.1 How STI outcomes are linked to performance

At the commencement of each annual operating cycle the Board sets KPIs for the MD and the MD sets KPIs for the KMP with target levels of performance based on the Board approved annual operating plan. At the end of the operating cycle the Board assesses actual performance against these KPIs based on full year final financial and operating results and metrics. Actual performance against reported results and related metrics determines the STI reward.

The FY2023 financial and operating results and related metrics resulted in KMP STI rewards as a percentage of TFR of  $21.4\%$ . This evaluation reflects a company that experienced financial challenges. Nonetheless, the individuals showed dedication to minimise the loss and implement improvements through a challenging year.

The individual KMP actual STI payments and potential maximum payments are set out in the following table in section 2.3.

# 2.3 What we paid to MD and Other KMP in FY2023 - Further detail

The following pages compare the maximum potential and actual remuneration for the financial year ended 30 September 2023 for current KMP. Amounts include:

- Total fixed remuneration  
STI achieved as a result of business and individual performance (versus the maximum potential STI)  
- Share performance rights that vested during the year at face value (versus the maximum initial award face value) for the performance testing period concluding in that year.

This information differs from the statutory remuneration disclosures presented in Section 5.1 (which are presented in accordance with the accounting standards) as the performance rights value is based on the closing share price on the day the tranche of performance rights were approved. The directors believe that the remuneration received is more relevant to users for the following reasons:

The statutory remuneration expensed is based on historic cost and does not reflect the value of the equity instruments when they are actually received by the KMPs  
- The statutory remuneration shows benefits before they are actually received by the KMPs

# 2.4 FY2024 Outlook

The Remuneration and Nomination Committee and Board continue to review our remuneration strategy:

The 2024 STI KPIs focus on priorities and outcomes budgeted for as part of annual business plans, maintaining the focus on safety, financial metrics, cost of production and culture.  
Our LTI performance rights are allocated annually, ensuring closer alignment to current strategic plans and financial targets.  
- The focus of LTI moves to delivery of strategic sustainable growth in shareholder value over the medium and longer terms. Performance metrics: Absolute TSR (50% weighting) and absolute ROCE (50% weighting).

# 2.6 Terms of KMP Service Agreements

Remuneration and other terms of employment for the KMP are formalised in service agreements. These service agreements set out the base salary arrangements and future review. Each of these agreements provide for participation in a Short Term Incentive Plan and a Long Term Incentive Plan.

# 3. NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' ARRANGEMENTS

On appointment to the Board, all Non-Executive Directors enter into a service agreement with the Company in the form of a letter of appointment. The letter summarises the Board policies and terms, including compensation, relevant to the office of Director. On 1st November 2023, P van Heerwaarden joined the Board as a non-executive Director.

Non-Executive Directors receive fees (including statutory superannuation) but do not receive any performance related remuneration nor are they issued options or performance rights on securities. This reflects the responsibilities and the Group's demands of directors. Non-Executive Directors' fees are periodically reviewed by the Board to ensure that they are appropriate and in line with market expectations.

Non-Executive Directors' professional development is supported and funded through the Company's training budget. There is no equity ownership requirement for Non-Executive Directors. Directors are encouraged to acquire and hold shares equivalent in value to their annual fees.

The current aggregate fee limit of  $973,750 was approved by shareholders at the 25 February 2022 Annual General Meeting. For the FY2023 year, the total amount paid to Non-Executive Directors was$ 693,665.

The remuneration is a base fee with the Chair of each of the Committee receiving additional fees commensurate with their responsibilities. The current directors' fees are as follows:

<table><tr><td colspan="2">Current Base Fees (including superannuation)</td></tr><tr><td>Chair</td><td>$252,216</td></tr><tr><td>Other Non-Executive Directors</td><td>$109,737</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Additional Fees (including superannuation)</td></tr><tr><td>Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee</td><td>$14,633</td></tr><tr><td>Chair of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee</td><td>$14,633</td></tr><tr><td>Chair of the Sustainability Committee</td><td>$14,633</td></tr></table>

During the financial year ended 30 September 2023, no remuneration advisors were engaged. This assessment occurs on a biannual cycle.

# Notes

It should be noted that performance rights granted, referred to in the remuneration details set out in this report, comprise a proportion of rights which have not yet vested and are reflective of rights that may or may not vest in future years.

The elements of remuneration have been determined based on the cost to the consolidated entity.

Performance rights granted have been independently valued using the Black-Scholes-Merton model and the Monte Carlo simulation option pricing model, which takes account of factors such as the exercise price of the rights, the current level and volatility of the underlying share price and the time to maturity of the rights. The amount shown here is an accounting expense and reflects the value as determined using this model. The value is expensed over the vesting period of the rights.

P Ross and N Feder were no longer a KMP as at 1 October 2022. Their balance at that date were 56,403 and 27,058 respectively.

All vested rights are exercisable after the performance period, subject to a holding lock that requires KMP to hold shares with a value equivalent to their base salary.

The LTI Plan provides for the offer of a parcel of performance rights with a three year performance period to participating employees. The rights vest at the end of the period on achievement of the performance hurdles. Performance rights are granted under the plan for no consideration.

The plan rules contain a restriction on removing the 'at risk' aspect of the instruments granted to executives. Plan participants may not enter into any transaction designed to remove the 'at risk' aspect of an instrument before it vests.

+ As these Directors and employees are no longer with the Company, the number of shares held by them are no longer reported and therefore removed from the table. P Ross and N Feder were no longer a KMP as at 1 October 2022. Their balance at that date were 168,498 and Nil respectively.

# 1. BASIS OF PREPARATION

# 1.1 Basis of Preparation

The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated. The consolidated financial statements are for Select Harvests Limited and its subsidiaries ('the Group').

This general purpose financial report has been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards, other authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board ('AASB') and the Corporations Act 2001. Select Harvests Limited is a for profit entity which is incorporated and domiciled in Australia. Its registered office and principal place of business is:

Select Harvests Limited

L3, Building 7, Botanica Corporate Park

570-588 Swan Street

Richmond VIC 3121

A description of the nature of the Company's operations and its principal activities is included in the review of operations in the directors' report, which is not part of this financial report.

The financial report was authorised for issue by the directors on 24 November 2023. The Company has the power to amend and reissue the financial report.

Through the use of the internet, we have ensured that our corporate reporting is timely, complete, and available globally at minimum cost to the Company. All financial reports and other information are available on our website: https://www.selectharvests.com.au.

# Compliance with IFRS

The consolidated financial statements of the Group comply with International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS') as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB').

# Historical cost convention

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets, financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and biological assets.

# Critical accounting estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with Australian equivalents to IFRS ('AIFRS') requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Company's accounting policies. The areas involving a higher level of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 1.2.

# New or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations adopted during the financial year

The Group has adopted all of the new or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the AASB that are mandatory for the current reporting year. These do not have a material effect on the Group's consolidated financial statements.

Any new, revised or amended Accounting Standards or Interpretations that are not yet mandatory have not been early adopted.

# New standards and interpretations not yet adopted

Certain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for the 30 September 2023 reporting period and have not been early adopted by the Group. The Group's assessment of these new standards and interpretations concluded that they will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group in future periods. The new standards and interpretations are as follows:

- AASB 2020-1 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards- Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current (effective years beginning after 1 January 2023)  
- AASB 2020-6 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards- Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current - Deferral of effective date (effective years beginning after 1 January 2023)  
- AASB 2021-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards- Disclosure of Accounting Policies and Definition of Accounting Estimates (effective years beginning after 1 January 2023)  
- AASB 2021-5 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards-Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (effective years beginning after 1 January 2023)  
- AASB 2022-1 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards- Initial Application of AASB17 and AASB 9 (effective years beginning after 1 January 2023)

# New sustainability reporting standards

In June 2023 the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) published two sustainability reporting standards in response to the demand for better information about sustainability related matters.

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(CONTINUED)

# 1.1 Basis of preparation (continued)

The standards issued were:

IFRS S1 "General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information". IFRS S1 sets out overall requirements with the objective to require an entity to disclose information about its sustainability-related risks and opportunities that is useful to the primary users of general purpose financial reports in making decisions relating to providing resources to the entity.  
IFRS S2 "Climate-related Disclosures". IFRS S2 sets out the requirements for identifying, measuring and disclosing information about climate-related risks and opportunities that is useful to primary users of general purpose financial reports in making decisions relating to providing resources to the entity.

The Australian climate related financial disclosure requirements are still being finalised, however disclosures are expected to be closely aligned with the ISSB Standards, with Australian equivalents to be set by the AASB considering Australian-specific requirements. Based on the current proposals, the climate related disclosure requirements are expected to first apply to the Group for the financial year ending 30 September 2025.

Whilst there are currently no mandatory climate related reporting requirements, the Group recognises the importance of environmental and social matters to its shareholders, suppliers and customers and discloses a significant amount of information on these topics in its Annual Sustainability Report. The Group's 2023 Sustainability Report has been released to the ASX at the same time as this report and can be found on the Company's website at https://www.selectharvests.com.au/governance/

# Principles of consolidation

# (i) Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. A list of the Group's subsidiaries is included in note 5.1.

Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between the Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.

# Foreign currency translation

# (i) Functional and presentation currency

Items included in the consolidated financial statements of each entity comprising the Company are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates ("the functional currency"). The consolidated financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, which is the functional and presentation currency of the Group.

# (ii) Transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges.

# Restatement of comparative information

# (a) Revenue recognition for sale of external grower almonds

During the financial year, the Group assessed the revenue recognition policy for the sale of almonds received for processing from external growers. Previously, revenue had been recognised assuming the Group was acting as an agent, however the recent assessment concluded that the Group was acting as a principal in the arrangement. The error resulted in a material understatement of Total Revenue recognised for the 2022 and prior financial years and a corresponding understatement in Cost of sales. This restatement did not impact Net Profit. Additionally, there was an understatement of Inventory and Trade and other payables. There was no impact on equity.

# (b) Unwinding of fair value margin recognised on crops harvested in prior periods

Almond crops are accounted for as a biological asset and measured at fair value. In prior years, the fair value margin recognised on almond crops when harvested and transferred to inventory was reversed when the almonds were sold through the Fair value adjustment of biological assets line. Going forward the fair value movement and cost of sales will be recognised at their respective gross amounts, with the reversal of the fair value adjustment not recognised through the Fair value adjustment of biological assets line. There was not an impact on Net Profit. For the year ended 30 September 2022, the amount of $29.77m has been reclassified to increase Cost of sales with a corresponding adjustment in the Fair value adjustment of Biological assets.

# Comparatives

Where necessary, comparatives have been reclassified and repositioned for consistency with current year disclosures.

# Rounding

The amounts contained in this report and in the financial report have been rounded to the nearest $1,000 (where rounding is applicable) under the option available to the Company under ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/ Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191. The Company is an entity to which the Class Order applies.

# Parent entity financial information

The financial information for the parent entity, Select Harvests Limited, disclosed in Note 5.2 has been prepared on the same basis as the consolidated financial statements, except as set out below.

# (i) Investments in subsidiaries

Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost in the consolidated financial statements of Select Harvests Limited.

# 1.2. Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements

The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future about uncertain external factors such as: discount rates, the effects of inflation, the outlook for global and local almond market supply and demand conditions, foreign exchange rates, asset useful lives and climate-related risks such as heat waves, droughts and floods.

Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors. The actual outcomes of estimates and judgements used may differ because of changes in these estimates and judgements.

The estimates and judgements that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.

# 1.2.1 Climate related risks

Consideration has been given to climate related risks throughout the consolidated financial statements, and in particular in respect of the short-term impacts of climate conditions impacting forecast future cash flows and the carrying value of biological assets and the longer term climate impacts on the caring value of non-current assets, including orchard valuations (owned and leased) and water entitlements.

Climate risks most likely to affect the Group financially include floods and droughts, given the dependency on the use of water on its orchards. The financial impact of increasing/decreasing water costs as a result of droughts/floods, will most likely be offset by changes in almond prices given drier conditions usually increase almond quality and quantities and vice versa.

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(CONTINUED)

# 1.2. Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgement (continued)

The effect of these two extreme weather events on the Group's Net Profit After Tax (NPAT) are summarised below:

<table><tr><td></td><td colspan="2">Floods</td><td colspan="2">Drought</td></tr><tr><td>Temporary Water Price</td><td>↓</td><td></td><td>↑</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Product quality</td><td>↓</td><td>% Inshell lower &amp; higher manufacturing grade</td><td>↑</td><td>% Kernel &amp; inshell higher &amp; manufacturing grade lower</td></tr><tr><td>Harvesting cost</td><td>↑</td><td>Labour, weed spraying &amp; chemicals</td><td>↓</td><td>Labour, chemicals</td></tr><tr><td>Processing cost</td><td>↑</td><td>Drying</td><td>↓</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Pricing</td><td colspan="4">Better or worse growing conditions in Australia due to extreme weather conditions will have a significant impact on global almond prices. Extreme weather conditions in California will dictate global almond commodity prices.</td></tr></table>

The financial impact of increasing temporary water costs because of drier conditions will be offset by lower harvest and processing costs as well as a higher % of inshell and kernel production and visa versa.

# 1.2.2 Going concern

The Group's operating loss before tax result of \(159.5m for the financial year resulted from a downgrade in quality of the 2022 crop, lower almond pricing, high operating costs and poor bloom and growing conditions impacting the net volume of the 2023 crop.

As a result of these challenges, the Board and management have considered the Group's ability to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months from the date the consolidated financial statements are issued ("forecast period").

As of 30 September 2023, the Group has non-current bank debt of  $185.0 million and current debt of$ 6.3 million.

During the financial year, the Group successfully secured credit approval for an increase in banking facilities, adjusted covenants (refer note 4.3) and incorporating the seasonal facility into its overall banking facility. The Group was in compliance with the revised covenants for the period ending 30 September 2023.

The Group has reviewed its cash flow forecast and its ability to operate within the net debt limit for the forecast period. In undertaking this review, the Group considered the critical assumptions in relation to the forecast and performed a sensitivity analysis on the forecast cash flows.

The Group's forecast cash flows include critical assumptions relating to crop quality, crop volume and almond pricing and operating costs.

# Crop volumes and pricing

A critical assumption is the 2024 crop volume. The cash flow includes the assumption of the 2024 crop tonnage returning to historical average harvest volumes and quality profile, and an increase of at least  $15\%$  on the 2023 crop almond price.

The increase in the almond price is on the basis of a significant increase in quality and resulting increase in the inshell portion of the crop sales, alongside upward movements in market pricing. There are a number of positive indicators for almond pricing and positive upward movement in recent contracted sales.

# Operating costs

The forecast includes the impact of inflationary increases on input costs, offset by cost savings related to key input costs such as fertiliser.

# Sensitivity of cash flows

The Group has considered the downside scenarios of changes to almond pricing and volumes. Based on downside scenarios, the Group is satisfied that reasonable changes to key assumptions would not create a liquidity issue.

If the sales volume and pricing were to adversely impact the cash flow, the Group has other cash flow initiatives to maintain the headroom in the debt facilities. These include divestment of certain assets (e.g. water) and other cost saving initiatives and business efficiency projects.

# Compliance with forecast covenants

The Group's Fixed Charge Cover ('FCC') ratio will be tested for the period ended 31 March 2024 and 30 September 2024. The compliance with the FCC ratio will be based on the estimated profit for the FY2024 crop. There is limited headroom in the forecast FCC covenant for the FY24 testing dates, and hence any downside change to the forecast almond price, quality of the harvest or the forecast tonnage could result in a breach of the FCC covenant in FY24. The FCC ratio is sensitive to changes in the 2024 crop forecast. A change in the 2024 crop almond price assumption of  $5.6\%$  or a drop in yield of  $5.6\%$  would result in a FCC covenant ratio breach at 31 March 2024.

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(CONTINUED)

# 1.2. Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgement (continued)

Based on this analysis the Group would continue to trade within the limits of the available funding facilities and comply with financial covenants throughout the going concern forecast period. It has been concluded that the Group will continue to operate as a going concern and as a result, the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on this basis.

# Other Critical accounting estimates and assumptions include:

Inventory - Valuation of the 2023 Almond Crop: refer note 3.2 Inventories

Carrying value of biological assets: refer note 3.3 Biological Assets

Carrying value of non-current assets: refer note 3.5 Property, Plant and Equipment, note 3.6 Right-Of-Use Assets and 3.7 Intangibles

* Refer to note 1.1 Basis of Preparation for details of the restatement of comparative information.  
a. Revenue from the Sale of goods includes sales of value-added almond products of  $44.2m (2022:$ 55.8m) and non value-added products of  $\$159.2m$  (2022:  $\$137.6m$ ).  
b. A government grant of  $\$ {0.12}$  million was received during the year for hull digestion plant purposes (2022: $0.07 million).

# Revenue Recognition

Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Amounts disclosed as revenue are net of returns, trade allowances, and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Revenue is recognised when performance obligations are satisfied and control of the goods or services have passed or been provided to the buyer. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised:

# Sale of goods and services

Revenue is recognised in respect of the sale of goods at the point in time when control over the corresponding goods is transferred to the customer (i.e. at a point in time for sale of goods when the goods are shipped to the customer or when the services have been provided). Revenue from sale of goods includes revenue where the Group sells almonds purchased from external growers. The Group is considered to be a principal in the sale of almonds purchased from external growers, given the Group has control over the external grower inventory from the time of delivery to the Group through to ultimate sale to customers.

Revenue is collected on behalf of shipping and insurance third parties in instances where there are freight and insurance services incorporated into the sales contract. The promise to arrange shipping and insurance on behalf of the customer is identified as a separate performance obligation from the promise to sell the associated almonds. The nature of this performance obligation is to provide agency services, arranging the shipping and insurance on behalf of the customer, and accordingly revenue is recognised on a net basis.

# Management services

Management services revenue relates to services provided for the management and development of farms as well as sub leasing of our non-almond orchard. The services are recognised as revenue when services are provided.

All revenue is stated net of the amount of Goods and Services Tax (GST).

# Government grants

Government grants are assistance by the government in the form of transfers of resources to the Group in return for past or future compliance with certain conditions relating to the operating activities of the Group.

Government grants relating to income are recognised as income over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs. Government grants that are receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred or for the purpose of giving immediate financial support to the Group with no future related costs are recognised as income of the period in which they become receivable.

Government grants whose primary condition is that the Group should purchase, construct or otherwise acquire non-current assets are deducted from the carrying amount of the asset on the consolidated Statement of Financial Position. The grant is recognised in profit or loss over the life of the depreciable asset as a reduced depreciation expense.

The income tax expense or revenue for the year is the tax payable on the current year's taxable income based on the notional income tax rate adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, and to unused tax losses.

# (i) Investment allowances and similar tax incentives

Companies within the Group may be entitled to claim special tax deductions for investments in qualifying assets or in relation to qualifying expenditure (e.g. the Research and Development Tax Incentive regime in Australia or other investment allowances). The Group accounts for such allowances as tax credits, which means that the allowance reduces income tax payable and current tax expense. A deferred tax asset is recognised for unclaimed tax credits that are carried forward.

- Receivables and payables are stated with the amount of GST included.

The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

Cash flows are included in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on a gross basis and the GST component of cash flows arising from investing and financing activities, which is recoverable from, or payable to the taxation authority are classified as Cash Flows from Operating Activities.

# Trade Receivables

Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. They are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Details about the Company's impairment policies and the calculation of the loss allowance are explained below.

# (a) Impairment of trade receivables

The Group applies the AASB 9 Financial Instruments simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables.

To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period of 24 months before 30 September 2023 and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables.

The ageing analysis for the financial year ended 2023 was determined as follows:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Current $&#x27;000</td><td>Up to 3 months past due $&#x27;000</td><td>More than 3 months past due $&#x27;000</td><td>Total $&#x27;000</td></tr><tr><td>30 September 2023</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Gross carrying amount</td><td>32,302</td><td>(15)</td><td>-</td><td>32,287</td></tr><tr><td>30 September 2022</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Gross carrying amount</td><td>34,177</td><td>(313)</td><td>-</td><td>33,864</td></tr></table>

Note: Expected credit loss on aged receivables is immaterial and not disclosed above.

# (b) Effective interest rates and credit risk

All receivables are non-interest bearing.

The Company minimises concentrations of credit risk in relation to trade receivables by undertaking transactions with a large number of customers from across the range of business segments in which the Company operates. Refer to Note 4.4 for more information on the risk management policy of the Company as well as the effective interest rate and credit risk of current receivables.

# (c) Fair value

Due to the short-term nature of these receivables, their carrying amount is assumed to approximate their fair value.

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(CONTINUED)

# 3.2 Inventories (continued)

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. A write-down of \(24.5m (2022: Nil) was made for the 2022 crop due to deterioration in stock quality during the financial year.

A fair value write down was recognised on the 2023 almond crop in biological assets (note 3.3). There have been no subsequent write-downs to the 2023 crop after being transferred into inventory.

Almond inventory held at 30 September 2023 that has been purchased from external growers is included in the Group's Inventory balance given the Group has control over the external grower inventory from the time of delivery to ultimate sale to customers.

Costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition, are accounted for as follows:

- Raw materials and consumables: purchase cost on a first in first out basis;

- Biological assets reclassified as inventory (included within raw materials in the table above): the initial cost assigned to agricultural produce is the fair value less costs to sell at the point of harvesting in accordance with AASB 141 Agriculture ('AASB 141').

Subsequently, downward changes to the fair value of uncommitted inventory are recognised to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. The fair value measurements for the uncommitted inventory balance have been categorised as Level 2 fair values based on the inputs to the valuation techniques used, which are based on observable market data. It is measured considering the estimated selling price at any given point in time based on:

- current market prices for similar quality products i.e. inshell/kernel, etc;  
- executed sales of similar quality product in the market; and  
- The observable data used for measurement of the uncommitted inventory balance are inherently considering the impact of climate change risks at the time of measurement including any climate related impacts on the size of the Californian almond crop;

Finished goods and work in progress: cost of direct material and labour and a proportion of manufacturing overheads based on normal operating capacity; and  
- Other inventories comprise consumable stocks of chemicals, fertilisers and packaging materials recorded at cost on a first in first out basis.

# Critical Accounting Estimates & Assumptions

# Valuation of the 2023 Almond Crop

The 2023 almond crop is classified as inventory once the crop is harvested in accordance with AASB 102 Inventories. At balance date, the Company had completed hulling and shelling of all its almonds with a yield of 19,771MT and  $83\%$  of this crop had been sold or committed to be sold.

At 30 September 2023, \(45.8 million of the Groups' inventory is in relation to the 2023 almond crop.

The critical accounting estimates and assumptions used in determining the net realisable value of the 2023 uncommitted inventory on hand includes the quality of the inventory on hand, and its associated market pricing. It also considers any subsequent contracts entered into after year end.

# Recognition and Measurement

Almond trees are bearer plants and are therefore presented and accounted for as property, plant and equipment ('PPE') (see note 3.5). However, almonds growing on the trees are accounted for as biological assets until the point of harvest. Almonds are transferred to inventory at fair value less costs to sell when harvested (see note 3.2). Biological assets relate to the almond crop and are measured at fair value less costs to sell in accordance with AASB141. Where fair value cannot be reliably measured or little or no biological transformation has taken place, biological assets are measured at cost.

At 30 September 2023, the biological asset balance relates to the 2024 almond crop, which is recorded at cost and has little or no biological transformation. The 2023 almond crop has been transferred to inventory after it was fully harvested during the financial year.

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(CONTINUED)

# 3.3 Biological Assets (continued)

The change in estimated fair value of the biological assets are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Fair value measurements have been categorised as Level 3 fair values based on the inputs to the valuation techniques used, which are not based on observable market data. It is measured taking into account the following:

estimated selling price at harvest and estimated cash inflows based on forecasted sales;  
estimated yields; and  
estimated remaining growing, harvests, processing and selling costs.

All the non-observable data used for measurement of the biological assets fair value, are inherently considering the impact of climate change risks at the time of measurement including for example the impact of severe weather conditions on water requirements to grow and harvests the almond crops.

# Critical Accounting Estimates & Assumptions

# Carrying value of biological assets

The recoverability of the biological assets carrying value is dependent on the estimated 2024 crop volume and price. The Group's forecasts include the assumption of the 2024 crop tonnage returning to historical average harvest volumes and quality profile, and an increase of at least  $15\%$  on the 2023 crop almond price. These estimates incorporate the consideration of short-term climate related risks and assumptions as set out in Note 1.2.1.

The increase in the almond price is based on a significant increase in quality and resulting increase in the in-shell portion of the crop sales, alongside upward movements in market pricing. There are a number of positive indicators for almond pricing and positive upward movement in recent contracted sales.

# Derivatives

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Company designates derivatives as either; (1) hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment (fair value hedge); or (2) hedges of highly probable forecast transactions (cash flow hedges).

# (i) Hedge effectiveness

Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument. The Company documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.

For hedges of foreign currency purchases and sales, the Company enters into hedge relationships where the critical terms of the hedging instrument match exactly with the terms of the hedged item. The Company therefore performs a qualitative assessment of effectiveness. If changes in circumstances affect the terms of the hedged item such that the critical terms no longer match exactly with the critical terms of the hedging instrument, the Company uses the hypothetical derivative method to assess effectiveness. Ineffectiveness may arise if the timing of the forecast transaction changes from what was originally estimated or if there are changes in the credit risk.

In hedges of foreign currency purchases and sales, ineffectiveness may arise if the timing of the forecast transaction changes from what was originally estimated, or if there are changes in the credit risk of Australia or the derivative counterparty.

# (ii) Fair value hedge

Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.

# (iii) Cash flow hedge

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve within equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in Other Expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(CONTINUED)

# 3.4 Derivative Financial Instruments (continued)

# (iv) Cash flow hedge accounting

When option contracts are used to hedge forecast transactions, the Company designates intrinsic value options as the hedging instrument. Gains and losses relating to the effective portion of the change in value of the options are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve within equity.

When forward exchange contracts ('FEC's) are used to hedge forecast transactions, the Company designates the full change in fair value of the forward exchange contract('FEC') as the hedging instrument. The gains or losses relating to the effective portion of the change in fair value of the entire FEC are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve within equity.

Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified in Cost of Sales in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss (for instance when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset (for example, inventory) or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the measurement of the initial cost or carrying amount of the asset or liability.

When a hedging instrument expires or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative deferred gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to Other Expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

# (v) Outstanding hedge instruments

The Company entered into FEC's hedge instruments to buy and sell specified amounts of foreign currency in the future at stipulated exchange rates. The objective of entering the FEC's is to protect the Company against unfavourable exchange rate movements for highly probable contracted and forecasted sales and purchases undertaken in foreign currencies.

At balance date, the details of outstanding hedge instruments are:

<table><tr><td></td><td colspan="2">Buy Australian Dollars</td><td colspan="2">Average Exchange Rate</td></tr><tr><td>Less than 6 months</td><td>2023 $&#x27;000</td><td>2022 $&#x27;000</td><td>2023 $&#x27;000</td><td>2022 $&#x27;000</td></tr><tr><td>FEC Sell USD Settlement</td><td>USD66,693</td><td>USD74,687</td><td>0.67</td><td>0.72</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan="2">Buy Australian Dollars</td><td colspan="2">Average Exchange Rate</td></tr><tr><td>More than 6 months</td><td>2023 $&#x27;000</td><td>2022 $&#x27;000</td><td>2023 $&#x27;000</td><td>2022 $&#x27;000</td></tr><tr><td>FEC Sell USD Settlement</td><td>USD30,000</td><td>USD47,500</td><td>0.65</td><td>0.68</td></tr><tr><td>Option Sell USD Settlement</td><td>USD10,000</td><td>-</td><td>0.67</td><td>-</td></tr></table>

# (vi) Credit risk exposures

Credit risk for derivative financial instruments arises from the potential failure by counterparties to the contract to meet their obligations at maturity. The credit risk exposure to FEC's is the net fair values of these instruments.

The net amount of the foreign currency the Group will be required to pay or purchase when settling the brought forward foreign currency contracts should the counterparty not pay the currency it is committed to deliver to the Group at balance date was USD  $106,693,000 (2022: USD$ 122,186,522).

The Group does not have any material credit risk exposure to any single debtor or group of debtors under financial instruments entered into by the Group.

# Cost basis

The non-current assets of the CGU carrying value (including Property, Plant and Equipment) were assessed on a fair value less costs to sell basis. The Group assesses for indicators of impairment at the asset cash generating unit level, which is considered the smallest identifiable group of assets generating cash inflows that are largely independent of cash inflows from other assets. The Group determined this to be the orchard level.

An independent valuation was performed by Herron Todd White in September 2022 for specific assets of our Almond Division (ten owned orchards and the Carina West Processing Facility). The orchards were valued using a direct comparison summation and a discounted cashflow to determine their market value. This was performed on the basis of 'highest and best use' being the most probable use of a property which is physically possible, appropriately justified, legally permissible, financially feasible, and results in the highest value of the property being valued. The valuation approach used for the processing facility was capitalisation of Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) and a productive unit basis to determine its market value. The book value of the assets at 30 September 2023 was  $332.1 million against the September 2022 valuation performed by Herron Todd White amounting to$ 458.4 million which was confirmed against current market conditions to support the carrying values at 30 September 2023 by performing a sample of external valuations at this date. As the inputs to determine the fair value are unobservable, the valuation is considered Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

# Depreciation

The depreciable amount of all fixed assets including buildings, but excluding freehold land are depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives to the entity commencing from the time the asset is held ready for use. The useful economic life and residual value of PPE is reviewed on an annual basis considering key assumptions including forecast usage, changes in technology, physical condition, and potential climate change implications.

Bearer plants are assumed ready for use when a commercial crop is produced from the seventh year post planting. The depreciation on the almond trees amounting to  $12.42 million (2022:$ 10.20 million) was capitalised into the growing crop cost base. Leasehold improvements commence depreciation when a commercial crop is produced from the seventh year post planting and depreciated over the shorter of either the unexpired period of the lease or the estimated useful lives of the improvements.

The useful lives for each class of assets are:

Buildings 25 to 40 years

Plant and equipment 5 to 20 years

Bearer plants 10 to 30 years

Irrigation systems 10 to 40 years

Leasehold improvements 13 to 14 years

# Capital works in progress

Capital works in progress are valued at cost and relate to costs incurred for owned orchards and other assets under development.

# Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions

# Carrying value of non-current assets

The recoverable value assessment includes assumptions related to fair value including relevant transactional prices, market conditions and asset useful lives. The carrying value assessment of bearer plants includes judgement on tree age, yields and estimates for tree damage. Refer to Note 1.2.1 for assumptions made in relation to climate related risks.

* This relates to ROU assets when the lease has expired and ownership remains with the Company.

# (a) Orchard

The orchards comprise leases with Arrow Funds Management, Rural Funds Management, Lachlan Valley Farms and Aware Super. A total of 11,729 (2022: 11,729) acres of land are leased over an initial 20 year term (with extension options) in which the Company has the right to harvest almonds and citrus from the trees for the term of the agreement. The Company also has first right of refusal to purchase the properties in the event that the lessor wishes to sell.

# (b) Orchard depreciation

Depreciation relating to the orchards have either been capitalised as part of growing crop and leasehold improvements or expensed directly to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Depreciation relating to a small portion of land (sub-leased out by the Group) used for citrus farming has been expensed.

A Right-of-Use ('ROU') asset is recognised at the commencement date of a lease. The ROU asset is measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability, adjusted for, as applicable, by any lease payments made at or before the commencement date net of any lease incentives received, any initial direct costs incurred, and an estimate of costs expected to be incurred for dismantling and removing the underlying asset, and restoring the site or asset.

ROU assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the unexpired period of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset, whichever is shorter. Where the Group expects to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the depreciation is expensed over its estimated useful life. ROU assets are subject to impairment or adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities.

The ROU assets carrying values were assessed by comparing the net present value of future cashflows against the lease payments over the life of the leases to ensure recoverability.

The Group has elected not to recognise a ROU asset and corresponding lease liability for short-term leases with terms of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. Lease payments on these assets are expensed to the income statement as incurred.

# Assessment of recoverable value

The Group assesses for indicators of impairment at the asset cash generating unit level which is determined to be the orchard level. During the year, indicators of impairment were determined to be present at two leased orchards, as a result of lower than Group average profitability for the orchards. The ROU assets carrying values were assessed by comparing the net present value of future cashflows against the lease payments over the life of the leases to ensure recoverability.

# Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions

# Recoverable value of right of use assets

Where indicators of impairment are identified and a value in use model is prepared to support the carrying value of the right of use asset, there are estimates in future cash flows assumptions for yield by orchard, quality of almonds and almond price. The key estimate is the future almond price which is based on a 10 year historical average.

# Permanent water rights

Permanent water rights are recorded at historical cost. Such rights have an indefinite life and are not amortised. As an integral component of the land and irrigation infrastructure required to grow almonds, the carrying value is tested annually for impairment. If events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment, the carrying value is adjusted to take account of any impairment losses.

The value of permanent water rights relates to the Group's CGU and is an integral part of land and irrigation infrastructure required to grow almond orchards. The fair value of permanent water rights is supported by the tradeable market value, which at current market prices is in excess of book value.

The Group's portfolio of water rights is currently recorded at a historical cost value of  $58.8 million (2022:$ 58.8 million). A market value assessment was performed at the end of the financial year. This was completed by accessing the State Water Registers and determining the median price for the applicable class of water rights. This value is then applied on a like for like basis to the Group's water portfolio. As water prices fluctuate due to seasonal factors, current market rates have been valued internally at $119.5 million (2022: $128.6 million). As the inputs to determine the fair value are observable, the valuation is considered Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

# Software

Costs associated with maintaining software programmes are recognised as an expense when incurred. Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable software products controlled by the Group are recognised as intangible assets when the following criteria are met:

- it is technically feasible to complete the software so that it will be available for use  
management intends to complete the software to use it  
there is an ability to use the software  
- it can be demonstrated how the software will generate probable future economic benefits  
- adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development of the software  
- the expenditure attributable to the software during its development can be reliably measured

Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software include employee costs, consultant costs and an appropriate portion of relevant overheads. Capitalised development costs are recorded as intangible assets and amortised from the point at which the asset is ready for use.

Software costs are amortised on a straight line basis over the period of their expected benefit, being 7 years.

# License

These are costs incurred for the application of an EPA license as part of the manufacturing of the composts program which involves converting hull and waste into composts material that can be used as fertilisers. These costs are amortised on a straight line basis over a period of 10 years.

# Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group's share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary/business at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is not amortised. Instead, goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired and is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.

# Impairment of assets

Goodwill, brand names and permanent water rights that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.

The Group has determined it appropriate to operate as a single segment and operates one CGU, that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. The goodwill is allocated to the CGU at the level that is monitored for internal management purposes.

# (a) Impairment tests for goodwill

# Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions

During the financial year, following the reduction in the Group's 2023 operating profit due to the write-off of the 2022 crop inventory and estimated decrease in yield of the 2023 crop, the Group considered the event as an indicator of impairment, resulting in the completion of impairment testing as at 31 March 2023 on a Value In Use (VIU) basis. Impairment testing concluded that the recoverable amounts of the CGU's assets did not exceed the carrying value resulting in the write off on the Group's goodwill balance of $26 million. Key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations for impairment include a real pre-tax weighted average cost of capital (of 12.1%), long term growth rate (of 2.75%), harvest volumes, almond price, growing crop costs and water prices. Additionally, assumptions around capital expenditure and working capital changes were incorporated. The real pre-tax weighted average cost of capital takes into account industry related gearing levels, risk premiums and benchmarking peer group rates used. This rate differs to what the Group uses internally to assess strategic opportunities and asset performance.

At that time, the forecasted cashflows for the remainder of FY2023 were based on the latest assumptions of forecast weather patterns, a lower Californian 2023 crop related to drought impacting volume, quality and production cost and increasing almond prices globally. The post FY2023 cashflows were based on the Group's medium to long term averages relating to production yields, global almond pricing, production costs including water, given the difficulty in predicting weather patterns impacting SHV profitability.

A lease liability is recognised at the commencement date of a lease. The lease liability is initially recognised at the present value of the lease payments to be made over the term of the lease, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the consolidated entity's incremental borrowing rate. Lease payments comprise of fixed payments less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option when the exercise of the option is reasonably certain to occur, and any anticipated termination penalties. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.

Lease liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The carrying amounts are remeasured if there is a change in the following: future lease payments arising from a change in an index or a rate used; residual guarantee; lease term; certainty of a purchase option and termination penalties. When a lease liability is remeasured, an adjustment is made to the corresponding ROU asset, or to profit or loss if the carrying amount of the ROU asset is fully written down.

Leases are secured with the orchards, property and plant and equipment.

# 3.11 Deferred Tax (Non Current) (continued)

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences at the tax rates expected to apply when the assets are recovered or liabilities are settled, based on those tax rates which are enacted or substantively enacted. The relevant tax rates are applied to the cumulative amounts of deductible and taxable temporary differences to measure the deferred tax asset or liability. An exception is made for certain temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of an asset or a liability. No deferred tax asset or liability is recognised in relation to these temporary differences if they arose in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction did not affect either accounting profit or taxable profit or loss.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses.

Deferred tax liabilities and assets are not recognised for temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax bases of investments in controlled entities where the parent entity is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Current and deferred tax balances attributable to amounts recognised directly in equity are also recognised directly in equity.

# Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions

# Recoverability of deferred tax assets

Judgement is required to determine whether deferred tax assets are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Deferred tax assets, including those arising from unutilised tax losses, require management to assess the likelihood that the Group will generate sufficient taxable earnings in future periods in order to utilise recognised deferred tax assets.

Assumptions about the generation of future taxable income is based on forecast cash flows from operations, which are impacted by various factors including almond sales prices, crop volumes, climate change risks, etc. To the extent that the future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, the ability of the Group to realise the net deferred tax assets recorded at the reporting date could be impacted.

The Group has concluded that the deferred tax assets will be recoverable using the estimated future taxable income based on the approved FY2024 budget, and future business plans. The Group is expected to generate taxable income from 2024 onwards. The losses can be carried forward indefinitely and have no expiry date.

# Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount has been reliably estimated.

# Employee benefits

This covers the leave obligations for long service leave and annual leave which are classified as either short-term benefits or other long-term benefits explained below. The current portion of this liability includes all of the accrued annual leave, the unconditional entitlements to long service leave where employees have completed the required period of service and also for those employees who are entitled to pro-rata payments in certain circumstances. The entire amount of the provision is presented as current, since the group does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement for any of these obligations.

Contributions are made by the Company to employees' superannuation funds and are charged as expenses when incurred.

# (i) Short-term obligations

Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits and annual leave expected to be settled wholly within 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service are recognised in respect of employees' services up to the end of the reporting period and are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled.

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(CONTINUED)

# 3.12 Provisions (continued)

The liability for annual leave is recognised in the provision for employee benefits. All other short-term employee benefit obligations are presented as payables.

# (ii) Other long-term benefit obligations

The liability for long service leave and annual leave which is not expected to be settled wholly within 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service is recognised in the provision for employee benefits and measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the end of the reporting period using the projected unit credit method. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service. Expected future payments are discounted using market yields at the end of the reporting period on national government bonds with terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows.

# Performance Rights

# Long Term Incentive Plan

Select Harvests Limited ('the Company') offers employee participation in long term incentive schemes as part of the remuneration packages for the employees. In determining the quantum of rights offered the board considers a number of factors including: the corporate strategy; the appropriate mix of fixed and at risk remuneration; the fair value and face value of the rights; and the market relativity of employees with equivalent responsibilities.

The long-term scheme involves the issue of performance rights to the employee, under the Long Term Incentive Plan. The market value of ordinary Select Harvests Limited shares closed at  $4.01 on 30 September 2023 ($ 5.26 on 30 September 2022).

# Ordinary shares

Ordinary shares entitle the holder to participate in dividends and the proceeds on winding up of the Company in proportion to the number of and amounts paid on the shares held.

On a show of hands every holder of ordinary shares present at a meeting in person or by proxy, is entitled to one vote, and upon a poll each share is entitled to one vote.

# Capital risk management

The Group's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.

# Borrowings

Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption amount is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(CONTINUED)

# 4.3 Borrowings (continued)

the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates.

Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period.

# Borrowing costs

Borrowing costs incurred for the construction of any qualifying asset are capitalised during the period of time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use. All other borrowing costs, inclusive of all facility fees, bank charges, and interest, are expensed as incurred.

# (a) Interest rate risk exposures

Details of the Company's exposure to interest rate changes on borrowings are set out in Note 4.4.

# (b) Assets pledged as security

The bank overdraft and debt facilities of the parent entity and subsidiaries are secured by the following:

i. A registered mortgage debenture is held as security over all the assets and undertakings of Select Harvests Limited and the entities of the wholly owned group.  
ii. A deed of cross guarantee exists between the entities of the wholly owned group.

# Financing arrangements

During the financial year, the Group successfully secured credit approval for an increase in banking facilities, adjusted covenants as well as incorporating the seasonal facility into its overall banking facility. Incorporating the seasonal facility into the overall banking facility ensures certainty around access to the seasonal facility should the Group require it for the 2024 harvest. The new facility limit amounted to  $260 million (2022:$ 175.1 million) with the limit reducing by $20 million each at 1st July 2024 and 1st July 2025. Please refer to note 4.4 for further information.

The Group also adjusted it's covenants computation by decreasing the fixed charge cover ratio (FCC) covenant from  $>3.0$  applicable at the first testing date (as at 31 March 2024) to  $>2.0$  times. At the September 2024 testing date, the FCC ratio will revert back to  $>3.0$ . The two other covenants remained the same as per the previous agreement:

- Liquidity ratio requirement of >1.2  
Net gearing ratio requirement of  $< 40\%$

There was no change made to the Company's bank overdraft facilities which amounted to USD$5 million (2022: USD$5 million). The current interest rates at balance date are 5.81% (2022: 4.57%) on the debt facility, and 1.675% (2022: 1.675%) on the United States dollar bank overdraft facility.

# 4.4 Financial Risk Management

The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk, interest rate risk and commodity price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group uses different methods to measure different types of risk to which it is exposed. These methods include sensitivity analysis in the case of interest rate risk, foreign exchange and other price risks, and ageing analysis for credit risk.

Risk management is carried out by management pursuant to policies approved by the Board of Directors.

# (a) Market risk

# (i) Foreign exchange risk

Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the Company's functional currency.

The Group sells both almonds harvested from owned orchards through the almond pool and processed products internationally in United States dollars, and purchases raw materials and other inputs to the manufacturing and almond growing process from overseas suppliers predominantly in United States dollars. The Group also acquires capital related items internationally in both United States dollars and European Euros.

Management and the Board review the foreign exchange position of the Group and, where appropriate, enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments, transacted with the Group's bankers to manage its foreign exchange risk. These include formulating various strategies, FEC's, and options.

The exposure to foreign currency risk at the reporting date was as follows:

<table><tr><td>Group</td><td>2023 USD $&#x27;000</td><td>2022 USD $&#x27;000</td></tr><tr><td>Trade receivables net of payables</td><td>15,187</td><td>16,895</td></tr><tr><td>Overdraft</td><td>(4,083)</td><td>(1,732)</td></tr><tr><td>Foreign Exchange Contracts (FEC&#x27;s)</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>• sell foreign currency (cash flow hedges)</td><td>96,693</td><td>122,187</td></tr><tr><td>Sell foreign currency option contracts*</td><td>10,000</td><td>-</td></tr></table>

* Foreign currency option contracts have a number of possible outcomes depending on the spot rate at maturity. These contracts are shown at face value. Depending on spot rate at maturity, the value of the contract can be USD10 million (2022: Nil) or USD20 million (2022: Nil).

# Group sensitivity analysis

Based on financial instruments held at 30 September 2023, had the Australian dollar strengthened/ weakened by  $5\%$  against the US dollar, with all other variables held constant, the Group's results for the period would have been  $\$ 5.51$  million lower/ $6.09$  million higher (2022:  $\$ 6.26$  million lower/ $6.92$  million higher), mainly as a result of the US dollar denominated financial instruments as detailed in the above table. Equity would have been  $\$ 6.09$  million lower/ $6.73$  million higher (2022:  $\$ 7.04$  million lower/ $7.78$  million higher), arising mainly from FEC's designated as cash flow hedges.

# (ii) Cash flow interest rate risk

The Group's interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at variable rates, which exposes the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. The Group's borrowings at variable interest rate are denominated in AUD.

At the reporting date the Group had the following variable rate borrowings:

<table><tr><td></td><td>2023 Interest rate %</td><td>2023 Balance $’000</td><td>2022 Interest rate %</td><td>2022 Balance $’000</td></tr><tr><td>Debt facilities (AUD)</td><td>5.28%</td><td>185,000</td><td>4.02%</td><td>133,000</td></tr><tr><td>Overdraft (USD)</td><td>1.68%</td><td>6,322</td><td>1.68%</td><td>2,663</td></tr></table>

An analysis of debt maturities is provided in (c) below.

The Group analyses interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis in conjunction with the debt facility, cash flow and capital management. With the current low interest rate environment and the future expectation that interest rates will remain at low levels, management has not entered into any interest rate swap agreement during the year.

# Group sensitivity

At 30 September 2023, if interest rates had changed by  $+/-$  25 basis points from the weighted average interest rate with all other variables held constant, the result for the period would have been  $331,000 lower/higher (2022:$ 236,000 lower/higher).

# Financial Assets

Collectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis. Trade receivables are carried at full amounts due less expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables.

Amounts receivable from other debtors are carried at full amounts due. Other debtors are normally settled on 30 days from month end unless there is a specific contract which specifies an alternative date. Amounts receivable from related parties are carried at full amounts due.

# Financial Liabilities

The bank overdraft disclosed within interest bearing liabilities is carried at the principal amount and is part of the Net Cash balance in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Interest is charged as an expense as it accrues. Liabilities are recognised for amounts to be paid in the future for goods and services received, whether or not billed to the Company.

# (b) Credit risk

Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, favourable derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to wholesale, retail and farm investor customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.

The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk. The Group has policies in place to ensure that sales of products and services are made to customers with an appropriate credit history. Derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high credit quality financial institutions.

The credit quality of financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired can be assessed by reference to external credit ratings (if available) and to historical information. The majority of the Group's sales are derived from large, established customers with no history of default.

The maximum exposure to credit risk, excluding the value of any collateral or other security, at balance date to recognised financial assets is the carrying amount of those assets, net of any provisions for doubtful debts of those assets, as disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and Notes to the financial statements.

The Group applies the AASB 9 Financial Instruments simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over a period of 24 month and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle the receivables.

The Group's banking partners have long-term credit ratings of AA- and A+ (Standard and Poor's).

# (d) Fair Value Measurement

The fair value of certain financial assets and financial liabilities must be estimated for recognition and measurement or for disclosure purposes.

The fair value of financial instruments, such as FEC's and foreign currency options, are valued using specific valuation techniques as follows:

- for FEC's - the present value of future cash flows based on the forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date  
- for foreign currency options - option pricing models

The nominal value less estimated credit adjustments of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values. The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Company for similar instruments.

Disclosures are required of fair value measurements by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy:

a. Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level one);  
b. Inputs other than quoted prices included within level one that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices) (Level two); and  
c. Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) (Level three).

At 30 September 2023 the Group's assets and liabilities measured and recognised at fair value comprised the FEC's and foreign currency options. These are level 2 measurements under the hierarchy.

# (b) Tax consolidation legislation

Select Harvests Limited and its wholly-owned Australian controlled entities have implemented the tax consolidation legislation as of 1 July 2003. The head entity, Select Harvests Limited, and the controlled entities in the tax consolidated group account for their own current and deferred tax amounts. These tax amounts are measured as if each entity in the tax consolidated group continues to be a standalone taxpayer in its own right. In addition to its own current and deferred tax amounts, Select Harvests Limited also recognises the current tax liabilities (or assets) and the deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses and unused tax credits assumed from controlled entities in the tax consolidated group.

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(CONTINUED)

# 5.2 Parent Entity Financial Information (continued)

The entities have also entered into a tax funding agreement under which the wholly-owned entities fully compensate Select Harvests Limited for any current tax payable assumed and are compensated by Select Harvests Limited for any current tax receivable and deferred tax assets relating to unused tax losses or unused tax credits that are transferred to Select Harvests Limited under the tax consolidation legislation. The funding amounts are determined by reference to the amounts recognised in the wholly-owned entities' financial statements.

The amounts receivable/payable under the tax funding agreement is due upon receipt of the funding advice from the head entity, which is issued as soon as practicable after the end of each financial year

The head entity may also require payment of interim funding amounts to assist with its obligations to pay tax instalments. The funding amounts are recognised as current intercompany receivables or payables.

Assets or liabilities arising under tax funding agreements with the tax consolidated entities are recognised as current amounts receivable from or payable to other entities in the Group.

Any difference between the amounts assumed and amounts receivable or payable under the tax funding agreement are recognised as a contribution to (or distribution from) wholly-owned tax consolidated entities.

# (c) Guarantees entered into by parent entity

Each entity within the Group has entered into a cross deed of financial guarantee under which each company guarantees the debts of the others. By entering into the deed, the wholly-owned entities have been relieved from the requirement to prepare a financial report and directors' report under ASIC Corporations (Wholly-owned Companies) Instrument 2016/785.

Loans are made by Select Harvests Limited to controlled entities under normal terms and conditions.

# Long Term Incentive Plan

The Group offers executive directors and senior executives the opportunity to participate in the long term incentive plan (LTI Plan) involving the issue of performance rights to the employee under the LTI Plan. The LTI Plan provides for the offer of a parcel of performance rights with a three year performance period to participating employees on an annual basis.

Previous performance rights issue had rights vesting each year, with half of the rights vesting upon achievement of underlying earnings per share (EPS) and the other half vesting upon achievement of total shareholder return (TSR) targets. The underlying EPS growth targets are based on the Cumulative Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of the Company's underlying EPS over the three years prior to vesting. The TSR targets are measured based on the Company's average TSR compared to the TSR of a peer group of ASX listed companies over the three years prior to vesting. The performance targets and vesting proportions are as follows:

<table><tr><td>Measure</td><td>Rights to Vest</td></tr><tr><td>Underlying EPS</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Below 5% CAGR</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>5% CAGR</td><td>25%</td></tr><tr><td>5.1% - 19.9% CAGR</td><td>Pro rata vesting</td></tr><tr><td>20% or higher CAGR</td><td>50%</td></tr><tr><td>TSR</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Below the 50th percentile*</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>50th percentile*</td><td>25%</td></tr><tr><td>51st - 74th percentile*</td><td>Pro rata vesting</td></tr><tr><td>At or above 75th percentile*</td><td>50%</td></tr></table>

# Fair value of performance rights granted

The assessed fair value at grant date is determined using the Black-Scholes-Merton model (ROCE valuation) and the Monte Carlo option pricing model (Absolute TSR) that takes into account the term of the rights, the impact of dilution, the share price at offer date and expected price volatility of the underlying share, the expected dividend yield and the risk free interest rate for the term of the right. This assessment was made by an external expert.

The model inputs for rights granted in the tables above included:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Share price atgrant date</td><td>Expectedvolatility*</td><td>Expecteddividends</td><td>Risk freeinterest rate</td></tr><tr><td>07 April 2023 Performance Rights Issue</td><td>$4.28</td><td>36%</td><td>1.00%</td><td>2.88%</td></tr><tr><td>09 May 2023 Performance Rights Issue</td><td>$4.02</td><td>36%</td><td>1.00%</td><td>3.43%</td></tr><tr><td>31 May 2022 Performance Rights Issue</td><td>$5.88</td><td>39%</td><td>2.51%</td><td>2.65%</td></tr><tr><td>28 July 2021 Performance Rights Issue</td><td>$7.66</td><td>40%</td><td>0.52%</td><td>0.02%</td></tr><tr><td>27 March 2020 Performance Rights Issue</td><td>$7.05</td><td>40%</td><td>4.95%</td><td>0.35%</td></tr><tr><td>29 April 2019 Performance Rights Issue</td><td>$6.49</td><td>40%</td><td>1.83%</td><td>1.33%</td></tr></table>

* Expected share price volatility was calculated with reference to the annualised standard deviation of daily share price returns on the underlying security over a specified period.

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(CONTINUED)

# 6.3 Share Based Payments (continued)

# Share-based payments

Share-based compensation benefits are provided to employees via the Select Harvests Limited Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP).

The fair value of performance rights granted under the Select Harvests Limited LTIP is recognised as an employee benefit expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and recognised over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the performance rights. The fair value at grant date is independently determined using a Monte Carlo option pricing model that takes into account the term of the right, the vesting and performance criteria, the impact of dilution, the share price at grant date and expected price volatility of the underlying share, the expected dividend yield and the risk free interest rate for the term of the right. The fair value of the performance rights granted is adjusted to reflect market vesting conditions, but excludes the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth targets). Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of rights that are expected to vest. At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimate of the number of rights that are expected to vest. The employee benefit expense recognised each period takes into account the most recent estimate. The impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income with a corresponding adjustment to equity.

# Our audit approach

An audit is designed to provide reasonable assurance about whether the financial report is free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial report.

We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial report as a whole, taking into account the geographic and management structure of the Group, its accounting processes and controls and the industry in which it operates.

Our audit focused on where the Group made subjective judgements; for example, significant accounting estimates involving assumptions and inherently uncertain future events.

# Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial report for the current period. The key audit matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Further, any commentary on the outcomes of a particular audit procedure is made in that context. We communicated the key audit matters to the Audit and Risk Committee.

# Key audit matter

# How our audit addressed the key audit matter

# Basis of preparation

(Refer to note 1.2.2)

As described in note 1.2.2, the Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared by the Group on a going concern basis.

The Group's profitability and cash flows have been impacted by a downgrade in quality of the 2022 crop, lower almond pricing, high operating costs and poor bloom and growing conditions impacting the net volume of the 2023 crop.

The Group prepared a cash flow forecast for the next 12 months from the date the financial report is issued, which assessed its liquidity and compliance with forecast covenant positions.

Our procedures included the following, amongst others:

- Evaluated the appropriateness of the Group's assessment of their ability to continue as a going concern, including whether the level of analysis is appropriate given the nature of the Group and the period covered is at least 12 months from the date of our auditor's report.  
- Read the relevant banking facility agreements and developed an understanding of the key terms, including available drawdown amounts, maturity dates and covenants.  
- Obtained the Group's cash flow forecast and compared the future cash flows used in the forecast with the forecasts formally approved by the Board.  
Assessed whether the significant assumptions for harvest volumes, almond price and operating costs used in the cash flow forecast and covenant calculation were appropriate, with reference to the historical performance and external market data where possible.

# Key audit matter

# How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Assessing the appropriateness of the Group's basis of preparation for the financial report was considered a key audit matter due to its importance to the overall Consolidated Financial Statements and the level of judgement involved in forecasting future cash flows for a period of at least 12 months from the audit report date and covenant calculations of the Group.

- Checked the mathematical accuracy of key data inputs for the cash flow forecast.  
- Checked the mathematical accuracy of the covenant calculations and compared the calculations to the relevant covenant requirements in the banking facility agreements.  
- Evaluated the reasonableness of the disclosures made in note 1.2.2, including significant assumptions and sensitivities to changes in such assumptions, against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.

# Inventory valuation

# (Refer to note 3.2)

The Group held inventory of \(85.3 million at 30 September 2023. The inventory balance includes harvested almonds at year end. In accordance with Australian Accounting Standards, inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

We considered inventory valuation to be a key audit matter because of the financial significance of the inventory balance and the judgement required by the Group in determining key assumptions used in determining net realisable value.

Our procedures included the following, amongst others:

Assessed the Group's accounting policies against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.  
Evaluated net realisable value of inventory by:

- comparing the carrying value of inventory at year-end, to actual selling prices achieved after year-end for a sample of items sold or to a sample of committed sales contracts, and  
- assessing whether the almond price assumptions used to determine the net realisable value of the inventory, where there were no committed sales contracts, were appropriate, with reference to market prices.

- Evaluated the reasonableness of the disclosures made in note 3.2 in light of the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-10-20/91a50790-81b7-4c09-95f6-6c3cada9de83/b33265b02ee205967302edbcb0e66dcbaf7ede86c73b8935072da57ce5587911.jpg)

# Key audit matter

# How our audit addressed the key audit matter

# Carrying value of Goodwill

(Refer to note 3.7)

During the year, the Group held goodwill of $26.0 million.

The Group identified one Cash Generating Unit (CGU) for assessing the carrying value of goodwill. At 31 March 2023, the Group performed an impairment assessment for the CGU, by preparing a financial model to determine if the carrying value of the assets is supported by forecast future cash flows, discounted to present value (the "model"). The impairment assessment resulted in a full impairment of the goodwill balance.

We consider the carrying value of goodwill to be a key audit matter because of the financial significance of the carrying value of the CGU and the significant judgements and assumptions applied by the Group in estimating forecast future cash flows.

Our procedures included the following, amongst others:

Assessed whether the Group's determination of the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) was consistent with our knowledge of the Group's operations.  
- Tested the mathematical accuracy of key data in the model.  
- Compared the forecast cash flows used in the model with the forecasts formally approved by the Board.  
Assessed whether the significant assumptions used in the model, including forecast harvest volumes, water prices and almond pricing, were appropriate with reference to external market data, where available.  
Assessed whether the discount rate and long-term growth rate applied in the model were appropriate, based on market information.  
- Evaluated the reasonableness of the disclosures made in note 3.7, including key assumptions, in light of the requirements of the Australian Accounting Standards.

# Other information

The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report for the year ended 30 September 2023, but does not include the financial report and our auditor's report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and accordingly we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon through our opinion on the financial report. We have issued a separate opinion on the remuneration report.

In connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of the directors for the financial report

The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

# Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial report

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial report.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial report is located at the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board website at: https://www.auasb.gov.au/admin/file/content102/c3/ar1_2020.pdf. This description forms part of our auditor's report.
