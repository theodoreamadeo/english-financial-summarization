# The Group has achieved a year-on-year improvement in reported results, despite having to navigate a challenging trading environment. Our business has demonstrated strong resilience as we adapted to consumers' increased price sensitivity.

# Dear Shareholders,

The Group has achieved a year-on-year improvement in reported results, despite having to navigate a challenging trading environment. Whilst global efforts to reduce inflation are finally showing success, consumers across all regions continue to endure lower purchasing power in a higher cost-of-living environment. Our business has demonstrated strong resilience as we adapted to consumers' increased price sensitivity.

We achieved revenue growth in FY2024,  $1 \%$ higher from FY2023. Along with cost management, the Group’s profit before tax after exceptional items improved by  $9 \%$ to  $44.6$ million. Consequently, the Group’s profit attributable to the owners of the Parent rose by  $26 \%$ to  $\$ 34.7$ million.

We ended FY2024 with a strong financial position, holding a net cash balance of $177 million. Our conservative capital management ensures we are positioned well to resist future global uncertainties and downside risks.

We remain committed to distributing sustainable dividends to our shareholders. For FY2024, the Board has recommended a final dividend of  $0.04 per share. If approved by our shareholders at the upcoming Annual General Meeting, the total dividends for FY2024 would amount to$ 0.05 per share.

To ensure that the Company maintains an appropriate mix of skills and experience in this constantly changing global landscape, a review of the composition of the Board and its Committees is currently being undertaken. The Company expects to complete this process by mid-2025 and will announce any updates at its conclusion.

On behalf of the Board, I express our deepest gratitude for the continuous trust and support of our shareholders, customers, and business partners. I also extend my heartfelt appreciation to our staff for their dedicated contributions and continuing efforts in this changing business environment.

We look forward to another year of growth and support together.

We build on our Chairman's statement to present our Financial Results for FY2024.

In 2024, global inflation rates have stabilised, with many regions experiencing periods of disinflation. Consequently, global economic growth has moderated. Despite the lower inflation, the higher cost-of-living environment has persisted, influencing consumers' purchasing power and confidence across the Group's operating regions. We have also noted the changing preferences of our consumers, shifting towards lower-value and smaller-sized products.

The Group has adapted, with strategic price and product mix adjustments applied to maintain our competitive position. Opportunities, including new products and expanded regions, were also pursued to unlock new growth potentials. The Group achieved a revenue of \(636 million in FY2024, a growth of \(1\%\) from FY2023. When foreign exchange effects are removed, the year-on-year improvement was \(2\%\) in constant currency terms.

Cost of materials fell by  $1 \%$ and utilities by  $2 \%$ during FY2024. However, labour and distribution costs rose by  $1 \%$ and  $14 \%$ respectively. In addition, the Group rationalised its marketing efforts, leading to a  $9 \%$ reduction in marketing expense in FY2024 from the year before.

Our reported results continue to be affected by non-trading items. In respect of the December 2021 flood damage at one of our factories in Malaysia, we have finalised all insurance claims and received the final payments during the year. In total, we recorded exceptional gains relating mainly to insurance of  $6.4 million in FY2024, lower than the$ 13.8 million recognised in FY2023.

Additionally, we recorded higher foreign currency translation losses amounting to  $8.8 million in FY2024, compared to$ 2.4 million in FY2023, arising mainly from the AUD-dominated cash deposits. A $1.9 million impairment was also recognised in FY2024 to write down some assets no longer in use to their expected realisable value.

In accordance with accounting standards, we periodically assessed the recoverable amount of our investment in the joint venture, Gardenia Bakeries (KL) Sdn Bhd, and have recorded a lower non-cash impairment of  $1.2 million in FY2024, compared to the non-cash impairment of$ 9.5 million in FY2023.

As a result, the Group's EBITDA before exceptional items improved by  $24\%$  to  $59.6 million for FY2024. Profit before tax after exceptional items also improved by \(9\%$  to \)44.6 million.

# JOINT GROUP MANAGING DIRECTORS' REPORT

Consolidating 100% of GBKL but excluding head office, total proforma revenue of $970 million was achieved in FY2024, 1% higher than FY2023. Proforma EBITDA before exceptional items (including GBKL's royalty income to QAF Limited) rose by 11% to $103 million in FY2024. Please see the charts below.

The Group remains in a strong financial position with a net cash position of  $177 million, as at 31 December 2024. In consideration of our financial performance and commitment to sustainable dividend distributions, the Board has recommended a final dividend of$ 0.04 per share for FY2024. If approved by our shareholders at the upcoming Annual General Meeting, the total dividends for FY2024 would amount to $0.05 per share.

Moreover, our strong balance sheet continues to position us well to weather unexpected financial stresses ahead. The year ahead poses possible challenges as geopolitical uncertainties have not abated, with a new focus on the likelihood of higher and additional tariffs being imposed by some countries. While the downside risks remain, economic growth across our operating regions is expected to be modest.

We remain committed to investing in our proprietary brands to pursue long-term growth. We will continue to strategically adjust our product mix and develop new products to expand our product range and meet the changing preferences of our consumers. We will also continuously look to expand our presence through the expansion of our distribution channels and exploration of new opportunities.

As we look forward to another year ahead, we recognise and appreciate the contributions of our colleagues and the support of the Board during the past year. We also express our thanks to our shareholders, customers, and business partners.

"Gardenia Singapore"

# OPERATIONAL REVIEW

# BAKERY

In 2024, Gardenia Singapore maintained its leadership position in the industry with steady demand for its core products and strategic expansion into new products.

The local industry has been impacted by reduced domestic consumer spending due to factors such as heightened cost of living and increased cross-border travel. Gardenia Singapore remained resilient and stayed responsive to consumer preferences for delicious, innovative bread options and convenient on-the-go bun products. In addition, strategic partnerships with island-wide retail chains, digital sales channels and a robust distribution network ensured that Gardenia Singapore's products remained widely accessible.

On top of staying adaptable to the preferences of its consumers, Gardenia Singapore is committed to enhancing the nutritional value and quality of its products through ongoing product innovation. This has resulted in the introduction of new products during 2024, including:

- Gardenia Nutri-Ace Hearty Oat Wholemeal Loaf - A heart-friendly wholemeal loaf for health-conscious consumers aiming to "ACE" their daily nutrition.  
- Gardenia Pandan Coconut with Gula Melaka Loaf - A speciality fruit loaf with local flavours tailored to the taste preference of Singaporeans.  
- Gardenia Gold Edition Cream Rolls – A newly-launched cream roll series with 4 flavours (Black Forest, Chocolate Hazelnut, Salted Caramel and Pandan Gula Melaka) enhancing its on-the-go product range that provides a convenient food option to busy consumers.  
- Gardenia Twiggies Peanut Butter Bounce - A new addition to the popular Twiggies range designed for younger consumers who seek a convenient and delicious treat.

Beyond delivering nutritious products, Gardenia Singapore has actively maintained collaboration with strategic partners to promote healthier, more active lifestyles while strengthening community ties.

- Gardenia Singapore has been a long-term supporter of nationwide initiatives by Singapore's Health Promotion Board ("HPB") since 1992. To help consumers identify healthier options, all of Gardenia Singapore's wholemeal and multi-grain products prominently feature HPB's "Healthier Choice" symbol.  
- Gardenia Singapore also maintained its support in HPB's annual "Eat Drink Shop Healthy 2024" campaign, aimed at encouraging healthier eating habits among consumers. This included its participation in community roadshows, sponsorship of products and investments in advertisement and promotion to amplify the campaign outreach.  
- Gardenia Singapore is also a long-term partner with Diabetes Singapore, actively supporting key events such as "World Diabetes Day", "World Obesity Day", "International Women's Day", "World Heart Day", and multiple health screening sessions. These initiatives aimed to raise awareness about diabetes prevention and management through healthier living practices.  
- To encourage the adoption of low glycemic index ("GI") foods, Gardenia Singapore organised promotions for its Low GI Nutri Multi-Grain and Low GI Soft Grain loaves, as well as a series of social media campaigns to emphasise the benefits of low GI food choices in reducing the risk of diabetes over time. Gardenia Singapore also took the opportunity to highlight the importance of wholegrains by engaging busy office workers in the Central Business District on "World Bread Day".  
- Gardenia Singapore actively supported a wide range of philanthropic community initiatives by partnering with organisations such as It's Raining Raincoats, Food From The Heart, Children's Society of Singapore and Project Sama Sama @ North West. Through the sponsorships and donations of bread, beneficiaries of such initiatives included the less fortunate households, healthcare organizations, social service agencies, community centres, public service workers and migrant workers, reflecting Gardenia Singapore's dedication to diverse groups across Singapore.

Gardenia Singapore consistently explores and enhances its operational efficiency to achieve better economies of scale, streamline production processes, and reinforce its commitment to excellence. During 2024, further initiatives were implemented, including the utilisation of capacity across the Gardenia bakery network, the installation of equipment to improve workers' safety, enhancing machine efficiency to streamline operations and reduce production time at our Singapore premises.

Gardenia Singapore's continuous efforts ensure that its products are produced in a clean and secure environment. For the  $30^{\text{th}}$  consecutive year, Gardenia Singapore has maintained Grade A status under the Food Safety Excellence Scheme, overseen by the Singapore Food Agency.

Gardenia Singapore has also received various awards and accolades, solidifying its position in the packaged bread industry, including:

- No. 1 Best Selling Bread Brand in Singapore in terms of value and volume sales for 2024. Gardenia Singapore also secured the No. 1 position from NielsenIQ in four key categories, namely, "White Bread", "Wholemeal Bread", "Flavoured Bread", and "Non-filled Bun Bread" for the period January to December 2024.  
- "Top Business Partner of the Year Award" by FairPrice for Gardenia Singapore's achievement of holistic growth, outstanding sales and providing strong partnership support during the year.  
- "Customer Favourite Brand Award" by DFI Retail Group and the "Favourite Brand Award" under the Bakery category by 7-Eleven in 2024. These accolades underscore Gardenia Singapore's dedication to delivering top-quality, value-for-money products that consistently exceed customer expectations.

Looking forward to 2025, business conditions are expected to remain challenging due to escalating geopolitical and trade tensions. Increased cross-border travel will likely sustain and impact domestic spending. The bakery landscape in Singapore will also continue to evolve and remain competitive, with rising demand for innovative flavours, and convenient and value-for-money products.

Gardenia Singapore is committed to fostering product innovations that excite consumers and optimise consumer campaigns and operational programs that deliver value. Gardenia Singapore will continue to drive initiatives that will focus on sustaining its leadership, such as:

- Expanding of ready-to-eat, single-serve buns that promote convenience for time-pressed consumers and its specialty product range.  
- Adopting strategic adjustments to its product and price mix, ensuring affordability for the mass market while maintaining quality and mitigating rising costs.  
- Increasing retail campaigns to meet the needs of cost-conscious consumers and deliver cost savings.

These actions will support and reinforce Gardenia Singapore's position as a trusted household brand while ensuring that its product portfolio aligns with consumer preferences and government initiatives for better public health.

Gardenia Malaysia continued to leverage on its strong foundations, driving consumption through the promotion of existing products and introduction of new products, to achieve gross sales of more than RM1.4 billion in 2024.

Gardenia Malaysia remains committed to being the market leader, despite the challenges in an increasingly competitive market. Industry growth was driven by ready-to-eat products, a trend Gardenia Malaysia was able to capitalise on. Gardenia Malaysia also increased its penetration of the instant noodle segment with Gardenia NuMee through effective marketing and communication strategies.

The introduction of new products during 2024 included:

- NuMee Instant Noodle Signature Laksa Kari – A premium instant noodle product which embodies the essence of traditional Laksa Kari with a modern twist.

- TOAST'EM Choco Perfecto – The chocolate loaf, laden with chocolate chips, was created to meet the preferences of a portion of consumers that prefer chocolate loaves without raisins.

Additionally, Gardenia Malaysia increased its efforts to connect and engage with its consumers directly through exciting on-ground activities, such as:

- QuickBites: "Minda Sihan, Cergas Fizikal" - Endorsed by the Ministry of Education Malaysia, Gardenia Malaysia held a mural contest featuring Gardenia QuickBites in schools. The contest sought to provide a platform for creativity and talent, while focusing on promoting a healthy mental and physical lifestyle. It made history by earning recognition as the "Most Wall Murals in A Branding Campaign" by The Malaysia Book of Records.  
- "NuMee MyMee" – Building on the success of the "NuMee Setulus Kasih Truck" in 2023, Gardenia Malaysia continued to expand awareness to government servants by reaching out to police and fire stations nationwide. The NuMee Setulus Kasih Wagon also travelled to various academic venues over 80 days to promote NuMee products among younger audiences.  
- NuMee's Brand Ambassador: Fasha Sandha - Social media campaigns and appearances at in-store cooking contests drove the promotion of Numee strongly. In addition, her popularity had boosted Gardenia's online presence through her established following.

- Regular monthly donations of food products to support Muhibbah Food Bank addressing food insecurity in the community and those affected by adverse events such as floods.

In 2024, Gardenia Malaysia is honoured to have received several accolades again, demonstrating the success of its actions during the year.

- Putra Brand Awards: "Platinum Award" - For the  $15^{\text{th}}$  consecutive year, Gardenia has been proudly recognised as Malaysia's preferred choice.

# AUSTRALIA

Bakers Maison Australia Pty Ltd ("Bakers Maison")

# OPERATIONAL REVIEW

# BAKERY

Building on the momentum of previous years, Bakers Maison continued to grow strongly during 2024. Whilst Bakers Maison had started the year strong, it was impacted in the second half by a slowdown in the Australian economy and the softening of the foodservice channel. In addition, despite inflation easing, higher-for-longer interest rates have impacted consumers' disposable income and confidence.

This year, Bakers Maison's growth was fuelled by the foodservice, quick service restaurants ("QSR") and travel and tourism segments. Additionally, Bakers Maison has begun exporting to New Zealand, unlocking new growth opportunities. Underlying these is Bakers Maison's commitment to meeting its consumers' needs and preferences, which has resulted in the introduction and enhancement of several products in 2024.

- Two new packaged, retail-ready products (Crusty French Stick and Banh Mi Rolls) were launched in May 2024 and have been performing very well in independent retailers.  
- A new Multi-Grain loaf version, an extension of its popular Continental Range, was released in September 2024. This loaf offers a healthy alternative in the lunch and sandwich segment.  
- A new Garlic Baguette was released in the fourth quarter of 2024. This new product has had great customer feedback and is showing good potential.  
- In March 2024, a Sour Dough culture tank was installed and commissioned. From a crafted mix of starter, the leaven is then added to the dough allowing Bakers Maison to create its own unique Sour Dough flavour.

Bakers Maison continues to improve its operations and manage costs as it faces strong cost pressures in areas such as labour and distribution. Several equipment have been commissioned that will improve efficiency and cost, while bringing flexibility in manufacturing. In addition, a full third-party audit of Baker Maison's manufacturing processes has delivered key improvement points that have been progressively implemented.

# OPERATIONAL REVIEW

# BAKERY

In 2024, Bakers Maison celebrated its  $25^{\text{th}}$  anniversary with a refreshed Bakers Maison logo. As Bakers Maison builds on its successes, participation in trade shows and strategic partnerships continue to play a crucial role in growing its presence, such as:

- Participation in various industry events such as "Foodservice Australia Trade Show 2024", "Metcash Food Expo and Convenience & Impulse Expo 2024" to expand its business presence and capture new opportunities.  
- Partnership with key distributor groups in their marketing programs which has strengthened business relationships and nurtured future opportunities.  
Collaboration with Chef Dave Wilson in Melbourne which increased Bakers Maison's visibility.  
- Investment in digital marketing to expand social media presence.

Moving into 2025, the Australian economy is expected to improve but with only modest growth. The industry will still be pressured by low consumer confidence as well as labour, transport and logistics cost pressures. The foodservice channel is expected to remain quite tight, with strong pressure on pricing and service levels. However, tourism is expected to continue to grow, with opportunities to capitalise on the airline and hotel channels.

Bakers Maison will continue to build up its resources to capture new opportunities and pursue growth.

- Bakers Maison will be introducing the tortilla and flat bread in 2025. This product will reinforce Bakers Maison's strong position in foodservice lunch segment.  
- Bakers Maison embarked on an expansion project that involved the installation of additional equipment to support growth as well as maximizing production floor space. This project was substantially completed in December 2024. Once running at full operations, these additions will allow the increase of production output and reduce overtime work.  
- An innovation department has been established, focusing on product development recipe improvements and ingredient research. This will provide Bakers Maison further opportunities to improve its current products, expand its product range and enter new product categories.

# THE PHILIPPINES

Gardenia Bakeries Philippines, Inc. Nutribaked Food Products, Inc. Nutrimax Fresh-Baked, Inc. Vitabread Food Products, Inc. Phil Foods Properties Inc. Philfoods Fresh-Baked Products Inc. Gardenia (Philippines) Trading and Distribution Corp. ("Gardenia Philippines")

In 2024, Gardenia Philippines maintained market leadership as it continuously focused on expanding its reach, increasing consumer engagement and expanding its product range to meet consumer preferences and drive consumption.

While economic growth in the Philippines continued to be resilient, inflationary pressures had impacted the fast-moving consumer goods ("FMCG") sector. As such, consumers reallocated their resources towards rice, causing a general decline in demand in the bread market.

Gardenia Philippines leveraged on the existing strength of its products to expand its accessibility and acceptance among consumers through key strategic decisions during 2024, by:

- Establishing more regional distributors and wholesalers to broaden coverage, and increasing trucking providers in Mindanao to improve reach.  
- Expanding to more provinces such as Zamboanga, Olutanga (Zamboanga Sibugay) and Siquijor.  
- Adding new supermarket and convenience store branches to its service network.  
- Increasing availability of Bakers Maison frozen products in supermarkets.

This was complemented by major marketing initiatives that supported Gardenia Philippines in driving consumption among its consumers.

- Extensive digital campaigns and product sampling activities to enhance brand visibility, promote its products and drive awareness of newer products such as Happy Mie and Coffee Smile. These efforts were synergised on-ground, and by public relations and influencer efforts to engage a wider target audience.  
- "Kusina ni Gardee (Gardee's Kitchen)" campaign that included both digital campaigns through recipe videos and live cooking demonstrations in supermarkets and schools to highlight the versatility of Gardenia products.  
- "MaSigLakas (Energy & Strength)" campaign for Gardenia Classic White Bread, promoting the Nutri+Plus Advantage and "Deliciously Nutritious" campaign for Gardenia High Fiber Wheat Raisin Loaf.

# OPERATIONAL REVIEW

# BAKERY, DISTRIBUTION AND WAREHOUSING

Beyond its existing range of products, Gardenia Philippines remained committed to meeting the evolving preferences of consumers and introduced new products in 2024.

- HealthiGrain Multigrain Loaf was introduced in March 2024. A premium, health-focused artisan-style sourdough bread that also combines the benefits of wholesome 10 grains, made more accessible to the mid-to-high-end market segment.  
- NeuBake White Bread Econo Pack and NeuBake Wheaten Bread Econo Pack were introduced in September 2024. These white and wheat-based breads targeting the lower-income segment were offered in smaller and more affordable packs.

To ensure quality products for its consumers, Gardenia Philippines consistently maintains its certifications across all its factories, continually enhancing its manufacturing facilities.

- Certifications such as ISO 9001:2015 and HACCP certification.  
- Halal registration, confirming the quality standards required to produce Halal-quality products.

Gardenia Philippines is also advancing its commitment to sustainability and people and skills development, with initiatives, such as:

Solar panel system at the factories in Luzon became fully operational in 2024, and new solar installation is underway at the Cagayan de Oro plant, with operations expected to commence in 2025.  
- Standardised quality control through knowledge-sharing and continuous training across Research and Development, Engineering, Food Safety, and Production teams.  
- Sustainability efforts such as a plastic packaging waste recovery program with local government offices, schools and local communities leading to recycling into school chairs donated to public schools.

# BAKERY, DISTRIBUTION AND WAREHOUSING

For Gardenia Philippines, supporting the community remains integral as it participated in numerous charitable and philanthropic efforts over the year. Notable initiatives include:

- Donation of Gardenia products to communities, charitable organisations and public elementary students.  
- Distribution of products to families affected by typhoons, fires, and floods through its Quick Response program.  
- Participation in the Department of Trade and Industry-led initiative, "Diskwento Caravan", offering basic goods at discounted prices to communities in various provinces.  
Educational initiatives such as Gardenia plant tours for students and individuals, the partnership with the Philippine Red Cross through the "Nutrisyon at Kalinisan Para sa Maayos na Kinabukasan (Nutrition and Hygiene for a Healthier Future)" program, and the wellness activities implemented by Gardenia's team of nutritionist-dietitians engaging students in healthy eating and hygiene practices.  
- Participation in coastal clean-up and environmental campaigns, resulting in Gardenia Philippines receiving recognition from the Laguna Lake Development Authority for their contributions.

As a result of its dedicated sustainability efforts during 2024, Gardenia Philippines is honoured to have been recognised as a Finalist at the 2024 "Excellence in Ecology and Economy Awards" by the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

Gardenia Philippines also achieved the "Circle of Excellence Award" for "Top Employer of the Year" at the Asia CEO Awards 2024 in recognition of the company's programs for its employees through the company's health and wellness programs, annual training plans, and other benefits for the employees' family members, reflecting Gardenia Philippines' commitment to best HR practices benefitting the employees.

For 2025, Gardenia Philippines is hopeful that the momentum seen towards the end of 2024 will be sustained as inflation eases. While the white bread segment continues to remain the largest, due to its availability and accessibility, on-the-go baked goods and healthy products continue to show promising growth potential. On-the-go baked products have been driven by the return to on-site activities and the rise in snacking among workers and students, as busy lifestyles fuel the need for convenient food products. Increasing consumer awareness of nutrition and wellness has also led to higher demand for healthier, functional food options. With this, Gardenia Philippines will continue to stay adaptable to changing market demands and engage in strategic actions to strengthen its position in existing areas and seize new growth opportunities.

Ben Foods (S) Pte Ltd,

NCS Cold Stores (S) Pte Ltd,

QAF Fruits Cold Store Pte Ltd

("Ben Foods Group")

Ben Foods Group has navigated through continued global supply chain challenges and the weaker market conditions due to inflationary pressures in 2024.

The food service channel remained a key pillar of Ben Foods Group's business, driven by meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibitions ("MICE") and tourism. Ben Foods Group also actively pursued the development of new export markets to build its business. Additionally, demand for warehousing sustained during 2024, enabling Ben Foods Group to maintain high occupancy rates.

To capitalise on existing and new business opportunities, Ben Foods Group engaged in aggressive promotions and efficient stock management strategies. Ben Foods Group also leveraged on its proprietary brands and expanded its product portfolio with offerings such as Cowhead granola, egg cookies, cheese slices, whipped butter, 3-in-1 premium coffee and milk tea, amongst others. As a testament to the strength of its proprietary brands, Ben Foods Group was awarded "Customer Favourite Brand 2024" by DFI Retail Group for the Cowhead brand.

Ben Foods Group remains committed to ensuring effective, safe and sustainable food management.

- A solar power system in QAF Fruits has been fully operational since early 2024. This initiative has generated cost savings and reduced the Group's carbon footprint.  
- Initiatives to reduce plastic use have also been implemented. For example, improved "U" shaped paper straws for Cowhead UHT Milk 200ml products and non-plastic, paper-wire for Cowhead pancakes are currently being used.  
- The environmental management system has been certified to ISO 14001, showing Ben Foods Group's commitment to improving environmental performance.  
- Ben Foods Group has also updated its accreditation for ISO 22000, showing its dedication to effective food safety management.

Ben Foods Group continues to contribute to the community through sponsorships and product donations. In 2024, Ben Foods Group supported fundraising efforts such as "Rice Ball 2024", organised by Wild Rice, and the "Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts Fundraising Golf Tournament". In addition, like in previous years, Ben Foods Group supported NTUC Food Drinks and Allied Workers Union's annual "Gift from the Heart 2024" by contributing Cowhead products for the gift bags that were distributed to the beneficiaries.

Looking ahead to 2025, Ben Foods Group expects market conditions to remain challenging, with higher operating cost pressures and increasing trade demands on the business. Ben Foods Group will remain steadfast in its growth strategy.

- Leveraging on its proprietary brands, Ben Foods Group will introduce new products in areas such as potatoes and snacks.  
- Ben Foods Group will also continue expanding its export markets, developing and growing its e-commerce and vending machine business, and reduce reliance on brick-and-mortar businesses.

Ben Foods Group will strive to maintain high occupancy rates for its warehousing business. Warehousing remains well-positioned in the market, with its prime location being an ideal choice for customers seeking reliable and cost-effective storage solutions.

# BOARD STATEMENT

[GRI 2-22]

The Board of Directors ("the Board") is dedicated to enhancing sustainability throughout the QAF Group. We seek to improve our approach year on year as we continue to integrate sustainability throughout our operations.

The Board is pleased to present its FY2024 Sustainability Report, which provides an update on our material environmental, social, and governance ("ESG") performance and our ESG initiatives for the Group, pursuant to the reporting requirements of SGX-ST Listing Rules 711A and 711B.

The Board assumes overall responsibility for the Group's sustainability direction and maintains oversight over the management and monitoring of QAF's material ESG factors. As part of the Board's oversight, the Board has confirmed that the material ESG topics reviewed in the prior year remain relevant to the Group for FY2024.

In efforts to continuously ensure our disclosures remain robust and relevant to the regulatory developments in sustainability reporting, we conducted a gap review of our sustainability disclosures against the International Sustainability Standards Board ("ISSB") IFRS S1 and S2 this year. Through this process, QAF has developed a phased approach towards alignment with the SGX RegCo's requirements for all issuers which begins its climate-related disclosures to IFRS S2 starting from FY2025.

This year, we have expanded our disclosures to include the energy consumption and GHG emissions of QAF's corporate office. We also re-examined our targets for material ESG topics and widened their scope. Whilst setting more measurable targets and creating greater alignment with our medium-term strategic goals, we have established new targets primarily related to quantitative mid-term objectives. We have also commenced a supplier climate risk assessment to better understand the effect of physical and transition risks on the Group's supply chain. More details of this assessment can be found on page 51. We have also conducted a preliminary Scope 3 emissions calculation exercise in line with GHG Protocol and identified material categories to our Group, allowing us to focus our efforts on improving data availability and quality.

We continue to channel our efforts into enhancing our performance and driving sustainability initiatives throughout our operations. As a food business, the safety and quality of our products, along with prioritising consumer and employee health and wellness, remains paramount for QAF. The QAF Group is dedicated to achieving excellence across all areas of our operations, and the formally recognised accomplishments received this year are a testament to our team's dedication and unwavering commitment to this goal. The Board is pleased to highlight several notable achievements in FY2024, which are detailed on page 34 of this report.

The food industry faces growing expectations to minimise environmental impact and enhance transparency. We recognise the need to stay agile and adaptable in navigating our business through a rapidly evolving landscape.

Looking ahead, we will continue to measure our sustainability progress and strive to create long-term value for our key stakeholders.

# SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

# SUSTAINABILITY AT QAF - QAF'S 5 PILLARS

At QAF, we believe sustainable growth is key to both our long-term success and the well-being of the communities and environment in which we operate. To guide our efforts, QAF has been utilising the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals ("SDG"s) 5Ps framework since FY2019, adapting it to fit our organisation's context. This adaptation includes the addition of "Products and Process". Our sustainability strategy focuses on "5Ps" - "Prosperity", "Products and Process", "Planet", "People", and "Peace and Partnerships". These 5 pillars help us tackle key environmental, economic, and social challenges in a transparent and measurable way.

We outline below the five key pillars of sustainability at QAF and describe how each contributes to our long-term vision for sustainable growth.

![](images/a140bce1f65e6e9c6b32d99d040e2d02f050223676fdb0613e6154aa207337c3.jpg)

1) Prosperity: Prosperity goes beyond financial success to encompass the ethical principles and governance frameworks that complement sustainable growth. We are committed to maintaining transparency and upholding high standards of integrity, guided by our robust business ethics and anti-corruption policies.  
2) Products and Process: We prioritise food safety and quality, with stringent standard operating procedures and quality management systems in place so as to achieve compliance with food safety standards. Bakery staff involved in food handling undergo regular food safety training to remain updated on food safety requirements and standards. We are also focused on promoting healthy lifestyles by offering diverse products that cater to various dietary preferences.  
3) Planet: The Group is focused on reducing our environmental impact and we have implemented solar panels and LED lighting at our facilities to reduce reliance on non-renewable energy. Together with our efforts in recycling and waste reduction, we work towards building a circular economy that lowers resource consumption.  
4) People: QAF Group promotes a diverse and inclusive workforce focused on employee well-being, while offering health and wellness programmes to support our employees. By investing in training, leadership development, and career advancement, we build a skilled and engaged workforce that drives QAF Group's long-term success.  
5) Peace and Partnerships: Our community support projects and disaster relief work, combined with strategic partnerships with non-governmental organisations ("NGOs") and government bodies, enable us to offer a positive impact on our communities.

# Our Approach towards Sustainable Growth

To strengthen our commitment to sustainable growth, the Group has also identified two priority SDGs to focus our efforts on. SDG 3 and SGD 12 were identified as these are most relevant to our material topics.

# Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages

As a food manufacturer, we are committed to delivering healthy products, advocating healthy consumption habits among our consumers and encouraging healthy lifestyles among our employees. We aim to work with schools and various organisations to promote Nutrition, Health and Wellness education. Through innovation, we believe we continue to work towards creating a portfolio that includes wholesome products with great taste. Beyond products, we work with our partners to promote healthy eating and active lifestyles.

# Sustainability Governance

[GRI 2-9, 2-12, 2-13, 2-14, 2-17]

Governance provides the framework necessary for a resilient and sustainable future. It involves implementing strategies, policies, and practices that align with QAF's sustainability goals.

The Board assumes overall responsibility for the Group's sustainability direction and delegates the oversight over sustainability reporting to the Audit and Risk Committee ("ARC"), which reports directly to the Board.

The ARC is tasked with overseeing and providing recommendations to the Board on sustainability reporting. Pursuant to this, the ARC is responsible for the approval of material economic, environmental, social, and governance ("EESG") factors identified during the materiality assessment, as well as the review of the Group's sustainability policies, practices, performance, and targets, including climate-related matters, for the purpose of such reporting. Refer to the responsibilities of the ARC in the Corporate Governance Report on page 109 for more information.

Supporting the ARC is the Sustainability Working Group, which includes a Joint Group Managing Director and Company executives from the Group head office. This group plays a more operationally focused role, working closely with the business units to fulfil the Group's commitment to positive sustainable advancements. The Sustainability Working Group formally reports to the ARC at each board committee meeting and provides both scheduled and ad-hoc updates between board committee meetings to keep the

# Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns

# Materiality Assessment

[GRI 2-29, 3-1]

QAF undertook a comprehensive four-step materiality assessment process in FY2022 which was reviewed again in FY2023. During this process, we engaged internal stakeholders to identify and assess the EESG topics of significance to the Group. This process takes into consideration Rule 711B(1) of the SGX-ST Listing Manual and draws guidance from certain GRI Standards.

The Board has reviewed the Group's material topics and concluded that the seven material EESG topics and one non-material topic identified remained relevant in FY2024.

Our materiality methodology adopts a data-driven approach to evaluate our material stakeholders' perspectives. Guided by the GRI Materiality Principle, the materiality assessment comprised the following steps:

Figure 2: Overview of materiality assessment methodology

# Identify Material EESG Factors

- An external trend analysis was conducted to identify an initial list of potential sustainability topics.  
- A scan of peers' disclosures was assessed, along with a review of global frameworks, such as the Global Reporting Initiative and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board.

# Rate Material EESG Factors

- Potential material topics were clustered to similar issues.  
- A rating process was used to assess which issues are pervasive and most common across the group.  
- Materiality is considered based on the interactions between QAF's value chain and its operating environment.

# Prioritise Material EESG Factors

- Internal stakeholders of the Group were engaged to prioritise the factors based on likelihood and impact.  
- The assessment takes into consideration relevance to the business, sustainability strategy and key stakeholders' expectations.  
- Based on inputs received from stakeholders, the list of material EESG topics were plotted in a matrix.

# Validate Factors

- The material topics were reviewed and endorsed by QAF management and approved by the Company's Audit and Risk Committee.  
- 7 material EESG topics and 1 non-material reporting EESG topic were finalised and to be disclosed in QAF's sustainability report.  
- The material topics are reviewed annually for their continuing relevance and to identify if there are other topics that should be included.

# SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

# Material Mapping and Topic Boundary

[GRI 3-2]

Guided by the GRI Standards and the SGX Practice Note 7.6 Sustainability Reporting Guide, the Group has identified the following material EESG topics displayed in the table below. These topics are categorised into five distinct pillars known as the 5Ps – “Prosperity”, “Products and Processes”, “Planet”, “People”, and “Peace and Partnerships”. The table highlights the significance of these material topics in relation to the Group's business and its material stakeholders.

# SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

# PROSPERITY

This pillar encompasses our commitment to robust economic performance as well as stringent ethical and fair business practices. Both material topics are core to achieving organisational excellence, and upholding strong corporate governance to maintain our company's growth and delivering value to shareholders.

# Economic Performance [Material topic]

[GRI 3-3]

Maintaining financial stability, achieving strong economic performance, and upholding our Corporate Governance principles are crucial for the strategic and sustainable long-term growth of the Group. This positively impacts our shareholders and other material stakeholders involved in our business.

Our economic performance is disclosed in the Chairman's Statement, Joint Group Managing Directors' Report and Financial Highlights as contained in our FY2024 Annual Report on pages 2 to 7 and is confirmed in the audited financial statements of the FY2024 Annual Report.

# Governance and Ethics: Ethical and Fair Business Practices [Material topic]

[GRI 2-15, 2-16, 2-25, 2-26, 2-27, 3-3]

# Corporate Governance

Our corporate governance is guided by the Singapore Code of Corporate Governance. For further details, please refer to our Corporate Governance Report, which is located on pages 91 to 116 of our FY2024 Annual Report.

# Anti-corruption

The board maintains a zero-tolerance stance towards all forms of fraud, corruption and unethical behaviour. The Group prioritises ethical conduct, transparency, and the effective management of conflicts of interest. Our Code of Business Ethics emphasises our commitment to conducting business with integrity and good ethical standards, and compliance with relevant anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws. Corrupt practices could expose both the Group and the individuals involved to criminal and civil liabilities, as well as damage the Group's reputation and the confidence of its material stakeholders. In addition to the Code of Business Ethics, certain entities within our Group have also implemented local policies tailored to their specific operational needs and jurisdictions.

# Whistleblowing Policy

The ARC is responsible for oversight and monitoring of whistleblowing. The Group has put in place a Whistleblowing Policy that provides an avenue for our officers and employees to raise, in confidence, concerns regarding actual or suspected improprieties on financial reporting, corruption, bribery, fraud and other matters, directly to the Chairman of the ARC or the Group Legal Counsel.

Under the Whistleblowing Policy, whistleblower raising genuine concerns in good faith are not at risk of losing their jobs or risk suffering from reprisal as a result, even if they are mistaken. The Company seeks to treat complaints in a confidential and sensitive manner. A complaint is only to be disclosed to persons in the Group on a need-to-know basis so as to carry out an investigation (subject to exceptions such as legal and regulatory requirements to disclose). The ARC considers the concerns raised, and, amongst others, if there are grounds for proceeding further with the case, may consult relevant persons from the Group as necessary, conduct its own investigation or review and/or instruct parties such as the internal or external auditors and lawyers to conduct further investigations or review.

# Tax Governance

Strong tax governance and tax risk management are essential to good corporate governance. Tax governance encompasses a well-defined and communicated corporate policy on taxation that is approved at a senior level of a company and reflects the attitude and culture of the company towards managing its tax risks. Tax risk management involves implementing a robust tax control framework to identify, mitigate and monitor key tax risks on an ongoing basis.

A company that adopts strong tax governance and risk management practices instills confidence in its stakeholders and the general public by demonstrating transparency in its tax matters and contributing its fair share of taxes.

The Company's Tax Governance Policy with respect to its Singapore based operations was submitted to the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore ("IRAS") for endorsement under the Tax Governance Framework programme. This was approved by IRAS in May 2024. Through a strong corporate governance culture and practice, QAF Group is committed to ensure accurate, transparent and timely submission of tax returns. Business strategies pursued are supported by bona-fide commercial and economic circumstances, and in compliance with relevant tax laws. The Company's Joint Group Managing Director, assisted by the Chief Financial Officer and Tax Vice President, escalate tax matters based on the materiality threshold to the Board and ARC.

# SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

QAF continues to participate in the IRAS Goods and Services Tax ("GST") - Assisted Compliance Assurance Programme ("ACAP"). In recognition of its efforts in ensuring GST compliance and its commitment to incorporate GST risk management as part of good corporate governance, QAF was awarded a five-year "ACAP Premium" status from 2021 to 2026.

# Governance and Ethics: Data Protection and Cybersecurity [Material topic]

[GRI 3-3]

Data protection and cybersecurity have been identified as key areas of focus in our Group, especially as we integrate more technology into our operations. In response to the increasing frequency and complexity of cyber threats and data breaches, the Group is dedicated to enhancing our protective measures and preparedness to secure our data and guarding against cyberattacks. We achieve this by focusing on three core pillars across the group: Process (mitigation measures), Technology (system security), and People (cybersecurity awareness education).

# Must-Know IT Policy

The Group has established a comprehensive IT policy, the "Must Know IT Policy", which outlines the guidelines for the secure usage of email, internet, antivirus software, password protocols, personal data protection, and data and information classification. This policy is easily accessible to all employees and is subject to regular reviews and updates. During the year, we updated the policy to include the safe and secure use of Generative AI tools while protecting individual and company information.

Key features of QAF's Group IT Policy are highlighted below in Figure 3.

# Email Use Policy

A set of protocols outlining the proper use of email within QAF, including guidelines for email communication, strategies to recognise phishing attempts and how to react, and maintaining the confidentiality of data.

Some of our best practices regarding data protection and cybersecurity are highlighted below.

# Data Backup and Recovery

The Group recognises the critical need for reliable systems and data backup and recovery processes, encompassing both on-site and off-site backups. Regular backup of essential data to secure storage and maintaining reliable backup procedures are vital for prompt data restoration in case of data loss, system malfunctions, or security breaches like ransomware attacks.

Our IT team conducts and validates technical restorations on a regular basis to confirm data availability and recoverability. Additionally, we perform IT disaster recovery exercises on key operational and financial systems and data.

# SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

# Incident Response Management

To build cyber resilience and enhance our ability to respond and recover effectively, we have standardised our cybersecurity incident response management at the QAF corporate office since FY2023. This entailed the formation of a Crisis Management Team and Cyber Incident Response Team, defining their roles and responsibilities, and outlining the incident response process.

In FY2024, our key business units, including GBPI, GBKL, GFS, BFS and BMA, have also established their incident response process and formed their Crisis Management Team and Cyber Incident Response Team.

# Investing in People (the Human Firewall)

We recognise that our employees are crucial in combating cyber threats. To foster a culture of cybersecurity awareness and responsibility across the group, we continuously educate our staff through various initiatives. These include:

- Distributing monthly newsletters on cyber related news and tips to employees so that they are kept abreast of recent cyber incidents and best practices to identify, detect, protect, and respond to social engineering and email phishing.  
Conducting annual cybersecurity awareness training and assessment.  
Conducting annual simulated email phishing exercise to validate employees' preparedness and readiness.

In FY2024, we conducted an online training and assessment on our cyber incident response process and management for QAF corporate office's Crisis Management Team and Cyber Incident Response Team.

# Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing

In FY2024, we conducted a vulnerability assessment and penetration testing for QAF corporate office and our business units, including GBPI, GBKL, GFS, BFS, BMM, FLM and BMA.

In FY2023, QAF conducted its first climate risk assessment for operations located in Singapore, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Australia. The climate risk assessment provided an understanding of climate change impacts on our business strategy, operations, and financial position under different climate scenarios, and enabled the group to assess its resilience across various time horizons to better prepare for future impacts. 
The assessment involved in-depth research into various climate-related physical and transition risks, categorising and assessing the relevance and impact of each risk to QAF. QAF adopted two climate scenarios and three time-horizons as part of the climate scenario analysis. The first scenario aligns with the 2015 Paris Agreement target of limiting global temperature rise to within 2°C above pre-industrial levels. The second scenario reflects a continuation of historical patterns in development. The analysis was conducted across short-term (by 2025), medium-term (by 2030), and long-term (by 2050) time horizons, which were selected based on our business operations and a landscape study on appropriate timeframes. The categorisation of risks was conducted in reference to QAF&#x27;s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework.</td><td>Climate-Risk Assessment</td></tr></table>

Transition risks are anticipated to be impactful for QAF over the medium- and long-term time horizons, especially under the net zero scenario, where customer preferences and regulations shift towards a sustainable and low-carbon economy. Conversely, physical risks such as changes in precipitation and rising average temperatures are set to be more apparent under the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario.Impact of climate-related risks and opportunitiesThe use of qualitative climate scenario analysis offers QAF comprehensive insights into the potential impact of climate-related risks and opportunities across various assumptions, trends, pathways, and hypotheses. The impacts of both physical and transition risks to QAF&#x27;s operations are further elaborated within the tables below on pages 54 to 56.To address these risks, the Group has implemented mitigation measures to reduce inherent risks and ensure business resilience, also detailed on pages 54 to 56. As part of ongoing efforts to enhance and optimise operations, QAF consistently reviews its mitigation strategies and adopts a forward-thinking management approach. For example, as a manufacturer and wholesaler, QAF is committed to minimising the effects of increased energy costs associated with greenhouse gas emissions by implementing energy-efficient technologies and optimising production processes.To address material physical risks, QAF is evaluating flood protection measures and backup power sources at its most vulnerable sites to minimise disruption to production and operations. Contingency plans are being developed to diminish the risk of loss in production in the event of disruption at one or more locations. Additionally, QAF will also consider physical risk of current locations when evaluating any extension of current leased premises, and implementation of relevant measures when upgrading facilities. Currently, risk mitigation measures are not critical over the shorter term but are being evaluated for future implementation ahead of medium to long-term impacts. Nevertheless, QAF remains vigilant and will assess and modify its strategy as required.</td><td></td></tr></table>

* QAF, with core businesses in Bakery, and Distribution and Warehousing, relies on a diverse network of suppliers across different countries. However, these suppliers are exposed to climate-related risks both physical and transition-related, which can disrupt supply chains, increase production costs and have an indirect financial impact on QAF.

To address this, a desktop study was conducted in FY2024 to evaluate the climate risks faced by our key ingredient suppliers, taking into account the countries of origin of their raw materials. This assessment evaluated both the impact comprising exposure and vulnerability as well as the likelihood of the risk affecting QAF. This analysis was conducted for different time horizons and climate scenarios.

# Resource Management [Material topic]

[GRI 3-3]

The careful management of natural resources is crucial to sustainable existence. Over-exploitation of resources can lead to damaged ecosystems and negatively impact human rights, while responsible management can lead to positive environmental, economic and social outcomes.

We are committed to responsibly managing vital resources such as energy and water by continuously monitoring our practices. Our goal is to reduce energy consumption and waste generation, thereby minimising our environmental impact and contributing to a healthier planet.

# Energy Management

[GRI 3-3]

The Group optimises our energy consumption to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and operating expenses. This is achieved through regular monitoring of our energy usage and evaluating available energy efficiency solutions and renewable energy technology.

The Group's energy management initiatives across its facilities include:

1) The implementation of solar technology to generate renewable energy.

- As of 31 December 2024, the Group has approximately 7,600 square metres ("sqm") (FY2023: 4,800 sqm) of solar panels in operation. Solar panels are installed in the key geographical locations of Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines and Australia. Refer to "Key case study" section for more details.  
- Gardenia Singapore has initiated a pilot project aimed at testing the feasibility of standalone solar lighting. Fourteen solar-powered lighting fixtures were set up to enhance energy savings and energy efficiency.

2) Heat recovery system

- A heat recovery system is in use at one of our factories in Malaysia. This system produces hot water directly from the condensers of the factory cooling system, instead of using electrical heaters to heat water separately. The hot water is used to clean the cream roll injectors and bread cooler conveyors. A similar heat recovery system is also in use at one of the factories of GBKL.

3) Roof repainting

- Repainting of roofs in white at 2 plants in the Philippines has reduced temperatures inside the plants.

4) Use of energy efficient technologies

Installation and use of LED lights and sensor activated lighting at the Group's factories, offices and warehouses.  
- Utilising energy efficient technology such as inverter-type air-conditioning units with energy-saving features, enhancing cooling efficiency while minimising energy usage and the deployment of capacitor banks in electrical systems to improve power factor and reduce energy wastage.

# SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

# Key case study

Since FY2017, the Group has implemented solar technology to generate renewable energy, with the first solar panels being installed at Bakers Maison Australia followed by at GBKL's facility in Malaysia since FY2021.

# Singapore:

In Q4 2023, QAF Fruits installed 2,800 sqm of solar panels, which became operational in January 2024. For 2024, the solar panels generated more than 693,000 kWh of renewable energy. This translates to a reduction of over 285 tonnes of CO2 emissions.

# Philippines:

Approximately 1,217 sqm of solar panels have been installed at our Group's Laguna plant since FY2023. For FY2024, the solar panels at its Laguna plant generated more than 314,000 kWh of renewable energy. The use of renewable energy also led to a reduction of over 251 tonnes of CO2 emissions.

In 1H 2024, Gardenia Philippines has commenced installation of approximately 1,250 sqm of solar panels at its Cagayan de Oro plant. The solar panels are expected to be operational in 1Q 2025.

[GRI 2-4, 302-1, 302-3, 305-1, 305-2, 305-4]

The Group closely monitors its energy consumption and Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, measured in line with the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard ("GHG Protocol") methodology. We have identified key climate metrics and targets as mentioned in "Climate Risk Management and Reporting (TCFD disclosures)" section. Our energy consumption and the corresponding Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions disclosures are gathered from all aspects of our operations, across our operating markets as per the reporting scope defined on page 82. In 2024, the Group has expanded our disclosures to include energy consumption and GHG emissions of QAF corporate office.

The energy consumption of QAF Group (Bakery, GBKL JV, D&W and corporate office) are presented into two categories – production and operations, and transport-related activities. Whilst we expect an increase in energy usage in the coming years due to our ongoing efforts to expand business volumes, we are committed to managing our energy consumption proactively, through initiatives such as implementing solar power projects and enhancing our focus on energy efficiency throughout the Group.

The disclosure of energy intensity is presented on a per metric tonne (production volume) basis, given that production constitutes a substantial portion of our business. With the expected growth of our business, monitoring of intensity will provide insights to our energy efficiency performance.

Note: As production volume is not relevant in the context of Distribution and Warehousing segment and QAF HQ, disclosure of intensity cannot be provided.  
* Minor restatements of FY2023 data have been made which have not materially impacted prior year disclosures.

In 2023, the Group's GHG emissions was 96,718.43 tCO2e for Scope 1 and 83,047.80 tCO2e for Scope 2. In 2024, there was a reduction in emissions, with Scope 1 decreasing to 94,193.59 tCO2e, representing a  $2.61\%$  decrease from the previous year. Similarly, Scope 2 emissions decreased to 82,274.68 tCO2e, representing a  $0.93\%$  reduction from the previous year.

In our analysis of emissions intensity, we concentrated on our Bakery segment and GBKL JV, which saw a decrease of  $0.27\%$  and  $3.13\%$  respectively from the previous year. This decrease was primarily due to the reduced usage of refrigerants, which caused a reduction in fugitive emissions under Scope 1, and the adoption of solar renewable energy by QAFF and Gardenia Philippines, which contributed to reduced Scope 2 emissions. Solar panels were only operational at QAFF and GBPI since 1Q2024 and 2H2023.

# SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

# Waste Management

[GRI 3-3, 306-2]

The Group is conscious of our environmental footprint, and we aim to better manage and reduce our waste through continuous improvement by reducing, reusing and recycling ("3R") the by-products generated in our factories.

As part of the mandatory requirement of the National Environment Agency (Singapore) ("NEA") for 3R Plans, the Group's two key subsidiaries in Singapore, Gardenia and Ben Foods, have also submitted their mandatory packaging data and 3R plans to the NEA since 2022.

# Reduce

The Group aims to reduce plastic and paper usage. We are exploring the reduction of plastic packaging thickness for some of our products. For example, Gardenia Singapore, a signatory to the Singapore Packaging Agreement, started to reduce the packaging thickness for some Gardenia products since 2022. This initiative has resulted in a reduction of about  $4,669\mathrm{kg}$  of plastic from FY2022 to FY2024. Gardenia Singapore plans to extend these reductions to more Gardenia products in FY2025.

As part of its ongoing commitment to reducing plastic use in product packaging, Ben Foods Singapore is transitioning to more sustainable packaging solutions. Since FY2022, its Cowhead UHT Milk 200ml products were packaged with paper straws instead of plastic straws. For its Cowhead pancake range, BFS has phased out the white plastic-wire clips in October 2024, replacing them with non-plastic, paper-wire alternatives.

Gardenia Singapore has also encouraged consumers to 'go green' by distributing reusable non-woven shopping bags and reusable sandwich boxes with purchase of selected Gardenia loaves.

The Group is transitioning to paperless transactions to reduce paper consumption and wastage.

# Reuse

In addition to reducing the amount of food waste produced, the group is also focusing on increasing its reuse. In FY2024, BMA donated approximately 151 tonnes (FY2023: 121 tonnes) of edible bread and pastry dough waste to local farmers. The waste is utilised as animal feed. Gardenia Philippines has diverted more than 15,000 tonnes of bread waste to fish meal

in FY2024. During the year, Gardenia Singapore continued to work with several local start-ups, such as Less & Co, which upcycles unsold bread into beverages for Food Service and Retailers, and Prefer, which produces bean-free coffee. Since December 2024, Gardenia Singapore has also commenced on a community project to provide market surplus bread every week to beneficiaries of the Food From The Heart organisation and It's Raining Raincoats.

# Recycle

The Group aims to recycle the cardboard and plastic we use. We have set up recycling programmes where we collect corrugated board and plastic waste from our factories and warehouses, and send them to recycling plants. In FY2024, Ben Foods Singapore recycled approximately 89 tonnes of corrugated cardboard, 8 tonnes of plastic and 0.4 tonnes of paper. Since FY2017, BMA has been recycling the cardboard waste it generates. In FY2024, it recycled approximately 64 tonnes. To reduce cardboard usage, BMA also introduced reusable food grade plastic crates in its production facility instead of using cardboard cartons. Gardenia Philippines also continued their waste segregation processes to divert recyclable materials away from landfill.

The Group is currently working towards collecting waste generation data from our operations.

Ben Foods Singapore is transitioning to more sustainable packaging solutions, such as use of paper straws instead of plastic straws for Cowhead UHT milk range, as well as use of paper-wire clips instead of plastic-wire clips for Cowhead Pancakes range.

# SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

# Key case study

Since FY2023, Gardenia Philippines, through its partner facility, started to recycle product packaging into school chairs, which are then donated to local schools. This innovative approach not only reduces packaging waste, but also provides school-going children with valuable classroom furniture. To-date, Gardenia Philippines has donated 300 school chairs. In FY2024, Gardenia Philippines partnered with local government units to broaden the impact of the plastic collection drive within local communities, resulting in an estimated collection of almost 2,200 kg of plastics. The plastics can be recycled to make more than 70 school chairs, which are scheduled for donation to schools in FY2025.

# Water Management

[GRI 3-3, 303-2]

Water is a fundamental resource in the food industry. Our bakery operations are heavily reliant on water consumption for the manufacturing of its products. Hence, it is vital that we monitor and manage our water consumption to avoid depletion of a local resource. To optimise water usage within their operations, Gardenia Philippines has invested in water conservation technologies. The Group's factory in Johor also harvests rainwater for toilet flushing.

The Group is currently working towards collecting water consumption data from our operations.

In our operations, we discharge wastewater. We are committed to adhering to the applicable regulations and wastewater requirements of local authorities when discharging wastewater to the sewers. At our bakeries, oil interceptors and strainers are used to prevent oil, grease, or sludge from entering the sewers. The interceptors are inspected, cleaned, and regularly maintained. Where required by the local authorities, testing and monitoring of standard effluent parameters are performed at an accredited laboratory, and test reports are submitted to the respective local authorities. These tests encompass critical factors such as pH value, discharge temperature, oil and grease content, biological oxygen demand, and total suspended solids.

# Occupational Health and Safety ("OHS")

[GRI 3-3, 403-1, 403-2, 403-3, 403-4, 403-5, 403-6]

Creating a high-quality working environment is essential for QAF Group's continued success. Inadequate health and safety procedures lead to higher injury rates and lost workdays, and can adversely affect employee performance and disrupt our operations. The Group is committed to creating a healthy, safe, and inclusive workplace that supports the well-being of our employees.

To support this commitment, we have established OHS policies at all our bakeries. This year, two major D&W subsidiaries, Ben Foods Singapore and NCS Cold Stores, also implemented OHS policies. Our OHS policies and procedures comply with the local OHS regulations of the respective countries in which we operate, and aim to reduce or minimise workplace hazards and occupational illnesses. We identify and assess work-related hazards and risks through a risk assessment conducted for new processes and activity at least once every 3 years. A hierarchy of controls is employed to manage potential hazards and reduce risks. The controls include Elimination (physically removing the hazard), Substitution (replacing the hazard), Engineering Controls (isolating people from the hazard), Administrative Controls (changing the way people work), and wearing of Personal Protective Equipment. Where required, our manufacturing facilities are also subject to audits or inspections by the local Safety and Health regulators or external vendors at least once every 3 years.

We have established Safety Committees which conduct meetings on a regular basis to discuss workplace hazards, injuries and any safety-related concerns. The committees discuss preventive and corrective actions for safety incidents and other necessary precautionary measures to prevent these incidents happening in the future. As an additional safeguard, employees can confidentially report safety concerns without fear of retaliation, in line with the Group's Whistleblowing Policy.

We also provide OHS training for employees in areas such as Workplace Safety and Health, Occupational First Aid, Forklift Safety, Chemical Handling, Safe Driving, Fire Fighting, Emergency Response, Scaffold Awareness, Safety in Confined Spaces, and Safety when Performing Work at Height. Such training is conducted at least once every 2 years so that our employees are equipped with the knowledge to perform their duties in a safe manner and know how to respond effectively to emergencies or workplace accidents.

OHS initiatives implemented at some of our bakery facilities include:

Employees working in areas with high noise levels are provided with hearing protection to reduce noise exposure. Production employees also undergo mandatory annual audiometric examinations to monitor their hearing health.  
- Other Personal Protective Equipment, such as safety harness, safety shoes, gloves and goggles, are also provided for production employees.  
- Chemical health risk assessments were also performed to assess the level of chemicals which our employees are exposed to, and to assess the effectiveness of personal protective equipment to reduce or eliminate employees' risks of chemical exposure.

# Key case studies

# Promoting Public Awareness on Mental Health

As a brand integral to many households, Gardenia understands the significance of the family as a pillar of society. Amidst rising mental health challenges, we are dedicated to fostering public knowledge on maintaining mental health through our brand's educational outreach.

Examples of our initiatives conducted during the year include:

# Supporting Teenage Mental Health

Under the #GardeniaCares Wellness Begins at Home campaign, Gardenia Malaysia continued its collaboration with NobleDr+, a non-governmental organisation that promotes Mental Health Programme for teenagers at schools called #beMINDful. Its main goal is to provide more extensive awareness on making mental health a priority and reducing stigma, in line with the World Health Organisation's vision of "Make mental health for all a global priority". For 2024, the collaboration with NobleDr focused on providing screening and intervention for school students at Sekolah Jenis Kebangsaan Tamil. It also promoted awareness about mental health among parents and students, and encouraged more people to normalise speaking up about their mental health and be comfortable to seek help.

# Promoting Mental Health in the Workplace

To commemorate World Mental Health Day, Gardenia Singapore sponsored wholemeal bread to hospital staff at the Mental Wellness Fair organised by Mount Alvernia Wellness Centre, to show our support in encouraging conversation about mental health in the workplace.

# Caring for Our Environment

Since 2014, Gardenia Philippines has been actively engaged in tree planting activities. In 2024, employee volunteers planted over 2,000 seedlings. Additionally, Gardenia Philippines has been recognised by the Laguna Lake Development Authority as a "Pagkilala at Pasasalamat" (To Recognise and to Acknowledge) awardee for its invaluable contributions and unwavering support towards the organisation's campaigns, including coastal clean-up drives.

# Energy

This report covers non-renewable electricity consumption (purchased electricity), renewable electricity consumption (solar generation) and non-renewable fuel consumption (natural gas, diesel use and liquified petroleum gas).  
- Total energy consumption within the organisation is calculated in Joules and presented under the categories of 'production and operations' and 'transport-related activities'.  
The conversion factor used to convert kilowatt-hours (kWh) to terajoules (TJ) is 3.6e-6.  
- Energy intensity is derived by taking total energy consumption from production and operations activities (in terajoules) divided by the total production volume (in MT). This offers a representation of energy efficiency specifically in our primary business activities. The production volume used for bakery is 178,027.17 MT and for GBKL is 138,418.23 MT.  
- As production volume is not relevant in the context of Distribution and Warehousing segment and QAF HQ, disclosure of intensity cannot be provided.

# GHG Emissions

- The GHG emissions are reported in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. Our methodology employs the operational control approach, where we take responsibility for GHG emissions from operations under its direct control. CO2e emissions are estimated based on the conversion factors from Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ("IPCC") Guidelines AR4 and 5 for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.  
- Direct (scope 1) and indirect (scope 2) emissions are included in the calculation. CO2, CH4 and N2O is included in the calculation of the GHG emissions. Scope 2 emission uses a location-based method.

# SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

- Direct (scope 1) and indirect (scope 2) emissions are calculated in tonnes of CO2 equivalent ("tCO2e") and presented under the categories of 'production and operations' and 'transport-related activities'.  
- Direct (scope 1) and indirect (scope 2) emissions are included in the calculation of the GHG emissions intensity.  
- Emission intensity is derived by taking total emissions from production and operations (in tCO2e) divided by the total production volume (in MT). This offers a representation of emission efficiency specifically in our primary business activities.  
- For FY2024 data, the production volume used for emission intensity calculation is similar to that used for energy intensity calculation, which is 178,027.17 MT for bakery and 138,418.23 MT for GBKL.  
- As production volume is not relevant in the context of Distribution and Warehousing segment and QAF HQ, disclosure of intensity cannot be provided.

# GRI G4 FP5 (Percentage of production of volume manufactured in sites certified by an independent third party according to internationally recognised food safety management system standards)

This report identifies the sites that have undergone third-party certification for internationally recognised food safety management system standards, considering the total production volume.  
The denominator is the total production volume of all the sites operated by the reporting organisation where products are manufactured.  
This report calculates the percentage in accordance with GRI G4 FP5 by dividing the production volume certified by an independent third party for internationally recognised food safety management system standards across all the Bakery entities of the reporting organisation where products are manufactured to get the percentage.

# OHS

- OHS Management Systems refers to a set of interrelated or interacting elements to establish an occupational health and safety policy and objectives, and to achieve those objectives. This definition is based on the International Labour Organisation (ILO), Guidelines on Occupational Safety and Health Management Systems, ILO-OSH 2001, 2001.

# Consumer Health and Safety

- Incidents of non-compliance with regulations and/or voluntary codes concerns the direct health and safety impacts of products and services on consumers.

# Employees

An individual who is in an employment relationship with the organisation. All employee data relates to the headcount as of 31 December 2024.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

(As at 17 March 2025)

In this Corporate Governance Report, QAF Limited ("QAF" or the "Company") describes its corporate governance practices for the financial year ended 31 December 2024 ("FY2024") with specific reference to the principles and provisions of the Code of Corporate Governance 2018 ("Code"). This report makes cross-references to certain sections of the Annual Report such as information on our Directors on pages 10 to 14 and our sustainability approach on pages 29 to 90. For completeness, this report should be read in conjunction with the other reports and information in the Annual Report.

The Company recognises the importance of sound corporate governance practices. It focuses on the substance and objective of the Principles underpinning the Code's Provisions whilst pursuing its corporate objectives and strategy of long-term sustainable growth and value creation. Where there were variations in the Company's corporate governance practices from the Provisions, explanation as to how the Company's practices were consistent with the intent of the Principle in question is provided in the relevant paragraph of this report.

# THE BOARD'S CONDUCT OF AFFAIRS

Principle 1: The company is headed by an effective Board which is collectively responsible and works with Management for the long-term success of the company.

(1) Provisions 1.1, 1.3, 1.4 and 1.5

The Board of Directors of QAF ("Board") is responsible for overall corporate governance, strategic direction and formulation of broad policies to oversee the business performance and affairs of QAF and its subsidiaries (the "Group"), with a view to achieving long-term success for the Company. The Board also provides leadership, reviews the performance of the Management, and has oversight of the proper conduct of the Group's business including the framework for the Group's system of internal controls and risk management. Please also refer to the Company's Sustainability Report found on pages 29 to 90 of the Annual Report which sets out the Board's Statement and other information on the Company's sustainability approach as well as information on the Group's Code of Business Conduct.

The functions of the Board are carried out by the Board or delegated by it to various Board Committees. The Board has in place the following Board Committees: Audit & Risk Committee, Nominating Committee and Remuneration Committee. The members of these Committees are set out in the Corporate Information page of the Annual Report.

Each Committee has written terms of reference including the authority to examine issues relevant to its terms of reference and to approve and/or make recommendations to the Board for consideration. A summary of the terms of reference and the activities of the Committees are more particularly described in other sections of this report. The implementation of the long-term vision and strategy for the Company as formulated by the Board is tasked to the executive Directors. Management works with, and is accountable to, the Board. In its review of the performance of Management, the Nominating Committee and the Remuneration Committee, as the case may be, consider several factors such as those set out on pages 98 to 101 of this report under Principle 5 "Provisions 5.1 and 5.2" and Principle 7 "Provisions 7.1 and 7.3".

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

(As at 17 March 2025)

During FY2024, the Board held two scheduled meetings in connection with the review of the Group's financial results announcements. The Company's practice is to hold additional Board and Committee meetings and discussions, whether by physical or electronic means or a combination of both, as and when circumstances warrant. Where a Director faces conflicts of interest, he shall recuse himself from discussions and decisions on the relevant matter. The FY2024 attendance and participation of the Directors at such Board and Committee meetings as well as the Company's Annual General Meeting ("AGM") in April 2024, is set out below:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Board</td><td>Audit &amp; Risk Committee</td><td>Nominating Committee</td><td>Remuneration Committee</td><td>AGM</td></tr><tr><td>Number of meetings held in FY2024</td><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Name of Director</td><td colspan="5">Number of meetings attended in FY2024</td></tr><tr><td>Lam Sing Chung</td><td>2</td><td>N/A</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Philip Yeo Liat Kok</td><td>2</td><td>N/A</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Lin Kejian</td><td>1</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Michael Darren Hewat</td><td>2</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Dawn Pamela Lum</td><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Norman Ip</td><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Chee Teck Kwong Patrick</td><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Lian Hwee Peng Rebecca</td><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Aw Syee Chia</td><td>2</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Loh Wee Lee(1)</td><td>1</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Ong Wui Leng(2)</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr></table>

(1) Appointed Director with effect from 1 June 2024.  
(2) Ceased to be a Director with effect from 20 February 2024.

The other directorships and principal commitments held by the Directors have not compromised the time and attention devoted by them to the discharge of their duties to the Company. Please also refer to the disclosures under Principle 4 "Provision 4.5" at page 98 of this report.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

(As at 17 March 2025)

# (2) Provision 1.2

Newly-appointed Directors of the Company are given orientation including briefings to familiarise them with the business and operations of the Group. They are furnished with information on their fiduciary and other general duties and obligations, and on the Company's governance framework, policies and/or processes.

Directors are provided the opportunity to develop and maintain their skills and knowledge on areas relevant to their duties as directors of a public-listed company and to their roles on Board Committees, such as those organised by the Singapore Institute of Directors, Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority and/or the SGX-ST. The Company funds and makes arrangements for the Directors to attend such training. The Management (with the assistance of external consultants, where considered appropriate) furnishes the Directors with information pertinent to the Group's business, including information to keep them apprised of material issues and developments, both locally and in other jurisdictions, relevant to the Group's businesses, changes in laws, listing rules or accounting matters and regulatory and compliance issues. In addition, Directors are at liberty to request for further explanations, briefings or information as and when required.

# (3) Provisions 1.6 and 1.7

The Management provides Directors with periodic management financial information relating to the Group as well as information on material matters and issues being dealt with by Management. Board papers are prepared for each meeting of the Board and are normally circulated at least five days in advance of each meeting to allow sufficient lead time for Directors to review the items tabled at the meetings. The Management is required to supply the Board with papers containing adequate information pertaining to the agenda (including, where applicable, budgets, forecasts and analyses) to assist the Directors' review of the issues to be considered at Board meetings and to facilitate discussion at such meetings. Directors are at liberty to request from the Management additional information as needed to make an informed decision and to discharge their responsibilities.

The Directors have separate and independent access to relevant Management and the Company Secretary. The Company Secretary attends all Board meetings and her responsibilities include checking that board procedures are followed, applicable rules and regulations, including the listing rules and the Code, are complied with and that minutes of meetings are fairly recorded. The Company Secretary is also tasked with handling information flow within the Board and its Committees. The Constitution of the Company provides that the Company Secretary shall be appointed and may be removed by the Directors.

If Directors, whether as a group or individually, in furtherance of their duties need independent professional advice, assistance is available to help them obtain such advice at the Company's expense.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

(As at 17 March 2025)

# BOARD COMPOSITION AND GUIDANCE

Principle 2: The Board has an appropriate level of independence and diversity of thought and background in its composition to enable it to make decisions in the best interests of the company.

(1) Provisions 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4

As at 31 December 2024, the Board comprised 10 Directors, seven of whom were, in the Board's judgement, independent. Our independent Directors are Mr Philip Yeo Liat Kok (who is Vice-Chairman of the Board), Ms Dawn Pamela Lum, Mr Norman Ip, Mr Chee Teck Kwong Patrick, Dr Lian Hwee Peng Rebecca, Mr Aw Syee Chia and Mr Loh Wee Lee. A majority of the Board comprises (a) independent Directors, namely, seven out of 10; and (b) non-executive Directors, namely, eight out of 10.

The independence of each Director is reviewed annually by the Nominating Committee (with the relevant Nominating Committee member abstaining in respect of himself/herself). In its deliberation on the independence of Directors in respect of FY2024, the Nominating Committee took into account, amongst others, each independent Director's confirmation of his or her independence based on the applicable provisions of the SGX-ST Listing Manual and the Code. Under the Listing Manual, a director is not independent if (a) he is or has, in the last three financial years, been employed by the company or any of its related corporations; or (b) he has an immediate family member who is or has, in the last three financial years, been employed by the company or any of its related corporations, and whose remuneration is or was determined by the remuneration committee; or (c) he has been a director for an aggregate period of more than nine years, whether before or after listing (such director may continue to be considered independent until the conclusion of the next annual general meeting of the issuer). These disqualifying provisions did not apply to any of our independent Directors for FY2024. The Nominating Committee also considered the principle-based definition of "independence" in the Code (set out in Provision 2.1), which states that an independent director is one who is independent in conduct, character and judgement, and has no relationship with the company, its related corporations, its substantial shareholders or its officers that could interfere, or be reasonably perceived to interfere, with the exercise of the director's independent business judgement in the best interests of the company. The Board is of the view that the Board has an appropriate level of independence and that the size of the Board, and that of the Board Committees, is also appropriate. Ms Dawn Pamela Lum will step down from the Board and her Board Committee positions at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting on 25 April 2025 due to the expiry of her nine-year tenure as an independent director pursuant to Rule 210(5)(d)(iv) of the SGX-ST Listing Manual. A review of the composition of the Board and its Committees is currently being undertaken and the Company expects to complete this process by mid-2025 and will announce any updates at its conclusion.

For the selection, appointment and re-appointment of Directors, the Board has a Board Diversity Policy that covers diversity factors such as skills & experience, age and gender for the purpose of enhancing Board effectiveness and in the context of the needs and future plans of the Group. Certain information on the diversity of the Company's Board (including Alternate Director) for FY2024 is set out below.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

(As at 17 March 2025)

The Board does not intend pursuant to the Board Diversity Policy to appoint persons as Directors by reason of their gender or age as token representatives on the Board or simply to meet quotas. In the Board's view, the fundamental principle is that the candidate must be of the right fit, taking into account the needs and future plans of the Group's businesses, and must meet the relevant needs and vision of the Board and Company at the material time. The pursuit of quotas, if any, and targets should take this overriding principle into account. Under the Company's Board Diversity Policy, the Nominating Committee shall, in this context, review annually the relevant targets for promoting Board diversity and make its recommendations with accompanying plans and timelines for consideration and approval by the Board. The Nominating Committee shall also undertake an annual review of the Board's composition with the Policy in mind (including succession planning), review key selection criteria as well as different channels for sourcing candidates. It is to report and make recommendations to the Board accordingly. With respect to the following elements of diversity, the Company's targets in the context of the Board Diversity Policy are as follows:

In respect of skills & experience, as disclosed in 2023 in the Company's FY2022 Annual Report, the Company's target was to appoint by FY2026 at least one more Director with experience relevant to our business and future plans, for example in the food industry or a related industry. Business opportunities and threats are constantly evolving and a diverse combination of in-depth skills & experience, such as extensive relevant experience in the food industry or a related industry, would enhance the quality and effectiveness of the Board and its performance. This target took into consideration the pre-existing skillsets and experience of Board members. As to the Company's progress towards this target, in FY2023, the Company appointed Mr Michael Darren Hewat to the Board as Joint Group Managing Director. Mr Hewat has experience in the food including distribution industry, having been chief executive officer of the Group's Primary Production business prior to its disposal. In FY2024, the Company appointed an independent Director, Mr Loh Wee Lee, who has experience with a major Pan-Asian retail group which offers a wide range of products.

In respect of age, the Company had also in its FY2022 Annual Report, disclosed its target of having over the subsequent three years (ie, 2023 to 2026) a mix of both younger and more senior Directors, with heavier emphasis being on depth of experience, track record and business and other networks. In the light of this principle, the Company's objective is to have a Board where more than  $50\%$  of the Directors are within the age group of 51 and above. The Company currently meets this target percentage.

In respect of gender, the Company had disclosed its target of maintaining a Board with female representation of at least  $25\%$  for the subsequent three years (ie, 2023 to 2026). The Company also noted that a target of  $25\%$  female representation on the boards of Singapore listed companies by 2025 was set in 2019 by the Council for Board Diversity. As at 31 December 2024, approximately  $27\%$  of the Company's Board (including Alternate Director) comprised female Directors.

Taking into consideration the above, the Nominating Committee believes that the Board comprises Directors who as a group have an appropriate balance and mix (as well as breadth and depth) of skills, knowledge and experience, and diversity of thought and background, so as to foster constructive debate and avoid "groupthink". Board members have diverse backgrounds, skillsets and experience (including extensive and in-depth corporate experience and strategic thinking), which are essential and/or valuable for decision-making. Further information on our Directors is found in the section of the Annual Report entitled "Board of Directors" at pages 10 to 14.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

(As at 17 March 2025)

# (2) Provision 2.5

The non-executive and/or independent Directors communicate at Board Committee meetings and as and, when necessary, without the presence of Management and are also provided with the opportunity annually to meet without Management's presence. They provide feedback to the Management of their views including on the Group's operations and processes, from time to time. The independent Directors of the Company may communicate periodically without the presence of the other Directors as and when they see the need for issues to be discussed separately from the entire Board.

# CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

Principle 3: There is a clear division of responsibilities between the leadership of the Board and Management, and no one individual has unfettered powers of decision-making.

# (1) Provisions 3.1 and 3.2

Provision 3.1 of the Code states that "The Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") are separate persons to ensure an appropriate balance of power, increased accountability, and greater capacity of the Board for independent decision making". The Chairman and the Joint Group Managing Directors of the Company are separate persons. The Board believes that the Company has not varied from Provision 3.1. Mr Lam Sing Chung is the non-executive Chairman of the Board. Mr Lam Sing Chung and one of the Joint Group Managing Directors, Mr Lin Kejian, are immediate family members. The Board had considered that whilst Mr Lam Sing Chung and Mr Lin Kejian are immediate family members, the Vice-Chairman, Mr Philip Yeo Liat Kok, as well as Joint Group Managing Director, Mr Michael Darren Hewat, are not relatives of either of them. Mr Lin Kejian focuses on the strategic direction of the Group. Whilst Mr Hewat also focuses on the Group's strategic direction, oversight of the Group's affairs is handled by him. In addition, Mr Lam Sing Chung and Mr Lin Kejian, together, do not comprise a majority of the Board. On this basis, no single Director of the Company has unfettered powers to make decisions on behalf of the Board. The Nominating Committee and the Board consider that, in the circumstances, there is sufficient balance of power and accountability, and the capacity of the Board for independent decision making is not prejudiced, and that the Company's practice is consistent with the intent of Principle 3 of the Code.

# (2) Provision 3.3

Provision 3.3 of the Code provides that "The Board has a lead independent director to provide leadership in situations where the Chairman is conflicted, and especially when the Chairman is not independent. The lead independent director is available to shareholders where they have concerns and for which contact through the normal channels of communication with the Chairman or Management are inappropriate or inadequate". Our Chairman, Mr Lam Sing Chung, is not an independent Director. In February 2023, the Company announced the appointment of Mr Philip Yeo Liat Kok as Vice-Chairman of the Board. He is an independent Director. With the appointment of an independent Vice-Chairman, the Board considered that it was no longer necessary to have a lead independent director. Whilst we may have varied from Provision 3.3, our Vice-Chairman, who is an independent Director, would be an alternative channel of communication for shareholders. Further, our Chairman and his son, Mr Lin Kejian, do not comprise a majority of the Board. On this basis, no single Director of the Company has unfettered powers to make decisions on behalf of the Board. The Nominating Committee and the Board consider that in the circumstances, the Company's practice is consistent with the intent of Principle 3 of the Code.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

(As at 17 March 2025)

# BOARD MEMBERSHIP

Principle 4: The Board has a formal and transparent process for the appointment and re-appointment of directors, taking into account the need for progressive renewal of the Board.

(1) Provisions 4.1 and 4.2

In FY2024, the Nominating Committee consisted of Ms Dawn Pamela Lum (chairman), Mr Lam Sing Chung and Mr Philip Yeo Liat Kok, the independent Vice-Chairman of the Board. The majority of the Nominating Committee, including the chairman, are independent Directors.

Under its written terms of reference, the Nominating Committee is empowered, inter alia, to review and make recommendations to the Board on the following matters:

(a) setting up and implementation of procedures to facilitate a formal and transparent process for the appointment of new directors;  
(b) the suitability of the directors due for re-election and re-nomination each year;  
(c) the independence of each director;  
(d) the training needs of the Board members; and  
(e) the process and criteria for the evaluation of the performance and effectiveness of the Board as a whole, and ascertain whether any aspects of the Board's oversight can be strengthened and improved.

In addition, the Nominating Committee is responsible for making recommendations to the Board on relevant matters relating to, amongst others, the review of succession plans for Directors and key management personnel, the process and criteria for evaluation of the performance of the Board, its Board Committees and Directors, and Board diversity (as further elaborated under Principle 2 "Provisions 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4").

(2) Provision 4.3

As part of the selection process for the appointment of new directors, the Nominating Committee reviews the composition of the Board, taking into account, amongst others, the need to refresh Board membership progressively, the requirement under the Listing Manual and the Code for independent directors, whether the candidate is of the right fit taking into consideration the needs and future plans of the Group's businesses and the Board, as the case may be, and whether the candidate meets or is expected to meet the relevant needs and vision of the Board and Company at the material time. With respect to the need for Board diversity in matters such as skillsets, experience and expertise, gender and age so as to enhance the Board's effectiveness, please refer to the write-up above under Principle 2 "Provisions 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4". The Nominating Committee typically identifies and searches for candidates through various contacts and recommendations (including proposals and recommendations of substantial shareholders and Board members). The Nominating Committee's recommendation is subject to the Board's approval.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

(As at 17 March 2025)

In deciding the Directors who are to stand for re-election, the Nominating Committee evaluates the contribution and performance of each Director to the effectiveness of the Board and also considers the need for progressive renewal of the Board. The review parameters for evaluating each Director include attendance, preparedness, candour and participation at Board/Committee meetings, professional skills, knowledge and experience relevant to management or operation of the business, entrepreneurial business skills and regional investment experience.

# (3) Provision 4.4

The independence of each Director is reviewed annually by the Nominating Committee and, as and when circumstances require, whether there is a change to the independent status previously accorded to the relevant Directors. For the Nominating Committee's review on the independence of Directors in FY2024, please refer to the section dealing with Principle 2 "Provisions 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4" on page 94 of this report.

# (4) Provision 4.5

The Nominating Committee is assisted by the Legal Department of the Company in providing new Directors with information on their duties and obligations as directors (please refer to the section dealing with Principle 1 "Provision 1.2" of this report). The Nominating Committee evaluates the performance of the Directors annually, as described under Principle 5 "Provisions 5.1 and 5.2".

The Directors' board representations (if any) on other listed companies and other principal commitments are set out on pages 10 to 14 and pages 200 to 205 of the Annual Report. The Board takes the view that such other listed company board representations have not compromised any of the relevant Directors' ability to carry out and discharge his/her duties adequately. The number of directorships in other listed companies held by each of the Directors (if any) does not give rise to material concern and the Board considers the experience that our Directors may have in other listed companies to be an asset.

# BOARD PERFORMANCE

Principle 5: The Board undertakes a formal annual assessment of its effectiveness as a whole, and that of each of its board committees and individual directors.

# Provisions 5.1 and 5.2

The Nominating Committee recommends to the Board the objective performance criteria and process for the evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board as a whole and of each Board Committee separately as well as the contribution of the Chairman of the Board and each individual Director.

The Nominating Committee believes that in evaluating the Board's effectiveness, both quantitative and qualitative criteria of a long-term perspective are to be taken into account. Criteria considered by the Nominating Committee include the pursuit of strategy of long-term sustainable growth and value creation to enhance shareholder value; the financial performance of the Group including by reference to revenue growth, EBITDA and profitability; financial position and returns to shareholders; any business opportunities introduced by the Board; and readiness of the Board to redefine and modify corporate strategies in a changing business environment and its ability to lend support to the Management in steering the Group towards the objectives set.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

(As at 17 March 2025)

The Nominating Committee has established a formal evaluation process for assessing the Board as a whole, the Board Committees and individual Directors. For FY2024, no external facilitator was engaged. Each Director was requested to complete an evaluation form to assess the effectiveness of the Board in key areas including board composition, procedures, strategy, performance and training. The Nominating Committee also undertook an evaluation of the Board Committees based on, amongst others, certain assessment criteria recommended by the Singapore Institute of Directors. Information on the contributions and performance of individual Directors including on Board Committees was collated, incorporating any comments of the Directors by way of self-assessment, and reviewed by the Nominating Committee. In its evaluation of individual Directors, the Nominating Committee considered, amongst others, the specific criteria set out under Principle 4 "Provision 4.3" and under Principle 7 "Provisions 7.1 and 7.3". The results of the evaluation exercise were reviewed by the Nominating Committee, and reported to the Board with any relevant recommendations where applicable. When deliberating on the performance of a particular Director who is also a member of the Nominating Committee, that member abstains from the decision-making.

# REMUNERATION MATTERS

# Procedures for Developing Remuneration Policies/Level and Mix of Remuneration/Disclosure on Remuneration

Principle 6: The Board has a formal and transparent procedure for developing policies on director and executive remuneration, and for fixing the remuneration packages of individual directors and key management personnel. No director is involved in deciding his or her own remuneration.

Principle 7: The level and structure of remuneration of the Board and key management personnel are appropriate and proportionate to the sustained performance and value creation of the company, taking into account the strategic objectives of the company.

Principle 8: The company is transparent on its remuneration policies, level and mix of remuneration, the procedure for setting remuneration, and the relationships between remuneration, performance and value creation.

(1) Provisions 6.1 to 6.4

In FY2024, the Remuneration Committee consisted of Ms Dawn Pamela Lum (chairman), Mr Lam Sing Chung and Mr Philip Yeo Liat Kok. All of them are non-executive Directors and the majority, including the chairman, are independent Directors.

Under its written terms of reference, the Remuneration Committee, amongst others, shall assist the Board in the review of the framework for remuneration of the Board and key management personnel, set up procedures to facilitate a process by which the remuneration of executive Directors is determined and adopt the criteria by which their performance and contribution is to be assessed in an objective and fair manner. Remuneration includes salary, discretionary bonuses and other benefits such as Central Provident Fund ("CPF") contributions. The Remuneration Committee shall also review service contracts to be entered into between the Company and an executive Director or other key management personnel of the Company, including the provisions relating to remuneration, the duration of appointment and early termination, to ascertain that such service contracts do not provide for excessively long periods of employment or onerous removal clauses. No remuneration consultant was engaged by the Company in FY2024.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

(As at 17 March 2025)

The Remuneration Committee reviews and makes recommendations to the Board on the remuneration packages of the Directors and key management personnel (who are not also Directors). Any Director who has an interest in the matter in question is required to abstain from participating in the decision-making. In FY2024, Ms Ong Wui Leng retired and ceased to be a member of the Board and an executive Director with effect from 20 February 2024. The Board determined that she be paid an amount of approximately S$208,575 for her past services, taking into account 3.5 months' remuneration for FY2024. This is in line with the Company's objective of facilitating smooth succession, rewarding and motivating other Group executives and promoting a strong sense of commitment by such executives to the Group with a view to their retention.

# (2) Provisions 7.1 and 7.3

The Remuneration Committee's review and recommendations to the Board on the remuneration packages of the executive Directors and key management personnel (who are not also Directors) are undertaken with the objective of ensuring that their remuneration is competitive and sufficient to attract, retain and motivate persons of the required calibre, skills and integrity to provide good stewardship and manage the Company and oversee the Group successfully, as well as motivate competent, committed and loyal key executives. For FY2024, the Remuneration Committee determined that the factors to be taken into account for this purpose include the individual performance and contribution of the employee to the Group, performance of the Group and prevailing market remuneration where applicable. With respect to individual performance and contribution, considerations include where applicable, technical knowledge, experience, understanding of Group's strategic objectives (including expanding its distribution business), steering the Group towards meeting such objectives, leadership and other skillsets, risk management, motivating and guiding management teams in the execution of projects, the extent to which the individual is accountable and responsible for other employees and whether the executive is a team player. Performance of the Group is not based on a single year in isolation, but over a period of time, to encourage focus on long-term sustainable growth and value creation, over short-termism. Consideration is also given to the scale of the Group's operations (including Gardenia Bakeries (KL) Sdn Bhd, the Group's Malaysian joint venture), which span several countries and generated revenue of approximately S$985 million in FY2024.

For FY2024, a total of four executives (who are not Directors) were considered by the Company to be key management personnel within the definition of the Code (ie, the chief executive officer and other persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the company).

The remuneration of the Company's executive Directors and key management personnel (who are not also Directors) generally comprises two components. One component is fixed in the form of a base salary. The other component is variable in the form of discretionary bonus (determined taking into consideration the factors set out above). In addition, the executive Directors and certain key management personnel receive benefits such as car benefits. The Company does not have any employees' share incentive plan to avoid short-termism. None of the executive Directors' and key management personnel's remuneration is tied solely and specifically to the profitability of the Company or the Group. Executive Directors and the key management personnel (who are not also Directors) receive remuneration as employees of the Company and do not receive directors' fees or other remuneration from the Company or its subsidiaries.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

(As at 17 March 2025)

The long-term interests of the Company and its risk policies are therefore taken into account in structuring and determining remuneration. Board endorsement is sought for the remuneration packages of the executive Directors and the key management personnel (who are not Directors).

The Company did not have contractual provisions to reclaim incentive components of remuneration from FY2024 executive Directors and key management personnel (who are not also Directors) in exceptional cases of mis-statement of financial results or of misconduct resulting in financial loss to the Company. The executive Directors owe fiduciary, statutory as well as contractual duties to the Company and the Company considered that it may avail itself of remedies against the executive Directors in the event of breach of their relevant duties. Further, none of the executive Directors' and other key management personnel's remuneration is tied solely and specifically to the profitability of the Company or the Group, as explained above.

# (3) Provision 7.2

For Directors' fees for FY2024, non-executive Directors are to be paid a basic fee for Board membership and an additional fee for serving on Committees as per the fee structure set out below:

<table><tr><td>Board Membership (base fee)</td><td>S$40,000</td></tr><tr><td>Board Chairman</td><td>Nil as our Chairman has elected not to receive fees</td></tr><tr><td>Audit &amp; Risk Committee</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Chairman</td><td>S$30,000</td></tr><tr><td>Other members</td><td>S$20,000</td></tr><tr><td>Nominating/Remuneration Committee</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Chairman</td><td>S$20,000</td></tr><tr><td>Other members</td><td>S$15,000</td></tr></table>

In the interest of maintaining the objectivity and independence of the non-executive Directors, the Company has applied a cash-based fixed fee generally at a rate considered comparable with those that are adopted by a majority of other SGX-ST listed companies with similar market capitalisation.

Directors' fees are subject to approval by the shareholders of the Company as a lump sum at each AGM of the Company and accordingly, shareholders may vote on the total FY2024 remuneration of non-executive Directors at the AGM to be held on 25 April 2025. The total Directors' fees, subject to shareholders' approval, payable for FY2024, as well as the breakdown payable to each non-executive Director, is set out in the sub-section below under "Provisions 8.1 and 8.3".

# (4) Provisions 8.1 and 8.3

The Corporate Governance Code (Provision 8.1) provides, inter alia, that the amount and breakdown of remuneration of individual directors and the chief executive officer paid by the company and its subsidiaries are to be disclosed. In view of the SGX-ST listing rules, such disclosure is mandatory.

Provision 8.1 of the Code also provides that the remuneration of the top five key management personnel at least (who are not directors, and who are to be named) are to be disclosed in bands no wider than S\(250,000, on a “comply or explain” basis. As stated above, for FY2024, the Company had only four executives (who are not Directors) considered to be key management personnel within the definition of the Code.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

(As at 17 March 2025)

Please refer to the tabulation below for information on the remuneration in respect of FY2024, of the Company’s executive Directors and key management personnel (who are not Directors):

(1) Includes, where applicable, employer's CPF contribution, car benefits, accommodation, air passage benefits and leave encashment.  
(2) Ceased employment with effect from 20 February 2024.  
(3) Includes executive(s) who became key management personnel during FY2024.  
(4) Figures are rounded to the nearest thousand.

In considering the disclosure of remuneration of the Company's key management personnel (who are not also Directors) in the manner set out in Provision 8.1 of the Code, the Remuneration Committee considered, amongst others, the importance of maintaining the cohesion, spirit of teamwork and morale prevailing among senior management executives of the Group, the competitive industry conditions and the sensitive and confidential nature of employees' remuneration. The Group's competitors include groups that are unlisted and who do not publish details of the remuneration of its key executives.

The Company is of the view that its corporate governance practice for FY2024 in relation to remuneration disclosure is consistent with the intent of Principle 8. Although the Company has varied from Provision 8.1 to the extent that the names and breakdown of remuneration of its key management personnel (who are not Directors) are not disclosed, the Company has in respect of its four key management personnel (who are not Directors) disclosed their FY2024 remuneration in band(s) of S\(250,000 and sufficient information to ascertain their aggregate remuneration. The Company has also provided information on its remuneration policy including criteria for assessment of performance and the relationship between remuneration, performance and value creation (see information under Principle 7 "Provisions 7.1 and 7.3"). The Company therefore believes that, taken as a whole, the disclosures provided are meaningful and sufficiently transparent in giving an understanding of the remuneration of its key management personnel including the executive Directors.

# ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT

# Risk management and Internal Controls

Principle 9: The Board is responsible for the governance of risk and ensures that Management maintains a sound system of risk management and internal controls, to safeguard the interests of the company and its shareholders.

Provisions 9.1 and 9.2

The Board is overall responsible for the governance of risk. To assist the Board in carrying out its responsibility of overseeing the Company's risk management framework and policies, the Audit & Risk Committee, with the assistance of internal and external auditors and Management, assumes the responsibility of the risk management function. Management reviews regularly the Group's business and operational activities to identify areas of significant risks as well as appropriate measures to control and mitigate these risks. Management reviews significant policies and procedures and highlights significant matters to the Audit & Risk Committee.

The Board has determined the nature and extent of the significant risks that the Company is willing to take to achieve its strategic objectives and value creation. It has determined that the following approval thresholds shall apply, and shall be observed by Management:

(a) Major transactions (as defined in the Listing Manual) require Board approval. Generally, under the Listing Manual, major transactions are acquisitions or disposals of assets or the provision of financial assistance where the  $20\%$  threshold, based on the prescribed benchmarks, are exceeded. Examples are where the net profit attributable to the relevant asset exceeds  $20\%$  of the Group's net profit and where the aggregate value of the consideration for the asset exceeds  $20\%$  of the market capitalization of the Company;  
(b) (i) Interested person transactions of value below  $3\%$  of the latest audited consolidated NTA of the Group require the approval of the Audit & Risk Committee; and  
(ii) Interested person transactions of value equal to or more than  $3\%$  of the latest audited consolidated NTA of the Group require Audit & Risk Committee and Board approval;  
(c) Investments or divestments with a value more than  $10\%$  of the market capitalization of the Company require Board approval; and  
(d) Any matter which the Management considers to be material for deliberation by the Board.

For each of (a) to (d) above, shareholders' approval shall also be sought where required by law or the Listing Manual.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

(As at 17 March 2025)

The Group's financial performance and operations are influenced by a wide range of risk factors and some of these risks are not within the Group's control. There may also be risks that are either presently unknown or not currently assessed as significant, which may later prove to be material. The Group aims to mitigate these risks through appropriate risk management strategies and internal controls and has updated its Group Enterprise Risk Management Policy and performed its annual Group Risk Assessment based on our Enterprise Risk Management framework. The key categories of risks faced by the Group's continuing operations and the mitigation strategies in place, which are not listed in the order of significance, as at 31 December 2024 are summarised as follows:

<table><tr><td>Risk</td><td>Risk Description</td><td>Key Mitigation Strategies</td></tr><tr><td>Foreign Exchange</td><td>• Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates</td><td>• The Group accepts that operating across multiple geographical locations exposes itself to foreign exchange risks relating to both foreign currency transactions and translation of its financial results. It considers any additional risk and cost associated with introducing any hedging strategy. Typical mitigation strategies in place across the Group include borrowings in local overseas markets.</td></tr><tr><td>Climate Change</td><td>• Longer-term shifts in climate patterns, prolonged adverse weather conditions</td><td>• Climate change and unforeseen weather events are increasing, thereby creating future uncertainty and heightening risk across industries. The specific consequences of climate events and their mitigation are dealt with individually within the Group ERM framework and disclosed through the Group&#x27;s reporting of its Sustainability Report on pages 49 to 58 of this Annual Report.</td></tr><tr><td>Commodity</td><td>• Input costs linked to commodities such as wheat, oil and gas
• Commodity price volatility impact long-term cost structure
• Inflationary or increasing price trends</td><td>• The Group mitigates this exposure through its core business in branded retail consumer staple products. Branding allows pricing flexibility for the Group to manage its revenue against changing input costs.</td></tr><tr><td>Supply Chain</td><td>• Increasing cost, disruption or unavailability of resources
• Lack of adequate capacity in key transportation and logistics infrastructure due to supply chain interruptions</td><td>• Business units are encouraged to have various transport and logistics options available to mitigate any interruption of a single channel.
• Building of raw material inventory ahead of anticipated interruptions is a key strategy.
• Business units are encouraged to incorporate logistics into their business continuity plans (&quot;BCPs&quot;).</td></tr></table>

Further, in performing its function, the Audit & Risk Committee met with internal and external auditors, reviewed the audit plans of both internal and external auditors and the assistance given by Management to the auditors, to assess sufficiency of coverage in terms of the scope of audit. Audit findings and recommendations in respect of FY2024 were presented to the Audit & Risk Committee for discussion. The following key audit matter in respect of FY2024 was presented by the external auditor, Ernst & Young LLP ("E&Y"), to the Audit & Risk Committee for consideration and action:

<table><tr><td>Key audit matter</td><td>How Audit &amp; Risk Committee reviewed this matter and what decision was made</td></tr><tr><td>Impairment of investment in joint venture</td><td>• Audit &amp; Risk Committee considered and is satisfied with the valuation methodology and reasonableness of key assumptions used to estimate the recoverable amount of the investment in joint venture.
• The assessment of the recoverable amount of the investment in joint venture was a key area of focus for E&amp;Y. This item was included as a key audit matter in its audit report for FY2024. Please refer to page 121 of this Annual Report.</td></tr></table>

The review of the Group's internal controls and risk management systems is a continuing process. The internal controls (including in respect of the financial, operational, compliance and information technology controls) and risk management systems as adopted by the Group are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve key business objectives. Part of the Group's business is located in regional countries which are challenging with different control environments to operate in and where laws, practices and cultures differ from those in Singapore. The internal controls and risk management systems are designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance as to material financial, operational, compliance and information technology risks. No such system can provide absolute assurance against the occurrence of material errors and other situations not currently within the contemplation or beyond the control of the Board and/or Management including matters arising from human and/or system errors, poor judgement in decision making, corruption, fraud or other irregularities. Management continues to review and look at areas of improvement.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

(As at 17 March 2025)

Based on the internal controls and risk management systems established and maintained by the Group, the work performed by the internal and external auditors and consultant(s), reviews performed by Management and relevant Board Committees, the assurances of the senior management of the various business units and the assurances of the personnel referred to below and where applicable having regard to the matters above, the Board is of the opinion that in respect of FY2024:

(a) the financial records of the Group have been properly maintained and the financial statements give a true and fair view of the Group's operations and financials; and  
(b) the Group's internal controls (including financial, operational, compliance and information technology controls) and risk management systems were adequate and effective as at 31 December 2024 to address the financial, operational, compliance and information technology risks which the Group considers relevant and material to its current business operations.

The Board had received assurances from the Joint Group Managing Directors, Chief Financial Officer and Group Financial Controller of the Company confirming the matters in (a) above and from the Joint Group Managing Directors, Chief Financial Officer, Group Financial Controller, the Head of Internal Audit and relevant executive(s) of the Company confirming the matters in (b) above. The Audit & Risk Committee concurs with the Board's opinion.

# AUDIT COMMITTEE

Principle 10: The Board has an Audit Committee ("AC") which discharges its duties objectively.

(1) Provisions 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3

In FY2024, the Audit & Risk Committee consisted of four non-executive independent Directors, namely Mr Norman Ip (chairman), Ms Dawn Pamela Lum, Mr Chee Teck Kwong Patrick and Dr Lian Hwee Peng Rebecca.

At least two members, including the Audit & Risk Committee chairman, have recent and relevant accounting or related financial management expertise or experience. The Company's Audit & Risk Committee chairman, Mr Norman Ip, is a Chartered Accountant by training and has experience as director, chief executive officer and senior management in listed entities, including on audit and/or risk committees.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

(As at 17 March 2025)

The Audit & Risk Committee is empowered by its terms of reference to investigate any matter within its terms of reference. It is also to be given full access to and the co-operation of the Management, including the internal auditors, and has full discretion to invite the external auditors, any Director and executive officer to attend its meetings.

# (2) Provisions 10.4 and 10.5

The Group employs a qualified and experienced internal audit manager as at 31 December 2024, who oversees the internal audit programme for the Group with the assistance of an external professional audit firm which is contracted to perform the relevant field work. The Head of Internal Audit is a member of the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants (ISCA), the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA) and the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners. The primary reporting line of the Head of Internal Audit is to the Audit & Risk Committee, with administrative reporting to the Joint Group Managing Directors. The Audit & Risk Committee reviews and approves the annual internal audit plan proposed by the Head of Internal Audit. The internal auditors perform their work in accordance with the International Professional Practices Framework set by the IIA and report independently their findings and recommendations to the Audit & Risk Committee. The Audit & Risk Committee's terms of reference provide for it to review and approve the appointment, termination and remuneration of the Head of Internal Audit. The internal audit function has unfettered access to all the Company's documents, records, properties and personnel, including the Audit & Risk Committee, and has appropriate standing within the Company. Taking into account the foregoing matters and the work performed by the internal auditors, the Audit & Risk Committee is of the view that the internal audit function is independent, effective and adequately resourced.

The Company appoints E&Y which is a firm registered with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority to conduct audit on its financial statements. The Company also engages E&Y for audit of its Singapore-incorporated subsidiaries and member firms of E&Y for its significant foreign incorporated subsidiaries and associated company/joint venture. The Company is in compliance with Rules 712 and 715 of the SGX-ST Listing Manual in relation to the appointment of its audit firms for the Group.

Prior to the annual re-appointment of the external auditor, its independence is reviewed by the Audit & Risk Committee. E&Y has confirmed to the Committee that it is independent within the meaning of the Singapore Accountants (Public Accountants) Rules and the requirements of the Companies Act. E&Y has informed the Committee that it has evaluated its independence and, inter alia, that it has policies and procedures in place to safeguard its independence. The fees for audit and non-audit services in FY2024 amounted to approximately S$886,000 and S$174,000, respectively. E&Y had also confirmed to the Audit & Risk Committee that the non-audit services provided during FY2024 have not impaired its independence. The amount of non-audit fees received by E&Y from the Company and its controlled entities do not exceed 50% of the total annual audit fees received by E&Y from the Company and its controlled entities. E&Y has further confirmed that it is not aware of any relationships between E&Y and the Company that, in its professional judgement, may reasonably be thought to bear on its independence. Taking into account the foregoing, the Audit & Risk Committee is of the opinion that the non-audit fees paid to the auditors for FY2024 would not compromise the independence of E&Y and the Audit & Risk Committee recommended to the Board the re-appointment of the external auditor for FY2025 (subject to shareholders' approval).

The Audit & Risk Committee meets with the Head of Internal Audit and the external auditor, without the presence of Management, at least annually.

# SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS AND ENGAGEMENT

# Shareholder Rights and Conduct of General Meetings

Principle 11: The company treats all shareholders fairly and equitably in order to enable them to exercise shareholders' rights and have the opportunity to communicate their views on matters affecting the company. The company gives shareholders a balanced and understandable assessment of its performance, position and prospects.

(1) Provisions 11.1 and 11.2

The Company is committed to treating its shareholders fairly and equitably. It believes in timely corporate disclosure as prescribed in Appendix 7.1 (Corporate Disclosure Policy) of the Listing Manual. Material information with respect to the Group is released to shareholders via SGXNET and not to a selected group only, pursuant and subject to the listing rules. Emphasis has been placed on further enhancing the level and quality of disclosures in the Company's announcements, including results announcements, and annual report, including giving a balanced and understandable assessment of the Group's performance and prospects (for example, competitive landscape and significant trends).

Communication is made principally through:

annual reports to shareholders issued before the AGM. The annual report, which contains the notice of annual general meeting, includes key relevant information about the Company and the Group including a review of the Group's major operations and their general outlook, disclosures required by the Companies Act, Listing Manual and the Accounting Standards;  
financial announcements on the financial performance of the Group for the period in question;  
circulars for extraordinary general meetings where applicable ("EGM");  
announcements and disclosures to the SGX-ST via SGXNET; and  
- the Company's website at www.qaf.com.sg at which our shareholders can access information on the Group.

The full annual report of the Company is made available to shareholders.

In line with the Company's sustainability efforts and as permitted by the Companies Act and the listing rules, the Company makes annual reports and circulars of the Company available to shareholders by way of electronic communications via posting these documents on the Company's website. Shareholders may however request for a printed copy of such documents by submitting a request form to the Company's share registrar. Further, printed copies of the notice of AGM/EGM, proxy form and such request forms will be sent to shareholders. The notice of AGM/EGM is also advertised in a local newspaper as required by the Company's Constitution.

Shareholders are entitled to vote at general meetings in person or by proxy in accordance with the Company's Constitution or applicable law. Resolutions are put forth with a view to each substantially separate issue unless the issues are interdependent and linked so as to form one significant proposal. Where the resolutions are "bundled" (if any), the Company will explain the reasons and material implications in the notice of meeting pursuant to the relevant requirements. Each item of special business included in the notice of the meeting is accompanied by a statement regarding the effect of the proposed resolution in respect of such business. At each general meeting, the procedure for voting is explained to shareholders by the scrutinier and/or the polling agent appointed by the Company.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

(As at 17 March 2025)

The Company implements electronic poll voting for resolutions tabled at an AGM and/or EGM. This entails shareholders being invited to vote on each of the resolutions by poll, using an electronic voting system (instead of voting by show of hands), thereby allowing all shareholders present or represented at the meeting to vote on a one share, one vote basis. Votes cast for, or against, each resolution are made known to shareholders at the meeting. The total number and percentage of votes cast for or against the resolutions are also announced after the meetings via SGXNET pursuant and subject to requirements of the listing rules.

# (2) Provision 11.3

All members of the Board as at that date attended the AGM of the Company in FY2024. The external auditors were also present to address shareholders' queries, if any, about the conduct of audit and the preparation and content of the auditors' report.

# (3) Provision 11.4

Under the Constitution, a shareholder may appoint up to two proxies to attend and vote on his/her behalf at the meeting through proxy forms deposited with the Company at least 72 hours before the meeting. A member who is a "relevant intermediary" may appoint more than two proxies each at the AGM. "Relevant intermediary" includes certain corporations holding licenses for the provision of custodial services for securities and the CPF Board in respect of purchases of shares on behalf of CPF investors.

The Company's Constitution permits voting in absentia by appointment of proxy.

# (4) Provision 11.5

The Company Secretary prepares minutes of general meetings that include substantive and relevant comments or queries from shareholders relating to the agenda of the meetings, and responses from the Board and Management. In FY2024, the Company published minutes of general meetings of shareholders on its corporate website as required by the listing rules. The Company will continue to publish minutes of general meetings of shareholders on its corporate website where required by the prevailing listing rules. Consistent with the intent of Principle 11, shareholders have a right to attend general meetings either in person or by proxy, and, subject to applicable laws, they may exercise their right to speak or raise relevant questions, and vote, and have the opportunity to communicate their views on various matters affecting the Company. Given prevailing listing rules, the Company will either publish its replies to substantial and relevant written questions raised by shareholders prior to an AGM or respond to such questions at the relevant AGM. Further, shareholders, including those who did not attend the relevant general meeting, have a statutory right to be furnished copies of minutes of general meetings in accordance with Section 189 of the Companies Act. The Company is therefore of the view that, consistent with the intent of Principle 11, as between themselves, shareholders are treated fairly and equitably by the Company.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

(As at 17 March 2025)

# (5) Provision 11.6

The Company does not have a formal policy on the payment of dividends (and to that extent its practice varies from Provision 11.6 of the Code which states that a "company has a dividend policy"). However, consistent with Provision 11.6, the Company has communicated to shareholders that this is to maintain flexibility to support the growth of the Group. The Company is of the view that a fixed dividend policy can hinder a long-term sustainable growth strategy. Although there is no formal dividend policy, the Board considers the sustainability of dividends to be paid based on the Group's balance sheet, cash generating capability and performance over several years, after setting aside appropriate capital expenditure needed for the businesses. The Company aims to pay consistent and steady dividends having regard, amongst others, to the long-term nature of the Group's business, the financial strength of the Group's balance sheet and the Company's strategy of value creation to enhance shareholder value. In line with the strategy of value creation to enhance shareholder value, balanced by the Company's prudent capital management policy, the Board has decided to recommend a final dividend of S $0.04 per share for FY2024. Together with the interim S$ 0.01 dividend paid in 2024, the total dividend for FY2024 would amount to S$0.05 per share (total of approximately S$28.8 million). Dividends recommended or declared for payment are announced on SGXNET. The Company pays dividends in a timely manner after they have been declared or approved at the AGM, as the case may be. If the QAF Limited Scrip Dividend Scheme is applied to any dividend, the payment date will be in compliance with the SGX-ST Listing Rules (that is, the payment date will be not more than 35 market days after the relevant record date). The Company is accordingly of the view that it gives its shareholders a balanced and understandable assessment of its position on a dividend policy, as well as on the Company's performance, financial position and prospects through its disclosures in its results and other announcements and its annual report, and its practice is consistent with the intent of Principle 11.

# ENGAGEMENT WITH SHAREHOLDERS

Principle 12: The company communicates regularly with its shareholders and facilitates the participation of shareholders during general meetings and other dialogues to allow shareholders to communicate their views on various matters affecting the company.

# (1) Provision 12.1

Shareholder meetings are the principal forum for dialogue and interaction with shareholders including soliciting and understanding their views. Subject to applicable laws and/or rules in relation to these meetings, shareholders are given the opportunity to air their views and ask Directors and/or Management relevant questions regarding the Company and the Group.

The Company has also designated certain personnel to attend to communications with shareholders and, as a matter of policy, Management engages with shareholders from time to time on relevant matters including where individual shareholders reach out to provide feedback or seek clarification on matters relating to the Group's business. Shareholders may provide feedback through the Company's designated email address, info@qaf.com.sg, provided in the Company's corporate website. Where arising from such queries any material information is proposed to be disclosed, the Company releases the information on SGXNET pursuant to the listing rules, so that such information is available to all shareholders.

# CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT

(As at 17 March 2025)

# (2) Provisions 12.2 and 12.3

The Company has an investor policy which encourages shareholders to regularly communicate with it including through the Company's designated email address, info@qaf.com.sg, provided in the Company's corporate website. The Company's objective is to encourage constructive comments and exchange of views so that it may take into account or address such comments and concerns when preparing its results announcements and annual report. In addition, where necessary, the Company may issue announcement(s) in response to comments and concerns raised, so that the information is available to all shareholders.

# MANAGING STAKEHOLDERS RELATIONSHIPS

# Engagement with Stakeholders

Principle 13: The Board adopts an inclusive approach by considering and balancing the needs and interests of material stakeholders, as part of its overall responsibility to ensure that the best interests of the company are served.

# (1) Provision 13.1

The Company has arrangements in place to identify and engage with its material stakeholder groups and to manage its relationships with such groups. This is done by the different business units on an on-going basis (for example, with their suppliers, customers and the local community in which they operate) as such matters have to be tailored to their differing needs, and on an annual basis in conjunction with the Company's preparations for sustainability reporting.

# (2) Provision 13.2

The Company's Sustainability Report at pages 29 to 90 discloses its strategy and key areas of focus in relation to the management of stakeholder relationships during FY2024.

# (3) Provision 13.3

The Company maintains a current corporate website (www.qaf.com.sg) to communicate and engage with its stakeholders.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

For the year ended 31 December 2024

Independent auditor's report to the members of QAF Limited

Report on the audit of the financial statements

# Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of QAF Limited (the "Company") and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Group"), which comprise the statements of financial position of the Group and the Company as at 31 December 2024, the consolidated statement of changes in equity, the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income and consolidated statement of cash flows of the Group for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including material accounting policy information.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Group and the statement of financial position of the Company are properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1967 of Singapore (the "Act") and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (SFRS(I)) so as to give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group and the financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2024 and of the consolidated financial performance, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group for the year ended on that date.

# Basis for opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing (SSAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities (ACRA Code) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Singapore, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ACRA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

# Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

We have fulfilled our responsibilities described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying financial statements.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

For the year ended 31 December 2024

Independent auditor's report to the members of QAF Limited (cont'd)

Key audit matters (cont'd)

Impairment of investment in joint venture

The Group has an investment in joint venture which amounted to  $48.2 million as of 31 December 2024. Note 20 to the financial statements provides information on the contractual agreement with the partner of the joint venture. During the year, the Group recognised an impairment loss of$ 1.2 million.

Management assessed that there were indicators of impairment at the end of the reporting period and has accordingly, assessed the recoverable amount of the investment in joint venture. The recoverable amount of the investment in joint venture was determined based on value-in-use calculations using cash flow projections approved by management. This requires management to exercise judgement in making the impairment assessment and make a number of assumptions in the underlying cash flow projections which are subject to significant estimation uncertainty. As such, we determined this to be a key audit matter.

# How our audit addressed the key audit matter

As part of our audit procedures, we reviewed management's identification of indicators of impairment in the joint venture. We assessed the valuation methodology and the reasonableness of key assumptions used to estimate the recoverable amount of the investment in joint venture. The key assumptions include the forecast revenue growth rates and discount rate at the end of the term of contractual agreement with the partner of the joint venture. We considered the robustness of management's budgeting process by comparing the actual financial performance against previously forecasted results and evaluated the forecast revenue growth rates by comparison to recent and actual performance and available external market data. We involved our internal valuation specialists to independently develop expectations of the discount rate for reasonableness. We reviewed management's sensitivity analysis in relation to how reasonable changes in the key assumptions could impact the estimation of recoverable amount.

We also reviewed the adequacy of disclosures set out in Note 20 to the financial statements.

# Other information

Management is responsible for other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report but does not include the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

For the year ended 31 December 2024

Independent auditor's report to the members of QAF Limited (cont'd)

Responsibilities of management and directors for the financial statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the provisions of the Act and SFRS(I), and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

The directors' responsibilities include overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.

# Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.  
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.  
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.  
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

For the year ended 31 December 2024

Independent auditor's report to the members of QAF Limited (cont'd)

Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements (cont'd)

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.  
- Plan and perform the group audit to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business units within the Group as a basis for forming express an opinion on the group financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and review of the audit work performed for purposes of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# Report on other legal and regulatory requirements

In our opinion, the accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the Company and by those subsidiary corporations incorporated in Singapore of which we are the auditors have been properly kept in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor's report is Philip Ng Weng Kwai.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For the financial year ended 31 December 2024

The principal activities of the Company are those of an investment holding and management company. The principal activities of the Group consist of the manufacture and distribution of bread, bakery and confectionery products; provision for warehousing logistics for food items; trading and distribution of food and beverages.

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION

# 2.1 Basis of preparation

The consolidated financial statements of the Group and the statement of financial position of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (SFRS(I)).

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except as disclosed in the material accounting policy information below.

The consolidated financial statements are presented in Singapore dollars (SGD or $) and all values in the tables are rounded to the nearest thousand ($’000) as indicated.

# 2.2 Changes in accounting policies

The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except in the current financial year, the Group has adopted all the new and amended standards which are effective for annual financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024. The adoption of these standards did not have any material effect on the financial performance or position of the Group.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For the financial year ended 31 December 2024

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT'D)

# 2.3 Standards issued but not yet effective

The Group has not adopted the following standards and interpretations that have been issued but not yet effective:

<table><tr><td>Description</td><td>Effective for annual periods beginning on or after</td></tr><tr><td>Amendments to SFRS(I) 9 and SFRS(I) 7: Amendments to the Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments</td><td>1 January 2026</td></tr><tr><td>Amendments to SFRS(I) 9 and SFRS(I) 7: Contracts Referencing Nature-dependent Electricity</td><td>1 January 2026</td></tr><tr><td>Annual Improvements to SFRS(I)s – Volume 11</td><td>1 January 2026</td></tr><tr><td>SFRS(I) 18: Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements</td><td>1 January 2027</td></tr><tr><td>SFRS(I) 19: Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures</td><td>1 January 2027</td></tr><tr><td>Amendments to SFRS(I) 10 and SFRS(I) 1-28: Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture</td><td>To be determined</td></tr></table>

Except for the below, the directors expect that the adoption of the standards above will have no material impact on the financial statements in the year of initial application.

# SFRS(I) 18: Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements

SFRS(I) 18 replaces SFRS(I) 1-1 Presentation of Financial Statements. SFRS(I) 18 introduces new requirements for presentation within the statement of profit or loss, including specified totals and subtotals. Furthermore, entities are required to classify all income and expenses within the statement of profit or loss into one of five categories: operating, investing, financing, income taxes and discontinued operations, whereof the first three are new.

It also requires disclosure of newly defined management-defined performance measures, subtotals of income and expenses, and includes new requirements for aggregation and disaggregation of financial information based on the identified 'roles' of the primary financial statements (PFS) and the notes.

In addition, narrow-scope amendments have been made to SFRS(I) 1-7 Statement of Cash Flows, which include changing the starting point for determining cash flows from operations under the indirect method, from 'profit or loss' to 'operating profit or loss' and removing the optionality around classification of cash flows from dividends and interest. In addition, there are consequential amendments to several other standards.

SFRS(I) 18, and the amendments to the other standards, is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027, but earlier application is permitted and must be disclosed. SFRS(I) 18 will apply retrospectively.

The amendments will have impact on disclosure in the financial statements but not on the measurement or recognition of any items in the Group's financial statements.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For the financial year ended 31 December 2024

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT'D)

# 2.4 Basis of consolidation and business combinations

# (a) Basis of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries as at the end of the reporting period. The financial statements of the subsidiaries used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are prepared for the same reporting date as the Company. Consistent accounting policies are applied to like transactions and events in similar circumstances.

All intra-group balances, income and expenses and unrealised gains and losses resulting from intra-group transactions and dividends are eliminated in full.

Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.

Losses within a subsidiary are attributed to the non-controlling interest even if that results in a deficit balance.

If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it:

- de-recognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary at their carrying amounts at the date when control is lost;  
- de-recognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interest;  
- de-recognises the cumulative translation differences recorded in equity;  
- recognises the fair value of the consideration received;  
- recognises the fair value of any investment retained;  
- recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss;  
- re-classifies the Group's share of components previously recognised in other comprehensive income to profit or loss or revenue reserve, as appropriate.

# (b) Business combinations

Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are recognised as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are received.

When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For the financial year ended 31 December 2024

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT'D)

# 2.4 Basis of consolidation and business combinations (cont'd)

# (b) Business combinations (cont'd)

Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability, will be recognised in accordance with SFRS(1) 9 Financial Instruments either in profit or loss or as change to other comprehensive income. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured until it is finally settled within equity.

In business combinations achieved in stages, previously held equity interests in the acquiree are remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date and any corresponding gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.

The Group elects for each individual business combination, whether non-controlling interest in the acquiree (if any), that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of net assets in the event of liquidation, is recognised on the acquisition date at fair value, or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree identifiable net assets. Other components of non-controlling interests are measured at their acquisition date fair value, unless another measurement basis is required by another SFRS(I).

Any excess of the sum of the fair value of the consideration transferred in the business combination, the amount of non-controlling interest in the acquiree (if any), and the fair value of the Group's previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any), over the net fair value of the acquiree's identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. The accounting policy for goodwill is set out in Note 2.13. In instances where the latter amount exceeds the former, the excess is recognised as gain on bargain purchase in profit or loss on the acquisition date.

# 2.5 Foreign currencies

The Group's consolidated financial statements are presented in Singapore Dollars, which is also the Company's functional currency. Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.

Transactions arising in foreign currencies during the year are translated into functional currencies at rates closely approximating those ruling on the transaction dates. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities at the end of the reporting period are translated into functional currency at exchange rates ruling at the end of the reporting period. All exchange differences arising from such translations are included in the profit or loss. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Exchange differences arising from long-term inter-company balances which are effectively part of the net investments are recognised initially in other comprehensive income and accumulated under foreign currency translation reserve in equity.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For the financial year ended 31 December 2024

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT'D)

# 2.5 Foreign currencies (cont'd)

For inclusion in the consolidated financial statements, all assets and liabilities of foreign entities are translated into Singapore dollars at the exchange rates ruling at the end of the reporting period and the results of foreign entities are translated into Singapore dollars at the average exchange rates for the year. Exchange differences due to such currency translations are included in foreign currency translation reserve. On disposal of a foreign entity, such foreign currency translation reserve is recognised in profit or loss.

Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising from the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and are translated at the closing rate.

# 2.6 Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment loss. The cost of an asset comprises its purchase price and any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to working condition for its intended use. Expenditure for additions, improvements and renewals are capitalised and expenditure for maintenance and repairs are included in the profit or loss. When assets are sold or retired, their cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the statement of financial position and any gain or loss resulting from their disposal is included in the profit or loss.

The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

# 2.7 Leases

The Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

# Group as a lessee

The Group applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Group recognises lease liabilities to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets.

# Right-of-use assets

The Group recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets. The principal annual rates used for this purpose are:

<table><tr><td></td><td></td><td>%</td></tr><tr><td>Leasehold land and buildings</td><td>-</td><td>4 – 50</td></tr><tr><td>Office equipment</td><td>-</td><td>20 – 33 1/3</td></tr><tr><td>Motor vehicles</td><td>-</td><td>20 – 33 1/3</td></tr></table>

If ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Group at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset.

The right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment. Refer to section 2.15 Impairment of non-financial assets.

Lease liabilities

At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments to be made. The lease payments include fixed payments less any lease incentives receivable. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate.

In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments) or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset.

Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets

The Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low value assets are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

# Group as a lessor

Leases in which the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset are classified as operating leases. Rental income arising is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and is included in revenue in the statement of profit or loss due to its operating nature. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same basis as rental income. Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in the period in which they are earned.

# 2.8 Depreciation

Depreciation is not provided for freehold land due to its unlimited useful life and for construction-in-progress until it is completed and put into use.

Depreciation is calculated so as to write-off the cost of other property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned. The principal annual rates used for this purpose are:

<table><tr><td></td><td></td><td>%</td></tr><tr><td>Freehold buildings</td><td>-</td><td>2 – 2 1/2</td></tr><tr><td>Leasehold properties</td><td>-</td><td>1 1/3 – 6</td></tr><tr><td>Leasehold improvements</td><td>-</td><td>2 – 20</td></tr><tr><td>Plant and machinery</td><td>-</td><td>5 – 33 1/3</td></tr><tr><td>Furniture, fittings and office equipment</td><td>-</td><td>7 1/2 – 40</td></tr><tr><td>Motor vehicles</td><td>-</td><td>10 – 33 1/3</td></tr></table>

The useful life and depreciation method are reviewed annually to ensure that the method and period of depreciation are consistent with the expected pattern of economic benefits from items of property, plant and equipment. They are adjusted prospectively, if appropriate.

Fully depreciated assets are retained in the financial statements until they are no longer in use.

# 2.9 Subsidiaries

A subsidiary is an investee that is controlled by the Group. The Group controls an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.

In the Company's separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less impairment losses.

# 2.10 Investment in joint ventures

A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.

The considerations made in determining joint control are similar to those necessary to determine control over subsidiaries. The Group's investment in its joint venture is accounted for using the equity method.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For the financial year ended 31 December 2024

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT'D)

# 2.10 Investment in joint ventures (cont'd)

Under the equity method, the investment in a joint venture is initially recognised at cost. The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Group's share of net assets of the joint venture since the acquisition date. Goodwill relating to the joint venture is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is not tested for impairment separately.

The profit or loss reflects the Group's share of the results of operations of the joint venture. Distributions received from joint venture reduce the carrying amount of the investment. Any change in other comprehensive income of those investees is presented as part of the Group's other comprehensive income. In addition, when there has been a change recognised directly in the equity of the joint venture, the Group recognises its share of any changes, when applicable, in the statement of changes in equity. Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the joint venture are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the joint venture.

The aggregate of the Group's share of profit or loss of a joint venture is shown on the face of the profit or loss outside operating profit and represents profit or loss after tax and non-controlling interests in the subsidiaries of the joint venture.

The financial statements of the joint venture are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. When necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group.

After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an impairment loss on its investment in its joint venture. At each reporting date, the Group determines whether there is objective evidence that the investment in the joint venture is impaired. If there is such evidence, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the joint venture and its carrying value, and then recognises the loss within 'Share of profits of joint venture in the profit or loss.

Upon loss of joint control over the joint venture, the Group measures and recognises any retained investment at its fair value. Any difference between the carrying amount of the joint venture upon loss of joint control and the fair value of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in profit or loss.

# 2.11 Transactions with non-controlling interests

Non-controlling interests represent the equity in subsidiaries not attributable, directly or indirectly, to owners of the Company.

Changes in the Company's ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. In such circumstances, the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to owners of the Company.

# 2.12 Financial assets

# Initial recognition and measurement

Financial assets are recognised when, and only when the entity becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.

At initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss.

Trade receivables, which generally have 30-60 days terms, are measured at the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third party, if the trade receivables do not contain a significant financing component at initial recognition.

# Subsequent measurement

Investments in debt instruments

Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group's business model for managing the asset and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the asset. The three measurement categories for classification of debt instruments are:

(i) Amortised cost

Financial assets that are held for the collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. Financial assets are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the assets are derecognised or impaired, and through amortisation process.

(ii) Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)

Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets' cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at FVOCI. Financial assets measured at FVOCI are subsequently measured at fair value. Any gains or losses from changes in fair value of the financial assets are recognised in other comprehensive income, except for impairment losses, foreign exchange gains and losses and interest calculated using the effective interest method are recognised in profit or loss. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment when the financial asset is de-recognised.

(iii) Fair value through profit or loss

Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at fair value through profit or loss. A gain or loss on a debt instruments that is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss in the period in which it arises.

# Subsequent measurement (cont'd)

Investments in equity instruments

On initial recognition of an investment in equity instrument that is not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income. Dividends from such investments are to be recognised in profit or loss when the Group's right to receive payments is established. For investments in equity instruments which the Group has not elected to present subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income, changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss.

# Derecognition

A financial asset is derecognised where the contractual right to receive cash flows from the asset has expired. On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income for debt instruments is recognised in profit or loss.

# 2.13 Intangibles

(i) Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the acquirer's interest in the identifiable net assets. Goodwill which is assessed as having no continuing economic value is written-off immediately to the profit or loss.

Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment, annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.

(ii) Trademarks

Trademarks are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment loss. The useful lives of trademarks are assessed to be either finite or indefinite. Trademarks with finite lives are amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic useful lives of 20 years and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the trademark may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for trademarks with finite useful lives are reviewed at least at each financial year-end. The amortisation expense on trademarks with finite lives is recognised in profit or loss through the "amortisation and depreciation" line item.

For the financial year ended 31 December 2024

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT'D)

# 2.13 Intangibles (cont'd)

# (iii) Other intangible assets

Intangible assets acquired separately are measured initially at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial acquisition, intangible assets are measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Internally generated intangible assets, excluding capitalised development costs, are not capitalised and expenditure is reflected in profit or loss in the year in which the expenditure is incurred.

Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised over the estimated useful lives and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method are reviewed at least at each financial year-end. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset is accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite useful lives is recognised in profit or loss in the expense category consistent with the function of the intangible asset.

Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised.

# 2.14 Inventories

Raw materials, consumables, finished goods, work-in-progress and spare parts are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is primarily determined on a weighted average basis or first-in-first-out basis for certain subsidiaries, and includes all costs in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. In the case of manufactured products, cost includes all direct expenditure and production overheads based on the normal level of activity.

Net realisable value is the price at which the inventories can be realised in the normal course of business after allowing for the costs of realisation and, where appropriate, the cost of conversion from the existing state to a finished condition. Allowance is made, where necessary, for obsolete, slow-moving and defective inventories to adjust the carrying value of inventories to the lower of cost and net realisable value.

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT'D)

# 2.15 Impairment of non-financial assets

Goodwill

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group's cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the group are assigned to those units or groups of units. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is so allocated:

- Represents the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes; and  
- Is not larger than a segment based on either the Group's primary or the Group's secondary reporting format.

A cash-generating unit (or group of cash-generating units) to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the unit may be impaired, by comparing the carrying amount of the unit, including the goodwill, with the recoverable amount of the unit. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (or group of cash-generating units) is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised. Impairment losses recognised for goodwill are not reversed in subsequent periods.

Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit (or group of cash-generating units) and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.

# Other assets

Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Assets that have an indefinite useful life and are not subject to amortisation or depreciation are tested annually for impairment.

An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's or cash-generating unit's fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.

Reversal of impairment losses recognised in prior years is recorded when there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. However, the increased carrying amount of an asset due to a reversal of an impairment loss is recognised to the extent it does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortisation or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised for that asset in prior years. The reversal is recorded in the profit or loss.

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT'D)

# 2.16 Impairment of financial assets

The Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms.

ECLs are recognised in two stages. For credit exposures for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the next 12-months (a 12-month ECL). For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognised for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of timing of the default (a lifetime ECL).

For trade receivables, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment.

For debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income, the Group applies the low credit risk simplification. At every reporting date, the Group evaluates whether the debt instrument is considered to have low credit risk using all reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort. In making that evaluation, the Group reassesses the internal credit rating of the debt instrument. In addition, the Group considers that there has been a significant increase in credit risk when the contractual payments are more than 30 days past due.

However, in certain cases, the Group may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal or external information indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group. A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows.

# 2.17 Financial liabilities

Initial recognition and measurement

Financial liabilities are recognised when, and only when, the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument. The Group determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition.

All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value plus in the case of financial liabilities not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT'D)

# 2.17 Financial liabilities (cont'd)

Subsequent measurement

After initial recognition, financial liabilities that are not carried at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised, and through the amortisation process.

De-recognition

A financial liability is de-recognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. On derecognition, the difference between the carrying amounts and the consideration paid is recognised in profit or loss.

# 2.18 Provisions

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made on the amount of the obligation.

Provisions are reviewed at each end of the reporting period and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. If it is no longer probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, the provision is reversed.

# 2.19 Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and on hand, demand deposits, and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

# 2.20 Assets classified as held for sale

Assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.

The assets are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held-for-sale. Any impairment loss on initial classification and subsequent measurement is recognised as an expense. Any subsequent increase in fair value less costs to sell (not exceeding the accumulated impairment loss that has been previously recognised) is recognised in profit or loss.

# 2.21 Revenue recognition

Revenue is measured based on the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties.

Revenue is recognised when the Group satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to the customer, which is when the customer obtains control of the good or service. A performance obligation may be satisfied at a point in time or over time. The amount of revenue recognised is the amount allocated to the satisfied performance obligation.

Revenue is recognised when the goods are delivered to the customer and all criteria for acceptance have been satisfied. The goods may be sold with a right of return and with retrospective volume discounts based on the aggregate sales over a period of time.

The amount of revenue recognised is based on the estimated transaction price, which comprises the contractual price, net of the estimated volume discounts and adjusted for expected returns. Based on the Group's experience with similar types of contracts, variable consideration is typically constrained and is included in the transaction only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.

The Group recognises the expected volume discounts payable to customer where consideration have been received from customers and refunds due to expected returns from customers as refund liabilities. Separately, the Group recognises a related asset for the right to recover the returned goods, based on the former carrying amount of the good less expected costs to recover the goods, and adjusts them against cost of sales correspondingly.

At the end of each reporting date, the Group updates its assessment of the estimated transaction price, including its assessment of whether an estimate of variable consideration is constrained. The corresponding amounts are adjusted against revenue in the period in which the transaction price changes. The Group also updates its measurement of the asset for the right to recover returned goods for changes in its expectations about returned goods.

Rental income is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. The aggregate costs of incentives provided to lessees are recognised as a reduction of rental income over the lease term on a straight-line basis.

Interest income is recognised on effective interest rate method.

Dividend income is recorded gross in profit or loss in the accounting period in which the Group's right to receive payment is established.

Deferred income represents revenue collected but not earned as at end of reporting period. It is recognised as income in profit or loss when the revenue recognition criteria has been met.

# 2.22 Income taxes

Current tax

Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.

Current taxes are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that the tax relates to items recognised directly in equity. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretations and establishes provisions where appropriate.

# Deferred tax

Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the end of the reporting period between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences, except:

- Where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and  
- In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax losses can be utilised except:

- Where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and  
- In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.

Deferred tax (cont'd)

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at the end of each reporting period and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of each reporting period.

Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss. Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity and deferred tax arising from a business combination is adjusted against goodwill on acquisition.

Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current income tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.

Sales tax

Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax except:

- Where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable; and  
- Receivables and payables that are stated with the amount of sales tax included.

# 2.23 Borrowing costs

Borrowing costs are capitalised as part of the cost of a qualifying asset if they are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of that asset. Capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when the activities to prepare the asset for its intended use or sale are in progress and the expenditures and borrowing costs are incurred. Borrowing costs are capitalised until the assets are substantially completed for their intended use or sale. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.

# 2.24 Employee benefits

# (i) Defined contribution plans

As required by law, the Group's companies in Singapore make contributions to the state pension scheme, the Central Provident Fund ("CPF"). Certain of the Group's companies outside Singapore make contributions to their respective countries' pension scheme. Such contributions are recognised as compensation expense in the same period as the employment that gives rise to the contribution.

# (ii) Defined benefit plan

The net defined benefit liability or asset is the aggregate of the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period reduced by the fair value of plan assets (if any), adjusted for any effect of limiting a net defined benefit asset to the asset ceiling. The asset ceiling is the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.

The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit method.

Defined benefit costs comprise the following:

Service cost  
- Net interest on the net defined benefit liability or asset  
- Remeasurements of net defined benefit liability or asset

Service costs which include current service costs, past service costs and gains or losses on non-routine settlements are recognised as expense in profit or loss. Past service costs are recognised when plan amendment or curtailment occurs.

Net interest on the net defined benefit liability or asset is the change during the period in the net defined benefit liability or asset that arises from the passage of time which is determined by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. Net interest on the net defined benefit liability or asset is recognised as expense or income in profit or loss.

Remeasurements comprising actuarial gains and losses, return on plan assets and any change in the effect of the asset ceiling (excluding net interest on defined benefit liability) are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. Remeasurements are recognised in revenue reserve within equity and are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.

# 2.24 Employee benefits (cont'd)

# (ii) Defined benefit plan (cont'd)

Plan assets are assets that are held by a long-term employee benefit fund or qualifying insurance policies. Plan assets are not available to the creditors of the Group, nor can they be paid directly to the Group. Fair value of plan assets is based on market price information. When no market price is available, the fair value of plan assets is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using a discount rate that reflects both the risk associated with the plan assets and the maturity or expected disposal date of those assets (or, if they have no maturity, the expected period until the settlement of the related obligations).

The Group's right to be reimbursed of some or all of the expenditure required to settle a defined benefit obligation is recognised as a separate asset at fair value when and only when reimbursement is virtually certain.

# (iii) Employee entitlements

Liabilities for paid annual leave and sick leave are recognised and measured as the amount unpaid at the end of the reporting period at current pay rates in respect of employees' services up to that date.

A liability for long service leave is recognised, on the basis of an estimation of the present value of the future cash outflows to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the end of the reporting period. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service. Expected future payments are discounted using interest rates that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows.

# 2.25 Segment information

For management purposes, the Group is organised into operating segments based on their products and services. The management of the Company regularly reviews the segment results in order to allocate resources to the segments and to assess the segment performance. Additional disclosures on each of these segments are shown in Note 36, including the factors used to identify the reportable segments and the measurement basis of segment information.

# 2.26 Contingencies

A contingent liability is:

(a) a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group; or  
(b) a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because:

(i) It is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; or  
(ii) The amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.

Contingent liabilities are not recognised on the balance sheet of the Group, except for contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination that are present obligations and which the fair values can be reliably determined.

# 2.27 Significant accounting estimates and judgements

The preparation of the Group's consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the end of each reporting period. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in the future periods.

Judgements made in applying accounting policies

In the process of applying the Group's accounting policies, management is of the opinion that there is no instance of application of judgement which is expected to have a significant impact on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements, apart from those involving estimations described below.

Key sources of estimation uncertainty

The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period are discussed below. The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.

# 2. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION (CONT'D)

# 2.27 Significant accounting estimates and judgements (cont'd)

Key sources of estimation uncertainty (cont'd)

(i) Impairment of investment in joint venture

The Group assesses whether there are any indicators of impairment for the investment in joint venture at each reporting date. When there is objective evidence, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the joint venture and determines if an impairment loss should be recognised.

Estimating the recoverable amount requires management to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows to be generated by the joint venture and determine a suitable discount rate to calculate the present value of those cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on management's estimate of the expected revenue growth.

During the year, the Group recognised a non-cash impairment of  $1,200,000 (2023:$ 9,503,000) on the Group's investment in joint venture.

The carrying amount of the investment in joint venture as at 31 December 2024 is  $48,168,000 (2023:$ 46,605,000).

(ii) Provision for expected credit losses of trade receivables

The Group uses a provision matrix to calculate ECLs for trade receivables. The provision rates are based on days past due for groupings of various customer segments that have similar loss patterns.

The provision matrix is initially based on the Group's historical observed default rates. The Group will calibrate the matrix to adjust historical credit loss experience with forward-looking information. At every reporting date, historical default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.

The assessment of the correlation between historical observed default rates, forecast economic conditions and ECLs is a significant estimate. The amount of ECLs is sensitive to changes in circumstances and of forecast economic conditions. The Group's historical credit loss experience and forecast of economic conditions may also not be representative of customer's actual default in the future. The information about the ECLs on the Group's trade receivables is disclosed in Note 12.

The carrying amount of trade receivables as at 31 December 2024 is  $89,609,000 (2023:$ 93,681,000).

Key sources of estimation uncertainty (cont'd)

# (iii) Impairment of non-financial assets

The Group assesses whether there are any indicators of impairment for all non-financial assets at each reporting date. Non-financial assets, other than goodwill are tested for impairment when there are indicators that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.

When value-in-use calculations are undertaken, management estimates the expected future cash flows from the asset or cash-generating unit and determines a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.

# (iv) Income taxes

The Group operates in various countries and is subject to different tax jurisdictions. Significant judgement is involved in determining the provision for income taxes. There are certain transactions and computations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. The Group recognises liabilities for expected tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recognised, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made. The carrying amount of the Company's and the Group's income tax payable as at 31 December 2024 was  $691,000 (2023:$ 585,000) and  $4,510,000 (2023:$ 4,626,000) respectively. The carrying amount of the Group's tax recoverable as at 31 December 2024 was  $7,323,000 (2023:$ 6,919,000). The carrying amount of the Company's deferred tax liabilities as at 31 December 2024 was  $1,239,000 (2023:$ 958,000). The Group's deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as at 31 December 2024 was  $4,491,000 (2023:$ 3,964,000) and $7,132,000 (2023: $6,442,000) respectively.

# (v) Assets held for sale

The Group has classified certain plant and equipment and related spare parts as held for sale as a subsidiary has intention to sell these assets. These assets are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell, based on a valuation performed as of 31 December 2024. The Group recognised an impairment of  $1,907,000 during the year. The carrying amount of assets classified as held for sale as at 31 December 2024 is$ 3,586,000 (2023: $5,736,000).

# 17. RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS

# Group as a lessee

The Group has lease contracts for certain office premises, factories, warehousing/trading facilities, office equipment and motor vehicles used in its operations. The Group's obligations under its leases are secured by the lessor's title to the leased assets. Generally, the Group is restricted from assigning and subleasing the leased assets. There are several lease contracts that include extension and termination options and variable lease payments, which are further discussed below.

The Group also has certain leases of machinery with lease terms of 12 months or less and leases of office equipment with low value. The Group applies the 'short-term lease' and 'lease of low-value assets' recognition exemptions for these leases.

# 20. INVESTMENT IN JOINT VENTURE

The Group has  $50\%$  interest in the ownership and voting rights of Gardenia Bakeries (KL) Sdn Bhd ("GBKL") that is held through a subsidiary. This joint venture is incorporated in Malaysia. The Group jointly controls the venture with the remaining shareholder under a contractual agreement which requires unanimous consent for all major decisions over the relevant activities. Under certain specified circumstances if the objective to list GBKL is not achieved by March 2028 and there is no acquisition by one shareholder of the shares of the other in accordance with the contract, GBKL shall be wound up and the contract shall terminate.

During the year, the Group performed an assessment on the recoverable amount of its investment in joint venture. The recoverable amount of the investment was determined based on cash flow projections approved by management. Key assumptions include the revenue growth rates and discount rate. The pre-tax discount rate is  $9.5\%$  (2023:  $9.5\%$ ). Accordingly, a partial, non-cash impairment of $1.2 million (2023: $9.5 million) has been recognised as part of the Group's share of profits of joint venture.

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# 33. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES

The Group and the Company are exposed to financial risks arising from its operations and the use of financial instruments. The key financial risks include credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency risk.

It is, and has been throughout the current and previous financial year, the Group's policy not to hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

The following sections provide details regarding the Group's and Company's exposure to the above-mentioned financial risks and the objectives, policies and processes for the management of these risks.

# (a) Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk that entities and individuals will be unable to meet their obligations to the Group resulting in financial loss to the Group. It is the Group's policy to enter into transactions with a diversity of creditworthy parties to mitigate any significant concentration of credit risk. The Group ensures that sales of products and services are made to customers with appropriate credit history and has internal mechanisms to monitor the granting of credit and management of credit exposures. The Group has made allowances, where necessary, for potential losses on credits extended.

The Group considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of asset and whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis throughout each reporting period.

The Group has determined the default event on a financial asset to be when the counterparty fails to make contractual payments, within 90 days, when they fall due, which are derived based on the Group's historical information.

To assess whether there is a significant increase in credit risk, the Group compares the risk of a default occurring on the asset as at reporting date with the risk of default as at the date of initial recognition.

A significant increase in credit risk is presumed if a debtor is more than 30 days past due in making contractual payment.

The Group determined that its financial assets are credit-impaired when:

There is significant difficulty of the issuer or the borrower  
- A breach of contract, such as a default or past due event  
- It is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation  
There is a disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulty

# NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For the financial year ended 31 December 2024

# 33. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONT'D)

# (a) Credit risk (cont'd)

In calculating the expected credit loss rates, the Group considers historical loss rates for each category of receivables and adjusts to reflect current and forward-looking macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the debtors to settle the receivables. The Group has identified the gross domestic product (GDP) and the unemployment rate of the countries in which it sells goods and services to be the most relevant factors, and accordingly adjusts the historical loss rates based on expected changes in these factors.

Financial assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, such as a debtor failing to engage in a repayment plan with the Group. Where receivables have been written off, the company continues to engage in enforcement activity to attempt to recover the receivables due. Where recoveries are made, these are recognised in profit or loss.

# Exposure to credit risk

At the end of the reporting period, the Group's and the Company's maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by:

- The carrying amount of each class of financial assets recognised in the statements of financial position; and  
- A nominal amount of  $8,460,000 (2023:$ 9,010,000) relating to corporate guarantees provided by the Company for bank facilities granted to subsidiaries, of which, the amounts utilised by subsidiaries as at the end of the reporting period were $Nil (2023: $Nil).

Information regarding credit enhancements for trade receivables is disclosed in Note 12.

# (b) Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group or the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting financial obligations due to shortage of funds. The Group's and the Company's exposure to liquidity risk arises primarily from mismatches of the maturities of financial assets and liabilities. The Group's and the Company's objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of stand-by credit facilities.

The Group's and the Company's liquidity risk management policy is to maintain sufficient liquid financial assets and have an adequate amount of committed credit facilities.

# 33. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES (CONT'D)

# (c) Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of the Group's financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group's exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from its loans, borrowings and fixed deposits with financial institutions.

The Group's policy is to manage interest cost using a mix of fixed and floating rate debts.

Sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk

The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Group's profit after tax.

<table><tr><td rowspan="2">Loans and fixed deposits denominated in</td><td rowspan="2">Increase/ decrease in basis points</td><td colspan="2">Effect on profit after tax</td></tr><tr><td>2024 $’000</td><td>2023 $’000</td></tr><tr><td>Australian Dollar</td><td>+50</td><td>519</td><td>541</td></tr><tr><td>Australian Dollar</td><td>-50</td><td>(519)</td><td>(541)</td></tr><tr><td>Malaysian Ringgit</td><td>+50</td><td>26</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Malaysian Ringgit</td><td>-50</td><td>(26)</td><td>(1)</td></tr><tr><td>Philippine Peso</td><td>+50</td><td>(25)</td><td>(47)</td></tr><tr><td>Philippine Peso</td><td>-50</td><td>25</td><td>47</td></tr></table>

# (d) Foreign currency risk

The Group has transactional currency exposures arising from sales or purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currencies of Group entities, primarily Singapore Dollar (SGD), Malaysian Ringgit (MYR), Philippine Peso (Peso) and Australian Dollar (AUD). The foreign currencies in which these transactions are denominated are mainly AUD. As at the end of the reporting period, the Group's net exposure to AUD (mainly relating to receivables, payables and cash and cash equivalents) amounted to  $133,251,000 (2023:$ 135,211,000).

The Group is also exposed to currency translation risk arising from its net investments in foreign operations, including Malaysia, the Philippines and Australia. The Group's net investments in Malaysia, the Philippines and Australia are not hedged as currency positions in MYR, Peso and AUD are considered to be long-term in nature.

# 35. FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

Fair value of financial instruments by classes that are not carried at fair value and whose carrying amounts are reasonable approximation of fair value

Management has determined that the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, current trade and other receivables, current trade and other payables, current bank loans and non-current floating rate loans based on their notional amounts, reasonably approximate their fair values because these are mostly short term in nature or are repriced frequently.

# 36. SEGMENTAL REPORTING

For management purposes, the Group is currently organised into business units based on their products and services, and has four reportable segments as follows:

(i) Bakery - Manufacture and distribution of bread, confectionery and bakery products  
(ii) Distribution and warehousing Trading and distribution of food and beverage products and provision for warehousing logistics for food items  
(iii) Investments and others Investment holding and other activities

Except as indicated above, no operating segments have been aggregated to form the above reportable operating segments.

Management monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit or loss which in certain respects, as explained in the table below, is measured differently from operating profit or loss in the consolidated financial statements. Group financing (including finance costs) and income taxes are managed on a group basis and are not allocated to operating segments.

Transfer prices between operating segments are on an arm's length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.

# 38. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

The Group's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern and to maintain an optimal capital structure. In order to maintain or achieve an optimal capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividend payment, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, buy back issued shares, obtain new borrowings or sell assets to reduce borrowings.

Management monitors capital based on a gearing or net debt-to-equity ratio. The net debt-to-equity ratio is calculated as net debt divided by shareholders' funds. Net debt is calculated as bank borrowings and lease liabilities less cash and cash equivalents. Shareholders' fund relates to equity attributable to owners of the parent. There were no changes to the Group's approach to capital management during the year.

# NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING

(b) A member of the Company who is a relevant intermediary is entitled to appoint more than two (2) proxies to attend, speak and vote at the AGM, but each proxy must be appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by such member. Where such member's proxy form appoints more than two (2) proxies, the number and class of shares in relation to which each proxy has been appointed shall be specified in the proxy form. In relation to a relevant intermediary who wishes to appoint more than two (2) proxies, it should annex to the proxy form the list of proxies, setting out, in respect of each proxy, the name, address, NRIC/Passport Number and proportion of shareholding (number of shares, class of shares and percentage) in relation to which the proxy has been appointed. If the relevant information is not specified, the first named proxy shall be deemed to represent 100 per cent of the shareholdings. For the avoidance of doubt, a CPF Agent Bank who intends to appoint CPF/SRS investors as its proxies shall comply with this Note.

"Relevant intermediary" has the meaning ascribed to it in Section 181 of the Companies Act 1967 of Singapore.

Completion and return of the instrument appointing a proxy shall not preclude a member from attending, speaking and voting at the AGM. Any appointment of a proxy or proxies shall be deemed to be revoked if a member attends the AGM in person and, in such event, the Company reserves the right to refuse to admit any person or persons appointed under the relevant instrument of proxy, to the AGM.

7. The Company shall be entitled to reject an instrument of proxy which is incomplete, improperly completed, illegible or where the true intentions of the appointor are not ascertainable from the instructions of the appointor specified on the instrument of proxy (including any related attachment). In addition, in the case of shares entered in the Depository Register, the Company may reject an instrument of proxy if the member, being the appointor, is not shown to have shares entered against his name in the Depository Register as at 72 hours before the time appointed for the AGM, as certified by The Central Depository (Pte) Limited to the Company. A Depositor shall not be regarded as a member of the Company entitled to attend the AGM and to speak and vote thereat unless his name appears on the Depository Register 72 hours before the time appointed for the AGM.

8. Members may submit questions related to the resolutions to be tabled for approval at the AGM to the Chairman of the meeting, in advance of the AGM in the following manner:

Dear Shareholders

# 1. INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this Appendix is to provide Shareholders with information relating to the proposed renewal of the IPT Mandate, which is referred to in Ordinary Resolution 10 set out in the notice convening the 2025 AGM to be held on 25 April 2025.

The SGX-ST assumes no responsibility for the correctness of any of the statements made, reports contained or opinions expressed in this Appendix.

# 2. THE PROPOSED RENEWAL OF THE IPT MANDATE

# 2.1 Existing IPT Mandate

At the 2024 AGM, the Shareholders had approved the renewal of the IPT Mandate to authorise the entry by the Company and its entities at risk (as defined in Rule 904(2) of the Listing Manual) into any of the transactions falling within certain types of interested person transactions as set out in the IPT Mandate. Particulars of the IPT Mandate were set out in the appendix circulated to Shareholders together with the annual report of the Company for FY2023.

The IPT Mandate was expressed to take effect until the conclusion of the then next annual general meeting of the Company, namely, the 2025 AGM which is scheduled to be held on 25 April 2025. Accordingly, Shareholders' approval is being sought for the renewal of the IPT Mandate at the 2025 AGM.

# 2.2 Chapter 9 of the Listing Manual

Chapter 9 of the Listing Manual governs transactions by a listed company, as well as transactions by its subsidiaries and associated companies that are considered to be entities at risk, with the listed company's interested persons. The purpose is to guard against the risk that interested persons could influence the listed company, its subsidiaries or associated companies to enter into transactions with interested persons that may adversely affect the interests of the listed company or its shareholders.

Under Chapter 9 of the Listing Manual, where a listed company or any of its subsidiaries or any of its associated companies which are controlled by the listed group and its interested person(s) (other than a subsidiary or associated company that is listed on the SGX-ST or an approved exchange) proposes to enter into transactions with the listed company's interested persons, the listed company is required to make an immediate announcement, or to make an immediate announcement and seek its shareholders' approval if the value of the transaction is equal to or exceeds certain financial thresholds. In particular:

(a) where the value of such transaction is equal to or exceeds  $3\%$  of the latest audited consolidated NTA of the listed company and its subsidiaries and is less than  $5\%$  of the latest audited consolidated NTA of the listed company and its subsidiaries, an immediate announcement is required;  
(b) where the value of such transaction is equal to or exceeds  $5\%$  of the latest audited consolidated NTA of the listed company and its subsidiaries, an immediate announcement and shareholders' approval is required;  
(c) if the aggregate value of all transactions entered into with the same interested person during the same financial year amounts to  $3\%$  or more of the latest audited consolidated NTA of the listed company and its subsidiaries, the listed company must make an immediate announcement of the latest transaction and all future transactions entered into with that same interested person during that financial year; and  
(d) if the aggregate value of all transactions entered into with the same interested person during the same financial year amounts to  $5\%$  or more of the latest audited consolidated NTA of the listed company and its subsidiaries, an immediate announcement must be made and shareholders' approval must be obtained in respect of the latest and all future transactions entered into with that interested person during that financial year.

In the event the latest audited consolidated NTA of the listed company and its subsidiaries is negative, the listed company is required to consult the SGX-ST on the appropriate benchmark to calculate the relevant thresholds, which may be based on its market capitalisation.

Based on the provisions of the Listing Manual, the rules as to making announcements and seeking shareholders' approval referred to above do not apply to transactions below S $100,000. However, while transactions below S$ 100,000 are not normally aggregated under the relevant provisions of the Listing Manual, the SGX-ST may aggregate any such transaction entered into during the same financial year and treat them as if they were one transaction.

For Shareholders' information, the audited consolidated NTA of the Group as at 31 December 2024 amounted to approximately S $499.57 million. \(3\%$  and  $5\%$  of such audited consolidated NTA of the Group amounts to approximately S\)14.99 million and S$24.98 million, respectively.

Chapter 9 of the Listing Manual permits a listed company, however, to seek a general mandate from its shareholders for recurrent transactions of a revenue or trading nature or those necessary for its day-to-day operations such as the purchase and sale of supplies and materials (but not in respect of the purchase or sale of assets, undertakings or businesses) that may be carried out with the listed company's interested persons. Transactions conducted under a general mandate are not subject to the rules on making announcements and seeking shareholders' approval referred to above.

Under the Listing Manual:

(i) an "entity at risk" means:

(a) the listed company;  
(b) a subsidiary of the listed company that is not listed on the SGX-ST or an approved exchange; or  
(c) an associated company of the listed company that is not listed on the SGX-ST or an approved exchange, provided that the listed group, or the listed group and its interested person(s), has control over the associated company;

(ii) an "interested person" means a director, chief executive officer or controlling shareholder of the listed company or an associate of any such director, chief executive officer or controlling shareholder. The SGX-ST may deem any person or entity to be an interested person if the person or entity has entered into, or proposes to enter into, (a) a transaction with an entity at risk, and (b) an agreement or arrangement with an interested person in connection with that transaction;

(iii) an "associate":

(1) in relation to any director, chief executive officer, substantial shareholder or controlling shareholder (being an individual) means:

# 2.3 Background

The Group is principally engaged in the businesses of bakery and distribution and warehousing. For its bakery business, the Group, including its joint venture(s), manufactures and distributes bread and bakery products in Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines and Australia. For its distribution and warehousing business, the Group undertakes wholesale distribution of a range of third-party and proprietary-branded processed food and beverage products, and provides logistics operations including distribution and warehousing.

As at the Latest Practicable Date, Mr Lam Sing Chung, Chairman of the Board, has a shareholding interest of approximately  $31.03\%$  in the Company and is a Controlling Shareholder of the Company. Mr Lin Kejian, Joint Group Managing Director of the Company, is the son of Mr Lam Sing Chung and is also a Controlling Shareholder of the Company with a shareholding interest of approximately  $39.12\%$  in the Company as at the Latest Practicable Date.

The Group may from time to time enter into transactions with Mr Lam Sing Chung, Mr Lin Kejian and/or their respective associates ("Interested Persons") in the ordinary course of business. Such transactions include the purchase of products and raw materials from, as well as the sale of products to, certain parties which are Interested Persons.

The transactions entered into in FY2024 with Interested Persons pursuant to the IPT Mandate are set out on page 115 of the Annual Report in the section entitled "FY2024 Interested Person Transactions". Please refer to the aforesaid section for more information. For example, the Group purchased raw materials such as flour from the Salim Group<sup>1</sup>. The Salim Group is an Interested Person as Mr Anthoni Salim is the brother of Mr Lam Sing Chung. The aggregate value of the flour purchased amounted to approximately S$13.66 million, being less than 3% (that is, approximately 2.81%) of the then latest audited

consolidated NTA of the Group. In addition, the Group sold cheese in bulk to, and purchased processed cheese from, Austral Dairy Group Sdn Bhd ("Austral"). Austral is an Interested Person as it is an entity in which Mr Lam Sing Chung, Ms Rachel Liem Yuan Fang and her immediate family member have an interest. The aggregate value of the cheese sold and purchased amounted to approximately S\(3 million and S\)2.73 million respectively, each being less than \(3\%\) (that is approximately \(0.62\%\) and \(0.56\%\), respectively) of the then latest audited consolidated NTA of the Group. In addition to processed cheese, the Group purchased other finished products such as vegetables, milk and electricity from the Interested Persons. The aggregate value of finished products purchased amounted to approximately S\)5.97 million, being less than \(3\%\) (that is approximately \(1.23\%\)) of the then latest audited consolidated NTA of the Group.

# 2.4 Rationale for and Benefits of the Renewal of the IPT Mandate

The Group envisages that the Interested Person Transactions will occur with some degree of frequency and could arise at any time and from time to time. Such transactions are recurring transactions and are part of the day-to-day operations of the Group.

The renewal of the IPT Mandate, if approved by the Shareholders, will enable the Group, in the ordinary course of business, to undertake such transactions in a more expeditious manner. It will also enhance the Group's ability to pursue business opportunities which may be time-sensitive and frequent in nature and will allow the Group to conduct its business efficiently by eliminating the need to convene separate general meetings from time to time to seek Shareholders' approval as and when potential Interested Person Transactions arise. The IPT Mandate will reduce the expenses involved with the convening of general meetings on an ad hoc basis and allow manpower resources and time to be channeled towards attaining other corporate objectives.

# 2.5 Classes of Interested Persons

The IPT Mandate will apply to the Interested Persons in relation to the types of transactions set out in Section 2.6 below. The associates of the Interested Persons who will have dealings under the IPT Mandate include the Salim Group, which is controlled by Mr Anthoni Salim, who is Mr Lam Sing Chung's brother.

# 2.6 Types of Transactions under the IPT Mandate

The types of transactions contemplated under the IPT Mandate are as follows:

(a) the purchase of products and raw materials; and  
(b) the sale of products.

The types of products and/or raw materials covered under the IPT Mandate will be those which are transacted by the Group in its ordinary course of business with the Interested Persons in connection with the latter's ordinary course of business. Such transactions include for example, the purchase of flour and may also include wheat-related raw materials, such as wheat bran and wheat germ, from the Salim Group, and finished products such as vegetables and electricity $^2$  from the Salim Group and processed cheese from Austral.

# 2.7 Review Procedures under the IPT Mandate

The Group maintains a register of Interested Person Transactions and the following review procedures are implemented by the Company:

# 2.7.1 Review Procedures

(a) When purchasing products and/or raw materials from an Interested Person, quotations from at least two (2) other unrelated third party vendors for similar quantities and/or quality will be obtained (whenever possible or available) for comparison to ascertain whether the price and terms offered by the Interested Person are fair and reasonable and competitive compared to those offered by such other unrelated third party vendors. In determining whether the price and terms offered by the Interested Person are fair and reasonable, pertinent factors, including but not limited to quality, track record, specification compliance, delivery time, experience and expertise, and where applicable, terms offered to third parties, preferential rates, discounts or rebates accorded for bulk purchases, may also be taken into consideration.

In the event that such competitive quotations cannot be obtained (for instance, if there are no unrelated third party vendors providing or selling a similar type of product or raw material or if the unrelated third party vendor(s) is not able to meet the Group's specifications or in cases of urgency), an Executive Director (other than an Interested Person) or the Audit & Risk Committee (as the case may be depending on the approval threshold as set out in Section 2.7.2 below) will determine whether the price and terms offered by the Interested Person are fair and reasonable. In determining the transaction price payable to the Interested Person for such products and/or raw materials, pertinent factors, including but not limited to quality, track record, specification compliance, delivery time, experience and expertise, reliability and/or efficiency of the seller, strategic considerations, and where applicable, terms offered to third parties, preferential rates, discounts or rebates accorded for bulk purchases, may also be taken into consideration.

(b) When selling products to an Interested Person, the pricing or fees for the products are to be carried out at the prevailing market rates or prices of the products, on terms no more favourable to the Interested Person than the usual commercial terms extended to unrelated third parties (including, where applicable, preferential rates, discounts and/or rebates accorded to corporate customers or for bulk purchases) or otherwise in accordance with applicable industry norms.

In the event that prevailing market rates or prices are not available (for instance due to the nature of the product to be sold or if there are no other customers for similar products or if the unrelated third party customer(s) is not able to meet the Group's specifications or in cases of urgency), the transaction prices will, where applicable, (i) be in accordance with the Group's usual business practices and pricing policies, consistent with the usual margin of the Group for the same or substantially similar type(s) of transaction with unrelated third parties, or (ii) in certain cases (for example, waste disposal or technical expertise) be determined by reference to factors including but not limited to track record, specification compliance, quantity, volume, duration of contract, strategic considerations, reliability and/or efficiency of the purchaser, extent of cost recovery, industry norms and where applicable, preferential rates, discounts or rebates accorded for bulk purchases, may also be taken into consideration.

# 2.7.2 Approval Thresholds

The following approval thresholds shall be adopted in respect of the Interested Person Transactions:

<table><tr><td></td><td>Value of Interested Person Transaction(s)</td><td>Approving Authorities (each having no interest, direct or indirect, in the Interested Person Transaction)</td></tr><tr><td>1.</td><td>An Interested Person Transaction the value of which is equal to or exceeds S$100,000,(1) but less than 3% of the latest audited consolidated NTA of the Group from time to time(2)</td><td>Executive Director or such senior executive of the Group as may be designated by the Audit &amp; Risk Committee from time to time
If an Executive Director or relevant senior executive of the Group is himself interested in an Interested Person Transaction, the Interested Person Transaction will be reviewed and approved by another Executive Director or senior executive (each having no interest, direct or indirect, in the Interested Person Transaction)</td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>(i) Where the value of an Interested Person Transaction, when aggregated with the value of all previous Interested Person Transactions of the same kind in the same financial year, is equal to or exceeds 3% of the latest audited consolidated NTA of the Group from time to time(2), such Interested Person Transaction and all future Interested Person Transactions of the same kind during the financial year in question, Provided That any Interested Person Transaction below S$100,000 in value does not require approval and shall be disregarded for aggregation purposes
(ii) An Interested Person Transaction the value of which is equal to or exceeds 3% of the latest audited consolidated NTA of the Group from time to time(2)</td><td>Audit &amp; Risk Committee</td></tr></table>

Notes:  
(1) Based on the existing provisions of the Listing Manual.  
(2) Based on the audited consolidated financial statements of the Group for FY2024, \(3\%\) of the latest audited consolidated NTA of the Group would be approximately S\\(14.99 million.

The approving authorities may request for additional information pertaining to the transaction under review as they deem fit.

# 2.7.3 Interested Audit & Risk Committee Member to Abstain

In the event that a member of the Audit & Risk Committee (where applicable) is interested (directly or indirectly) in any Interested Person Transaction, he or she will abstain from reviewing that particular transaction. Approval of that transaction will accordingly be undertaken by the remaining members of the Audit & Risk Committee.

# 2.7.4 Periodic Review by Audit & Risk Committee

The Audit & Risk Committee will review all Interested Person Transactions (including transactions with Interested Persons the values of which are below S$100,000) on a quarterly basis to ascertain whether the established review procedures for the Interested Person Transactions have been complied with and the relevant approvals have been obtained.

The Audit & Risk Committee will also review the established review procedures of the Interested Person Transactions and determine if such review procedures continue to be adequate in ensuring that the Interested Person Transactions are conducted on normal commercial terms and are not prejudicial to the interests of the Company and its minority Shareholders. If the Audit & Risk Committee is of the view that the review procedures have become inappropriate or insufficient to meet such objectives, the Company will seek a fresh mandate from its Shareholders based on new review procedures for the Interested Person Transactions.

# 2.8 Excluded Transactions

The IPT Mandate will not cover any transaction with an Interested Person that is below S\(100,000 in value, as the provisions of Chapter 9 of the Listing Manual provide that any such transaction is to be disregarded although the SGX-ST may aggregate any such transaction entered into during the same financial year and treat them as if they were one transaction.

Transactions between the Group and the Interested Persons which do not fall within the ambit of the IPT Mandate shall be subject to the relevant provisions of Chapter 9 of the Listing Manual, or other applicable provisions of the Listing Manual, if any.

# 2.9 Validity Period of the Renewed IPT Mandate

If approved by Shareholders at the 2025 AGM, the renewed IPT Mandate will take effect from the passing of the ordinary resolution relating thereto at the 2025 AGM (Ordinary Resolution 10 in the Notice of Annual General Meeting), and will (unless revoked or varied by the Company in general meeting) continue in force until the conclusion of the next annual general meeting of the Company or the date by which the next annual general meeting of the Company is required by law to be held, whichever is earlier.

Approval from Shareholders will be sought for the renewal of the IPT Mandate at the 2025 AGM and at each subsequent annual general meeting of the Company, subject to satisfactory review by the Audit & Risk Committee of its continued application to transactions with the Interested Persons.

# 2.10 Disclosure

Disclosure will be made in the Company's Annual Report of the aggregate value of the transactions conducted with Interested Persons pursuant to the IPT Mandate during the relevant financial year, and in the annual reports for the subsequent financial years that the IPT Mandate continues in force, in accordance with the requirements and form set out in Chapter 9 of the Listing Manual.

# 2.12 Statement by the Audit & Risk Committee

The Audit & Risk Committee of the Company having considered, inter alia, the terms of the IPT Mandate, confirms that the review procedures for determining the transaction prices of the Interested Person Transactions as set out in Section 2.7 of this Appendix have not changed since the last shareholder approval for the IPT Mandate at the 2024 AGM. The Audit & Risk Committee is also of the view that such review procedures for determining the transaction prices of the Interested Person Transactions, when taken as a whole and if applied consistently, are sufficient to ensure that the Interested Person Transactions will be carried out on normal commercial terms and will not be prejudicial to the interests of the Company and its minority Shareholders. However, should the Audit & Risk Committee subsequently no longer be of this opinion, the Company will revert to the Shareholders for a fresh mandate based on new review procedures for transactions with the Interested Persons.

# 3. DIRECTORS' RECOMMENDATION

The Directors of the Company (save for the Directors referred to below), having considered, amongst other things, the rationale for and benefits of the renewal of the IPT Mandate, the review procedures and the role of the Audit & Risk Committee, are of the opinion that the proposed renewal of the IPT Mandate is in the interests of the Company. Accordingly, the Directors (save for the Directors referred to below) recommend that Shareholders vote in favour of the ordinary resolution in respect of the proposed renewal of the IPT Mandate at the 2025 AGM.

Mr Lam Sing Chung and Mr Lin Kejian (being the Interested Persons) abstain from making any recommendation.

As different Shareholders might have different investment objectives, Shareholders should consult their stockbroker, bank manager, solicitor, accountant or other professional advisers if they require specific advice in relation to the proposed renewal of the IPT Mandate.

# 4. ABSTENTION FROM VOTING

Rule 919 of the Listing Manual requires that interested persons must not vote on a shareholders' resolution approving any mandate in respect of any interested person transactions. Mr Lam Sing Chung and Mr Lin Kejian (being Interested Persons) will abstain, and shall procure that their respective associates abstain, from voting on the ordinary resolution relating to the proposed renewal of the IPT Mandate to be tabled at the 2025 AGM (Ordinary Resolution 10 in the Notice of Annual General Meeting), and the Company will disregard any votes cast by Mr Lam Sing Chung and Mr Lin Kejian (and their respective associates) in respect of their holdings of Shares on Ordinary Resolution 10.
