# Commitment and Approach

At Far East Holdings Berhad ("FEHB" or "the Group"), we are committed to delivering profitable and sustainable long-term growth to create value for all our stakeholders. In the year of review, we have increased our effort to protect and support the planet in various aspects including strengthening our sustainability approach in all material areas of our operations. We are aware that our daily operation impacts the environment and as such, we take conscious measures to enhance our management in all aspects.

The adoption of Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG") is the vital next step towards a sustainable future and responsible growth for the palm oil industry. We adopt ESG principles based on our industry's national standard - Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil ("MSPO"). The MSPO Standards contains seven (7) principles which form the general requirements of a management system framework, based on three (3) pillars of sustainability: economically viable, socially acceptable and

environmentally sound. The MSPO Certification establishes mandatory sustainability standards for oil palm plantations, both independent and organised smallholdings as well as palm oil processing facilities. It covers management requirements, specific performance requirements and traceability of production throughout the supply chain from raw materials to processing and manufacturing of palm oil and palm oil-based products. Despite business headwinds due to geo-strategic factors that we had encountered, we had been steadfast in maintaining our commitment for MSPO Standards and ESG adoption.

FEHB's Sustainability Statement has been reviewed internally by our internal auditors. Internal audit evaluates the company's internal controls, including its corporate governance and accounting processes. These types of audits ensure compliance with laws and regulations and help to maintain accurate and timely financial reporting and data collection. These audits also provide management with the tools necessary to attain operational efficiency by identifying problems and correcting lapses before they are discovered in the external audit.

# Economic

# Estates and Mills

Incorporated in 1973, FEHB has been established for fifty (50) years and is listed on Main Market of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad since 1991. The Group owns thirteen (13) oil palm estates across Pahang state. The reliance on local contractors and vendors, many of whom fall under the category of Small and Medium Sized Enterprise ("SME") is a vital part of the Group's daily field operation ensuring that the Group favorably contribute both direct and indirect economic impacts to the regional economic growth and development.

# Local Contractors

Local SME contractors based in Gugusan Felda Keratong, Bandar Muadzam Shah, Bandar Rompin and Felda Kemayan are heavily involved in daily field operation, such as harvesting works, transportation of Fresh Fruit Bunches ("FFBs") and other estate maintenance works such as manuring, weeding, pruning, road maintenance and drainage maintenance. These local contractors are hiring local workers, most of them from Gugusan Felda Keratong and the villages within the area such as Bandar Melati, Kampung Cenderawasih, Perantau Damai and Kota Bahagia to perform estate maintenance works. However, for the harvesting operations, the reliance on foreign workers mainly from Kepulauan Lombok, Indonesia remain significant.

In line with the commitment to support local contractors, FEHB provides interest-free loans and manages the acquisition of machinery from the best suppliers for its local contractors to support the Group's mechanisation initiatives. FEHB also disposes its machinery (tractors and trailers, mini crawlers, mechanical buffalo) to its local contractors at a price lower than its current market value to ensure that its local contractors have the capability to perform their contracted job. The Group also provides interest-free advances for its local contractors if they are unable to continue with their job due to shortage of capital.

# Local Vendors

The purchase of consumable agricultural equipment such as harvesting sickles, machetes, boots and others are being made from the local SME vendors mainly from Bandar Muadzam Shah and Gugusan Felda Keratong. The Group also purchased heavy machinery such as tractors, tipping trailers, rotary slashers and machineries such as mini crawler and mechanical buffalo (Timac) from local suppliers, mainly based in Pahang, Johor and Selangor.

Fertilisers are the Group's largest purchase. The Group mainly purchase Ammonium Sulphate, Muriate of Potash, Kieserite, Rock Phosphate and Borate based on the manuring program and formulation as set by the agronomists for all estates. While these fertilisers are being imported to Malaysia from its source country mainly China/Taiwan, Germany, Egypt/Jordan/Peru and Christmas Island, the purchases of these fertilisers are being made directly from Malaysian based importers to ensure the most competitive pricing.

# Corporate Sustainability Statement (Cont'd)

# Stakeholders Engagement

The Group proactively engages stakeholders since they are key enablers to our daily operation and core to our businesses. We are committed to apply inclusivity and responsiveness in our approach to a wide range of stakeholders and keep abreast of the issues material to them.

Throughout the year, FEHB actively engaged with six (6) key stakeholder groups. The detail are as follows:

# Corporate Sustainability Statement (Cont'd)

# Environmental

We are aware that our daily operations may affect the environmental and ecological systems in the area where we operate directly and indirectly, as well as those who rely on natural resources for their livelihood. In our effort to preserve the environment, we are committed to applying environmental sustainability and it is a critical part of FEHB's business strategy. At the heart of our approach is effective environmental management aligned to the Group's robust Sustainable Palm Oil ("SPO") Policy. The SPO Policy states the Group's commitment towards: -

- Adherence of environmental laws and regulations;  
- Prohibition of burning in all operations;  
- Conservation of the environment by mitigating the negative impacts and promoting the positive ones through systematic planning and procedures;  
- Providing training to all employees on environmental awareness and pollution prevention and taking on the responsibility to preserve the environment;  
- Maintenance of High Conservation Value ("HCV") Areas and protection of rare, threatened and endangered species that reside within HCV;  
- No new development on High Carbon Stock ("HCS") Forests;  
- No new development on peatland regardless of depth;  
- Application of Best Management Practices on existing plantation on peatland; and  
Co-operation with the communities, contractors, suppliers and government agencies to improve the environment.

# Biodiversity. HCV Areas and River Buffer Zones

HCV is an area that is either rich in biodiversity and/or home to endangered species of plants and animals; or that are fundamental to the needs of local communities to preserving their cultural identity. It is a requirement to identify and preserve the areas within our estates in line with MSPO Standards. We conserve biodiversity by establishing protected buffer zones along riverbanks to serve as wildlife passageways throughout our oil palm estates. These buffer zones also serve as a sanctuary and natural habitat for many migratory birds, reptiles and other animals.

![](images/0be1f7a7bb6f61bdbbdb03e1da3b322a498c5b1b71b0b1b2c187ef2fdc5012d2.jpg)

![](images/dab5eb43cff36060c55bedc15eb3132fc9104b0c9b84ebeb88fadc5f599c62dc.jpg)

As stated in our Slope & River Protection Policy, the river buffer zones should be maintained on both sides of the riverbank in line with the river's width. Even though we had completed replanting for 179.28 hectares in Cempaka Estate, the river buffer zones in the replanting areas remain untouched. The river buffer zones in other estates are also being properly preserved by the estate management. The signboards detailing

the species of animals are being installed and the estates' personnel frequently monitor the areas. An area of 121.41 hectare at Sungai Sawak Estate had been declared as preservation area, aligned with FEHB's commitment towards the preservation of HCV areas.

# Zero-Burning

The Group adheres steadfastly to its stringent Zero Burning Policy and remains resolute in implementing systems and initiatives to eliminate the occurrence of fires within its landholdings in accordance with its robust SPO Policy. To ensure that no involvement of fire and to improve soil erosion, the palm oil trunks are chipped along with the fronds and stacked in the field during replanting process.

# Corporate Sustainability Statement (Cont'd)

# Deforestation

FEHB is committed to ensuring that our operation throughout our whole supply chain does not involve deforestation. The Group closely monitors all its FFB suppliers to ensure that no FFB processed at our mills has a contribution towards deforestation. The Environmental Impact Assessment ("EIA") is performed before commencing any new plantation development activities. The last EIA was performed in Sungai Sawak Estate whose approval conditions required adoption of good practices and guidelines with regards to river buffer zones, air quality, water management and forest conservation areas.

# Peatland

The Group is committed to forbid all new development on peatland areas and this commitment includes all levels of our supply chains. For existing planted peatland areas namely Delima Estate, Rangkaian Estate and Sungai Sawak Estate, the Group applies the best management practices with the focus given to proper water table management to ensure the prevention of peatland fires, accelerated degradation of soil and subsidence of soil.

# Soil Management

In accordance with FEHB's Slope & River Protection Policy, we plant leguminous cover crops like Mucuna Bracteata, Calopogonium Mucunoides and Calopogonium Caeruleum on areas with slope higher than seven (7) degrees. This is to improve soil properties, reduce carbon dioxide emissions, reduce soil erosion on slopes and improve our soil quality through natural soil fertilisation and aeration process. The Mucuna Bracteata is an Indian leguminous plant which is widely being planted by oil palm plantation companies across the country. Its rapid growth also helps to prevent weed growth, reducing weeding cost for immature areas.

![](images/f914e39098921a6c03792f34db2ee0fcf63d7aa793d53df4a0acaacd8fb7702b.jpg)

The Group is committed to exempt any plantation development for areas with a slope higher than 25 degrees, which is also stated in FEHB's Slope & River Protection Policy.

# Mechanisation

The Group had increased the application of mechanisation in plantation operations, specifically in the areas of in-field collection, fertiliser application and seedling transfer, mainly to address the shortage of labour and reducing the dependency on manual work. We have been able to evacuate FFBs more efficiently in larger quantities and with reduced damage to the fruits, thus increasing productivity of the workers by deploying mini crawler and mechanical buffalo across the estates. Higher productivity levels of our workers lead to higher potential earnings. Although the fuel and operating costs of mini crawler and mechanical buffalo are higher, they are offset by lower labour costs and improved yields.

# Corporate Sustainability Statement (Cont'd)

# Scheduled Waste Management

The secure and effective management of Scheduled Waste is of paramount importance to ensure compliance with regulations and to safeguard the health of both human populations and the natural environment. At FEHB, we take great care to ensure that all Scheduled Waste produced by our derivatives are collected and disposed of in accordance with the guidelines and regulations set forth by the Malaysia Department of Environment ("DOE"), which include the Malaysia Environmental Quality (Scheduled Waste) Regulations 2005 (Amendment) 2007. The Group engages the services of licensed contractors registered with the DOE to ensure that the transportation and disposal of Scheduled Wasted in a proper and safe manner and to ensure compliance with the regulations.

# Renewable Energy

The Group actively integrates renewable energy sources such as solar power whenever feasible although our business relies mostly on diesel and petrol as a fuel for daily operations. In 2023, FEHB had installed 38 units of solar lamp powered by solar photovoltaic panel across the estates with a cost of RM77,508 to assist the daily operation of the estates. We are also applying the usage of battery powered mechanical buffalo for our in-field collection as a part of our mechanisation initiative.

# Energy Consumption

The Group closely monitors the consumption of energy (diesel and electricity) across the estates on a monthly basis. The fuel consumptions of the estate's machinery are being tracked and analysed on a day-to-day basis, allowing for proactive management of operational expenses, inventory maintenance and resource consumption. The management also applies the strategy of maximising the load capacity of its internal and external transports by utilising the available space in each transport. Throughout this strategy, the number of trips required has been reduced, resulting in lower consumption of diesel.

For 2023, the Monthly Diesel Consumption and Monthly Electricity Consumption are as follows:-

![](images/7f0e093b5502013b65dc16c489eb2bd31493b9297ee2691751f23ebf1804594f.jpg)  
Diesel Consumption

The increase in diesel consumption in 2023 compared to the previous year is due to the Group had increased the application of mechanisation in our plantation operations to address the shortage of labour and reducing the dependency on manual work.

# Emission Management

Reduction of carbon footprint to slow down climate change is a part of the Group's corporate responsibility to preserve the environment. To reduce the Greenhouse Gases ("GHG") emissions, the Group had placed a range of strategies including implementing nature-based solutions, executing forest rehabilitation and conservation activities and minimise operational GHG emissions. The efforts encompass various operational aspects across the estates and palm oil mills.

The Group continuously monitors the GHG emissions from the operation of estates based on the approved calculation method. Emission may be arising from the processing of FFB by the estates, precisely: -

a. Emission related to diesel consumption by an agricultural machinery;

* Note: Emission unit - kg CO2 per ha per year

To reduce the application of pesticides, we plant Turnera Subulata, Cassia Cobanensis, Euphorbia Heterophylla and Antigonon Leptopus to control bagworm. These types of plants produce flowers that attract parasitoid such as Sycanus Dichotomus, Dolichogenidea Metesae, Psytalia and Diachasmimorpha which is a natural predator for bagworm, thus reducing the GHG emissions resulting from pesticides application.

# Water Management

Efficient management of our water consumption is a high priority since the operation of the estates require a significant amount of water. By doing so, we exercise good agricultural practice and reduce operational cost. FEHB's estates are surrounded by natural water streams such as rivers and thus, it is our responsibility to prevent our operations from damaging these waterways.

At our plantations, we obtained water from municipal water sources, harvested rainwater and treated surface water from water resources such as lakes and rivers as well as from bore wells constructed near our operations. We perform rainwater

harvesting by digging weirs and pits to collect rainwater to provide the trees with resources over a longer period at our plantations. Harvested rainwater is utilised to manage water tables at peatland.

Since our estates share rivers with local communities, it is our responsibility to prevent contamination of the river due to effluent and water discharge from our operations. Water sampling is conducted in these areas by external laboratories and the results are reported to DOE. As for 2023, there are no instances of water contamination in rivers and lakes surrounding our operations. The Group water consumption for the year 2023 is 1.642166 Megaliters.

# Foreign Workers

Foreign workers are the most critical factor for most players in the Malaysian oil palm plantation industry. The Group continuously strive to ensure that the recruitment of foreign workers is being made in accordance with the Malaysian law and approved by the Malaysian authorities and source countries to avoid exploitation and modern slavery. We are committed to ensuring that their legal rights are fully safeguarded.

At FEHB, foreign workers make up  $96\%$  of our total estate workforce with the majority of them originating from Lombok, Indonesia. This island is well known for producing skilled harvesters for tall palm oil trees (above 20 years). The recruitment process begins with the issuance of hiring quota by Department of Labour, Ministry of Home Affairs. Our licensed agents will begin the recruitment process and clearing immigration procures, including the arrangement of transportation. The foreign workers will be picked up by our representative in Malaysia, then sending them to the respective estates. All cost involved are being absorbed by FEHB including levy fees payable to Malaysian Government, visa application, medical check-up and transportation cost.

In accordance with Workers' Minimum Standards of Housing and Amenities (Amendments) Act 2019 (Act 446), the foreign workers are provided with safe and secure on-site living facilities upon their arrival at the estates. The environment is very comfortable for our foreign workers and their dependents to work and live in. The accommodations such as houses, clean water and electricity supplies, internet access, healthcare, surau, childcare facilities, recreational and sport facilities are available for foreign workers at the estate. The estate management also provides 24 hours security to safeguard foreign workers' belongings and dependents during their time at work.

The Group had implemented the following methods to ensure the fair treatment of foreign workers: -

Passports and other forms of personal identification remain in the possession of the foreign workers;  
- Wages are in accordance with Employment Act 1955 and Minimum Wage Order 2022;  
- Working hours and overtime adhere to Employment Act 1955;  
- Equal pay for equal work policy, ensuring that foreign workers receive fair remuneration compared to local workers; and  
- Foreign workers are free to practice their religious beliefs.

# Occupational Safety and Health

# Safety and Health Policy

The Group stated its commitment to the compliance of Occupational Safety and Health Act 1994 in accordance with our sustainability principles through the establishment of our Safety and Health Policy. Our Safety and Health Policy states that the Group will: -

- Comply with current legal law and other relevant requirements, regulations, certified codes of practice, national standards and guidelines on Occupational Safety and Health;  
- Establish Occupational Safety and Health Management System in all operating units;  
- Formulating, creating, delivering, implementing and maintaining a safe work system in workplace;  
Providing adequate education, training and experience to all employees to enable them to perform their duties efficiently and effectively; and

Whenever there are any changes in process, work activities, new equipment, findings from any incident including near miss incidents and findings from workplace inspection reported by safety committee members, it is required to review the risk assessment and risk mitigation.

There are 28 types of hazardous work recorded based on FEHB's HIRARC for the year 2023. The mitigation plan to prevent accidents from happening is by providing adequate safety training to ensure employees are given exposure and awareness of occupational safety and health.

# Corporate Sustainability Statement (Cont'd)

# Chemical Health Risk Assessment ("CHRA")

The Group had appointed a Competent Assessor registered with the Department of Occupational Safety and Health ("DOSH") to carry out CHRA, identifying all health risks that may arise due to the usage of hazardous chemical at workplace. The Competent Assessor shall recommend control measures to mitigate the severity of the effect of hazardous chemical used. In accordance with Occupational Safety and Health Act (Use and Standard of Exposure Chemical Hazardous to Health Regulation 2000), the Competent Assessor will conduct the CHRA once every five (5) years.

# Safety Training

Safety awareness training conducted by safety personnel is compulsory for new employees before they start their work. Emergency Response Team ("ERT") members are trained by Jabatan Bomba dan Penyelamat Malaysia to enhance their safety skills.

# Lost Time Injury Rate ("LTIR")

A LTIR is an injury sustained on the job that results in the loss of productive work time. An occupational injury is considered a LTIR only when the injured worker: -

- Unable to perform regular duties.  
Requires time off to recover.  
- Assigned modified work duties while recovering.

A LTIR is also known as a lost time incident or lost time case. Measurement of LTIR was conducted to ensure performance of safety and health were monitored as well as to evaluate any potential risk that will lead to injury.

FEHB is committed to standing together to make a world of difference for autistic people as a part of the Group&#x27;s inclusivity approach.</td><td>50,000</td></tr></table>

# Diversity and Gender Equality

Diversity is the strength of our workforce, reflecting the communities in which we operate. We have access to a wealth of perspectives, capabilities and experiences by employing people from diverse backgrounds which helps to ensure we have the best insights into the evolving needs of customers and stakeholders. To inculcate a non-discriminatory and harmonised work culture, all our people are expected to respect each other's culture. Discrimination, harassment and any form of unfair treatment are strictly prohibited.

The Group's stance on Gender Equality stating our commitment to: -

- Strive to prevent any sexual harassment and other forms of violence against women, workers and the community;  
- Creating specific procedures and mechanism accepted by all parties in dealing with complaints and grievances on gender-related issues;  
- Provide adequate training and development to increase the awareness, skills and understanding of employees;  
- Provide and create an opportunity to develop women's leadership at all levels; and  
- Ensure effective participation of women in the decision-making process by encouraging them to participate in existing committees such as the Occupational Safety and Health Committee.

Lower female representation was observed in our plantation operation and this disparity is attributable to the nature of the work. The operation of estate including harvesting, transportation and estate maintenance works involves manual labour and physical task that are often perceived as more suitable for male workers. Achieving gender parity can only be effectively addressed by challenging stereotypes about job suitability based on gender and therefore requires ongoing efforts. This becomes a part of our objective to create a workplace that encourages and supports the career development and participation of female employees in all areas of our operations.

Far East Holdings Berhad ("FEHB" or "the Group") is pleased to present our Management Discussion and Analysis for the financial year ended 31 December 2023 (FY2023). This report outlines our efforts in realising our economic, environmental and social goals as our business and operations set down the path of sustainable growth now and in the future.

# Overview of Business and Operations

FEHB is principally engaged in cultivation of oil palms, production and sales of fresh fruit bunches ("FFB"), crude palm oil ("CPO"), palm kernel ("PK") and investment holdings.

We remain as a cultivator of oil palm and operator of palm oil mill producing FFB, CPO and PK respectively. As a progressive player in the plantation industry, we are committed to enhance our stakeholders' value as we continue to yield high quality products and services underpinned by a conducive working environment and continuous engagement with the local community.

# Area statement

The Group has thirteen (13) estates across Pahang State namely Bukit Jin Estate, Chengal Estate, Sungai Rasau Estate, Sungai Seraya Estate, Sungai Batu Estate, DSK Estate, Cenderawasih Estate, Sungai Sawak Estate, Bukit Serok Estate, Dawn Estate, Cempaka Estate, Delima Estate and Rangkaian Estate.

# Management Discussion and Analysis (Cont'd)

Our Group places paramount emphasis on implementing best agricultural practices across all its estates. All of our estates have obtained the Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil ("MSPO") certification, whilst five (5) estates have obtained International Sustainability Carbon Certificate ("ISCC") certification during the financial year under review giving a competitive advantage to the Group to obtain premium prices for CPO and PK and elevate our brand while strengthening trust from the Group's customers. This is also an acknowledgement of our Group's adherence to good economic, environmental and social standards in the production of sustainable palm oil.

# FFB Production

As at 31 December 2023, the total FFB production for the Group in the reporting year was 292,663MT against 327,769MT in year 2022. The following is the FFB production on quarterly basis for the year under review against preceding year:

<table><tr><td>Quarter</td><td>2023 (MT)</td><td>2022 (MT)</td></tr><tr><td>Jan - Mar</td><td>61,693</td><td>60,682</td></tr><tr><td>Apr - Jun</td><td>53,529</td><td>69,195</td></tr><tr><td>Jul - Sept</td><td>82,586</td><td>100,400</td></tr><tr><td>Oct - Dec</td><td>94,855</td><td>97,492</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>292,663</td><td>327,769</td></tr></table>

Most of the estates in FEHB Group achieved a very good yield in 2022. As a result, many estates experienced very low yields in the first half of 2023 as palms were recovering from the high yields produced in 2022. Yields in most estates only started improving in the second half year. However, heavy rainfall in December 2023 had to some extent affected crop recovery in that month.

The Group recorded higher FFB yield which was 16.31MT per hectare compared to average yield in Pahang State and Peninsular Malaysia in 2023 of 15.22MT per hectare and 16.09MT per hectare respectively.

The Group traded its CPO using the average price mechanism set by Malaysian Palm Oil Board ("MPOB"). In FY2023, CPO and PK were realised at an average price of RM3,802 per MT and RM2,018 per MT respectively (FY2022: Average CPO price of RM4,897 per MT and average PK price of RM2,953 per MT). Both CPO and PK recorded a decrease in average prices by  $22\%$  and  $32\%$  respectively as compared to previous year. Lower CPO and PK prices in FY2023 were mainly due to higher output, increasing inventory and change in the economic conditions of other oil crops.

# Group Financial Review

# Revenue

In FY2023, the Group's revenue was RM542.36 million, a decrease of  $31\%$ , compared to RM785.66 million registered in FY2022.

In FY2023, the Group's revenue had reduced when compared to FY2022 due to:

(a) Lower average CPO and PK prices by  $22\%$  and  $32\%$  respectively. The average CPO price per MT was RM3,802 (2022: RM4,897) and average PK price per MT was RM2,018 (2022: RM2,953);  
(b) Lower production of FFB by 35,106MT (11%); and  
(c) Lower FFB processed from milling operations by 15,705MT (3%).

# Profit Before Tax

The Group posted a profit before tax of RM129.46 million for the year ended 31 December 2023, lower by RM145.23 million (53%) when compared to the preceding year 2022 which was RM274.69 million mainly due to:-

(a) Lower average CPO and PK prices by  $22\%$  and  $32\%$  respectively;  
(b) Lower share of profit after tax from associates by RM46.80 million (50%); and  
(c) Lower FFB production by 35,106MT (11%).

# Management Discussion and Analysis (Cont'd)

# Plantation Operations

In FY2023, the Group's operation continued to face challenges from lower commodities prices after experiencing unprecedented high levels in FY2022. This price volatility arose from the changing global landscape amongst others the subsided impact of the Russia-Ukraine war and the lifting of export ban of palm oil by Indonesia from April to May 2023 which had pushed down the CPO price substantially in FY 2023.

After having a period of labour shortages due to COVID-19, overall labour situation had improved significantly and the Group managed to recruit 591 new foreign workers as compared to only 153 in FY2022. As at the year-end the number of foreign workers, based on net movement, was  $70\%$  higher than beginning of the year.

Amidst these challenges, our Group managed to achieve a satisfactory performance in FY2023.

Plantation is the core business of the Group which engages in the cultivation of oil palm and processing of palm oil, with operations in nursery, cultivation and crop oil extraction. Key results indicators for plantation are as below: -

<table><tr><td></td><td>Unit</td><td>2023</td><td>2022</td></tr><tr><td>FFB Production</td><td>MT</td><td>292,663</td><td>327,769</td></tr><tr><td>CPO Production</td><td>MT</td><td>55,670</td><td>61,598</td></tr><tr><td>FFB Yield</td><td>MT/ha</td><td>16.31</td><td>18.69</td></tr><tr><td>CPO Yield</td><td>MT/ha</td><td>3.10</td><td>3.51</td></tr><tr><td>Average OER for CPO</td><td>%</td><td>19.02</td><td>18.79</td></tr><tr><td>Average CPO Price</td><td>RM/MT</td><td>3,802</td><td>4,897</td></tr><tr><td>Average PK Price</td><td>RM/MT</td><td>2,018</td><td>2,953</td></tr><tr><td>Mature Area</td><td>Hectare</td><td>17,939</td><td>17,536</td></tr><tr><td>Total Planted Area</td><td>Hectare</td><td>18,898</td><td>18,909</td></tr></table>

In FY2023, the average cost of FFB for the Group is recorded at RM326 per MT,  $14\%$  higher compared to the previous year of RM286 per MT, mainly due to recruitment expenses for foreign workers and higher wages in FY2023. The Group closely monitor the operating expenses at estates level as part of the cost control initiatives. In terms of operational efficiency, the Group managed to achieve average OER for CPO at  $19.02\%$ .

The estates continue to be monitored by qualified agronomists and planting advisors in order to ensure best practices for sustainable agriculture are being applied to produce good quality palms and fruits. Various analysis and studies are carried out on oil palm and the nutrient status, palm appearance, ground conditions, pest and disease affecting the palms and pruning method. Recommendations by our qualified agronomists ensure the best fertiliser programs are applied at estates.

# Replanting

Concerted efforts are continuously made by the management to enhance the replanting activities based on our strong commitment towards enforcing sustainable practices. These developments remain of cardinal importance in terms of our Group's ability to further improve our agronomic productivities.

In FY2023, 179.30 hectares (443.05 acres) had been replanted and this reflects our continuous efforts to improve the age profile of our plantings and achieve better yields. In the year 2024-2028, 993.92 hectares (2,455.98 acres) are scheduled for replanting.

# Management Discussion and Analysis (Cont'd)

# Milling Operations

Milling is a crucial part of the Group's operation which accounted for  $74\%$  of the Group's revenue for FY2023. The Group operates two (2) palm oil mills, namely Kilang Kosfarm Sdn. Bhd. ("KKSB") and Wujud Wawasan Sdn. Bhd. ("WWSB") with processing capacity of 60MT per hour for each mill. KKSB mill has obtained ISCC certification. The Group's revenue from milling operations is RM403.63 million,  $32\%$  lower when compared to FY2022 (RM595.02 million) which was mainly due to lower CPO and PK prices.

KKSB and WWSB recorded a total of 437,850MT FFB processed which is a slight decrease of  $3\%$  (15,705MT) in FY2023 (FY2022: 453,555MT). The production capacity of both mills remains at 60MT per hour (FY2022: 60MT per hour). The average OER for CPO and PK achieved by both mills for FY2023 are  $20.17\%$  and  $5.27\%$  respectively (FY2022: CPO OER  $19.62\%$ , PK OER  $5.42\%$ ).

The mills supplied CPO to one of the Group's associates i.e. Future Prelude Sdn. Bhd. ("FPSB"), which is an integrated palm oil refinery and oleochemical company specialising in the production of several refined palm oil and oleochemical products as well as biodiesel using sustainable palm oil as feedstock. FPSB produces Refined Bleached and Deodorised Palm Oil ("RBD PO"), Refined Bleached and Deodorised Palm Kernel Oil ("RBD PKO"), Palm Methyl Ester ("PME" or "Biodiesel"), Glycerine ("Tech Grade"), Glycerine ("Pharmaceutical Grade"), Palm Fatty Acid Distillate ("PFAD"), using sustainable Crude Palm Oil ("CPO") or Crude Palm Kernel Oil ("CPKO") as feedstock.

# Capital Structure

The Group has always maintained a conservative policy in respect of its cash and cash equivalents by ensuring minimum external borrowings are needed to finance capital expenditure and expansion of estates land and mill. Cash and cash equivalents stood at RM205.50 million as at 31 December 2023 (2022: RM244.15 million).

This approach has served the Group well and will ensure that we can utilise internal funds for replanting and other capital expenditure and at the same time to sustain a stable dividend to shareholders.

# Capital Expenditure

During the year under review, the Group spent a total of RM16.27 million in capital expenditure as compared to RM16.52 million in FY2022. The capital expenditure incurred was mainly on replanting, upgrading of mills, constructions of staff and labour quarters, facilities in compliance of MSPO and ISCC certifications and purchase of agricultural equipment and vehicles. All capital expenditures were funded by internally generated funds.

# Acquisition of the mill

On 28 February 2024, FEHB had entered into a Share Sale and Purchase Agreement ("SSA") with Endau Palm Oil Mill Sdn. Bhd. ("EPOM"), Rangkaian Delima Plantation Sdn. Bhd. ("RDPSB") and Insan Se Jagat Sdn. Bhd. ("ISSB") to acquire  $100\%$  equity interest in Merchong Palm Oil Mill Sdn. Bhd. ("MPOM") for consideration of RM10 million.

MPOM is a private limited company, incorporated on 9 April 2014. The principal activity of MPOM is operating a palm oil mill with a processing capacity of 60MT per hour. The mill was commissioned in October 2019 and is located at Tebu Hitam, Mukim Rompin, Daerah Rompin, Pahang; on a land subleased from F.E. Rangkaian Sdn. Bhd., a subsidiary of FEHB, at RM8,000 per month for a period of 30 years commencing from 21 April 2016.

Currently the Sungai Sawak Estate, Delima Estate and Rangkaian Estate in FEHB Group sell their FFB to MPOM averaging 3,500MT - 6,000MT per month.

# Human Capital

The Group strongly believes in empowering workers through proper training as it is the critical component for sustaining a productive and environmentally conscious workforce. Skilled employees and experienced management team are our greatest assets. We remain committed to investing in human capital development to produce a team of high-calibre employees to support FEHB's growth.

Over the years, FEHB has focused on talent investment, training, leadership development and career planning initiatives to maintain a good quality pool of in-house talents within the Group. RM136,541 was spent for various training and development programmes.

We are focused on supporting our employees throughout their professional lives by implementing training and development programmes, as well as promoting values that engender positive working culture and work-life balance. Our operating units ensure continuous talent enrichment process by listening to their staff needs, and valuing their skills and contributions with fair remuneration and succession-planning initiatives.

In FY2023, the Group reached a total headcount of 273 people made up primarily of employees in estates who represent  $57\%$  (155 personnel) of Group's employees. The number of foreign workers had increased from 554 in FY2022 to 943 in FY2023.

The Group's human capital policy calls for fair and equal opportunities where the remuneration policy strives to be competitive and rewarding performance without discrimination of any form. In support of national initiatives, the Group complies with the national minimum wage requirement.

We constantly review our employee value proposition to ensure it leads industry standards in attracting talent and building workplace loyalty. Through engagements and strategic partnership with higher education institutions nationwide, we reach out to new talent and promote the Group as an employer of choice that offers good career progression as well as productive work culture and workplace environment.

# Creating Value for Shareholders

Despite the challenging environment that we operated in the past year, the Group remains committed to reward our shareholders with continuous returns in the form of dividends, whilst simultaneously recognising the needs to maintain sufficient reserves to support our Group's future growth objectives.

Weighing all the factors such as the funding needed for capital expenditure, future growth as well as operational requirements, the Board had declared an interim dividend of five (5) sen per ordinary share in respect of the 2023 financial year. The interim single tier dividend was paid on 10 January 2024.

The Directors had also recommended the payment of a final single tier dividend of six (6) sen per ordinary share and the proposed payment date is on 5 July 2024. The total dividends declared in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2023 (if approved by the shareholders at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting) is eleven (11) sen per ordinary share.

# Prospect

Looking ahead the Group will continue to focus on increasing yields and productivity. Emphasis will continue to be given to improve the agriculture conditions to unlock the full potential of our yields. All factors affecting yield are being thoroughly analysed and reviewed by our agronomists including to improve our canopy management, agronomic inputs, manuring regime and vegetative covers as well as to achieve  $100\%$  crop recovery by harvesting very tall palms, better loose fruit collection and improvement of supervision. In respect of replanting areas, we will continue to implement sound agriculture practices to ensure best yields are obtained. These include applying recommended replanting procedure by agronomist on infected field and monitoring the pest control activities from the early stages.

In addition, our Group has been proactively adopting new technologies for better agronomic management. The use of drones have augmented the monitoring and surveillance capabilities in the field, allowing more effective monitoring of estate conditions as well as rapid detection of hotspots and floods. Drone technology has also been employed for palm census and land mapping activities across our operations.

Year 2024 will continue to be a challenging year to the Group. The current trend in average selling prices of CPO is expected to persist. The weather pattern anticipated to move towards El-Nino may impact production and CPO prices. The Group also needs to remain vigilant against pressures on our cost base due to high operations costs and higher wages.

With these uncertainties, the Group is still positive to be able to generate satisfactory results for the year ending 31 December 2024.

# RESPONSIBILITIES AND ACCOUNTABILITIES

# Board of Directors

The Group is led by the Board. The Board affirms its overall responsibility for the Group's system of internal control, including the assurance of its adequacy and integrity, and its alignment with business objectives. The Board is committed to maintaining a sound system of internal control to safeguard shareholders' investment and the Group's assets and to review its adequacy and integrity periodically. The system of internal control covers a broad spectrum of end to end business processes encompassing both the financial and non-financial risks.

The Board also recognises that a sound system of internal control can only mitigate risks, but acknowledges its limitations in eliminating the possibility of poor judgement in decision making, human error, control process being deliberately circumvented by employees, management overriding controls and the occurrence of unforeseeable circumstances. Accordingly, the system could provide only reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement, operational failures, fraud or loss.

The Internal Audit Function adopts a risk-based approach and is independent of the activities they audit. Their work is based on an annual audit plan approved by the Audit Committee. In order to ensure independence, the Head of Internal Audit reports directly to the Audit Committee. Audit Committee meetings are convened once every quarter or as and when required.

# Risk Management and Environmental, Social & Governance Committee

Risk Management and Environmental, Social & Governance Committee has been separately formed as Board Committee. The primary objective of the Risk Management and Environmental, Social & Governance Committee is to assist the Board in discharging its statutory and fiduciary responsibilities by identifying significant risks and ensuring that the Group Risk Management Framework incorporates the necessary policies and mechanisms to manage the overall risk exposures of the Group. The Committee is also responsible to oversee the Group's Sustainability or interchangeably, environmental, social and governance related framework, strategy, external commitments, policies and practices as well as performances against relevant benchmarks such as external Environmental, Social & Governance rating or assessments.

The Risk Management and Environmental, Social & Governance Committee comprises majority Non-Executive Directors. The composition of the Committee during the period under review including the appointment of Mr Tan Keh Feng, who is a non-director had been made in accordance with the Terms of Reference. The biography of members of the Risk Management and Environmental, Social & Governance Committee is set out in the Directors' Profile section. During the financial year ended 31 December 2023, the Risk Management and Environmental, Social & Governance Committee held a total of two (2) meetings.

# Risk Management Framework and Internal Control

The Board with the assistance of the Risk Management and Environmental, Social & Governance Committee and management undertook to identify the principal business risks in the critical areas of the Group. This involved assessing the likelihood of material exposures and identifying the appropriate safeguards to be taken and the required time frame to mitigate and minimise the impact of these risks. This was done through discussion and meetings at estates and senior management levels. The results of updated risks profiles were further deliberated by the Risk Management and Environmental, Social & Governance Committee prior to escalation to the Board.

The top six (6) business risks that were rated as Significant and Medium are as follows:-

<table><tr><td>No.</td><td>Risk</td><td>Risk Likelihood</td><td>Impact</td></tr><tr><td>1.</td><td>Unfavorable Weather Condition</td><td>Significant</td><td>High</td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>Over-Dependence on Foreign Workers</td><td>Significant</td><td>High</td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td>Yield Determining Factor in Oil Palm</td><td>Medium</td><td>Moderate</td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td>Fluctuation of Crude Palm Oil Prices</td><td>Medium</td><td>Moderate</td></tr><tr><td>5.</td><td>Environment, Social &amp; Governance</td><td>Medium</td><td>Moderate</td></tr><tr><td>6.</td><td>Factors Contributing to Oil Losses in Crude Palm Oil</td><td>Medium</td><td>Moderate</td></tr></table>

The details of principal risks reviewed and strategies adopted by the Board to mitigate the impact of the risks are as follows:-

# (1) Unfavourable Weather Condition

The weather has a significant impact on palm oil production. Heavy rains and flooding in key palm oil growing regions have caused delays and disruptions to the harvesting and transportation of the crop. This is expected to lead to lower production numbers in the coming months. In addition, drought conditions in other areas have also impacted production. At the beginning of 2023 (i.e.: in February and March), several of the Group's areas were flooded. For all the affected estates, harvesting works were disrupted and affected the production of Fresh Fruit Bunches ("FFB").

To mitigate the impacts, the Group has carried out initiatives by desilting of drains and construction of new drains, maintaining the culverts, installed drainage blocks, construction of bunds in low lying or flood prone areas and construction of bridges for better access routes. The roads have been maintained in good condition to ensure that all roads are passable and no disruption on transportation of FFB.

Apart from that, palm oil producers including FEHB have experienced a range from weak to moderate El-Nino starting June 2023 to October 2023 with a low rainfall and temperature increase between 0.5 degree Celsius to 1.0 degree Celsius. As a results, the weight of harvested FFB decreased between  $10\%$  to  $30\%$  after the hottest months and had affected the high crop season from July 2023 to September 2023. El-Nino will worsen the impact of under-fertilisation and threatens to decrease yields. El-Nino is unlikely to affect production this year as it takes about 15 to 18 months for the impact to materialise.

To manage the impact, the Group has carried out an initiative at all the estates by ensuring timely application of fertiliser as well as utilisation of Empty Fruit Bunches ("EFB") to reduce moisture loss.

# (2) Over-Dependence on Foreign Worker

The Government has approved 995,396 foreign workers' employment permits for employers in manufacturing sector at 387,122 permits, construction sector at 342,106 permits, service sector at 143,568 permits, plantation sector at 76,325 permits, agriculture sector at 45,899 permits and mining and quarrying sector at 376 permits.

Starting in March 2023, the Government decided to postpone the application and approval of the foreign workers quota including through the Foreign Worker Employment Relaxation Plan ("FWERP") until further notice. This is to ensure that employers who have been granted quota approval will start making plans for the immediate entry of the required foreign workers.

# (2) Over-Dependence on Foreign Workers

FEHB has managed to obtain 1,104 quotas before the Government froze the new quota application. As at 31 December 2023, a total of 884 Indonesian workers and 120 Bangladesh workers have been recruited. Statistics of harvesters and ratio for FEHB's estates are shown below: -

![](images/f10a71b0535f42f73eb84aa796285302da15cfd8bc5e232ec7d080f5f79c8dc4.jpg)  
Harvesters

FEHB has initiated the following strategies to optimise the productivity as well as to retain the workers:-

(a) Maximise the usage of semi-mechanisation in-fields fruits collection;  
(b) Gradually replacing all the non-critical jobs or tasks to local workers such as loose fruit collectors, line sweeper and cleaner;  
(c) To bear the cost of extending the work permit for workers in Year 10 and for two additional years (Year 11 and Year 12); and  
(d) Creating incentive scheme to reward workers based upon operation-oriented performances and renewal of their permit with Immigration Department of Malaysia.

# (3) Yield Determining Factors in Oil Palm

# Seedling Material

High quality seedlings are an important starting point for the successful establishment of plantation in ensuring early fruiting and desired yields. The normal recommended seedlings plant in field ranges from 12 to 14 months. To ensure quality and purity of seedlings, FEHB has purchased the seedlings from trusted suppliers and licensed by MPOB.

Culling process must be carried out during the nursery stage to ensure that only the best seedlings to be planted in the fields and able to withstand the transplanting shock. Seedlings chosen will affect the production yield over the lifespan of palm oil tree of up to 25 years. Abnormal seedlings must be culled as retaining them will only result in wastage of cost and an expected yield could not be derived.

Untrained nursery operators may lead to improper nursery management which will potentially affect the quality of the seedlings. FEHB participated in the Code of Practice for Oil Palm Nursery ("CoPN") program whereby the assessment has been carried out every year by MPOB. CoPN program provides guidelines to nursery operators for producing high quality of oil palm seedlings as well as providing technical knowledge, best practices in nursery management and new technologies be used in oil palm nursery operations.

(3) Yield Determining Factors in Oil Palm (Cont'd)

# Pruning

The organisation of oil palm leaves needs to have the youngest leaves appear on the top while the older ones at the bottom. About two leaves appear per month and it grows in spirals of eight on palm trees. The unproductive fronds which are dead and drying fronds should be discarded. Pruning is required in order to keep an optimum number of leaves on the palms. More fronds on palms are better as it can capture more sunlight and produce more fruit bunches. The palms without performing fronds pruning or excessive pruning of fronds would result to lesser and lighter bunches.

The Group mitigation strategy is to ensure that there is sufficient manpower for the pruning work. With the stable workforce in place, the Group successfully completed its pruning program in 2023.

# Fertiliser Management

Efficient plant cultivation is secured with a sufficient supply of macro and micronutrients, including nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus and magnesium. With a lack of nutrients, adequate growing is impossible. The fertiliser requirements differ depending on the palms age profile, with bigger amounts for mature areas.

To mitigate the risk, the Group has applied fertilisers as per recommendation given by the Agronomist, to monitor application of each fertiliser according to the schedule, to ensure proper application and continuously identifies nutrient deficiency by conducting leaf sampling on yearly basis for the respective fields.

# Climate Change

Climate change that affects rainfall patterns and the earth's temperature has worsened in recent years. Abiotic stress caused by climate change is the main environmental factor that inhibits the yield of most crops. Various types of abiotic stress such as drought as well as high temperature and salinity cause disturbances in the water status that have adverse effects on plants.

Productivity of palm oil is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change resulting in extreme conditions either from drought (El-Nino) or floods. This includes a decreased on rate of female flower production and a reduction in fruit bunch size and weight. Abiotic stress can affect fruit development and post-harvest quality of oil palm fruit and this is important in terms of economic value to the industry.

While unfavourable weather condition is beyond our control, the Group remain proactive in mitigating their impact. This includes ensuring timely fertiliser application according to program and improving drainage system to reduce the impact of the climate change.

# Replanting

Palm oil yield declines with age after approximately 20 years. Thus, replanting aging oil palm in a timely manner is vital and necessary strategy for improving average yields that could enhance total palm oil production within existing areas, reducing pressures to expand development into sensitive and diminishing natural forest areas. Optimal replanting ages depend on various factors such as oil palm price, cost to establish new palms, availability of labour, period of time before new plantings can be harvested and capital costs associated with replanting.

Proper planning and analysis are crucial to mitigate the impact of tall or aging palms towards the yield. Maintaining stable and high levels of oil palm production within the current oil palm extent is a potential strategy to relieve deforestation pressure. Combining replanting with yield improvements could overcome potential declines in regional production.

# Replanting (Cont'd)

The Group has planned mitigation strategy by carrying out replanting program in-stages for the tall palms and low yield areas to ensure the production is sustainable. Replanting  $5\%$  annually, with or without yield improvement would achieve the most stable landscape-level production. With yield improvement, the Group's production could be increased to higher levels under any replanting rate. For the year under review, 179.30 hectares (443.05 acres) had been replanted and this reflects our continuous efforts to improve the age profile of our plantings and achieve better yields. The weighted average palm age is recorded at 13.48 years. In the year 2024 until 2028, 993.92 hectares (2,455.98 acres) are scheduled for replanting.

# Soil Management

Low yield was recorded in 2023 for Delima Estate and Sungai Sawak Estate at 10.14 mt/ha and 11.89 mt/ha respectively. Compared to other estates, both estates are categorised as peat soil estates, which present unique challenges. High water table with frequent flooding has resulted in lower yields due to a poor aeration of the palms rooting zone. This issue is closely related to climate change where high rainfall has resulted in the condition of the peat soil in the estates being constantly waterlogged and flooded when it rains.

To improve the estates' yield, the Group has implemented the Good Agricultural Practices by maintaining ground vegetation with natural covers which are not competitive for nutrients and water, proper fronds stacking to help reducing the run-off and soil erosion, construction of soil conservation (silt pit) and planting terrace, planning effective drainage and water management system including the right water control structures and ensuring adequate and timely fertilisers application by the estate management.

# (4) Fluctuation of Crude Palm Oil ("CPO") Prices

Despite the external factors influencing world's palm oil prices, the Malaysian palm oil industry had demonstrated resilience in the first half of 2023. The benchmark CPO price on Bursa Malaysia remained robust at RM3,900 per metric tonne average year-to-date 2023, demonstrating the industry's adeptness at navigating challenges, while maintaining its competitive edge.

On the supply-demand picture, there were rising supply risks on the horizon and demand remained lackluster. Palm oil stocks rose  $9.6\%$  month-on-month to 2.31 million tonnes in September, the highest level since October 2022 (2.41 million tonnes) due to lower exports and a seasonally higher cropping pattern.

# (4) Fluctuation of Crude Palm Oil ("CPO") Prices (Cont'd)

The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict had caused a surge palm oil demand as a substitute of sunflower oil. Another factor that supports the stability in prices is the resurgence of demand from India and China. Demand from India is expected to increase in the coming months, driven by the Diwali celebration in November 2023. In China, manufacturing activities have slowly increased although they remain below the expansion threshold of 50. As at August 2023, the Purchasing Managers' Index for China's manufacturing sector was at 49.7, which is a slight increase from July 2023 at 49.3.

Weather remains a key determinant factor for CPO yields, which will also impact the commodity's price in the international markets. Analysts are expecting that if El-Nino occurs, prices of CPO could climb higher. RHB Research foresees that the El-Nino phenomenon will be moderate this year. It is expected that CPO prices will range higher from current levels to RM4,000-RM4,500 per tonne once the impact of El-Nino starts to affect productivity in the second half of 2024.

Although the price of CPO fluctuates from time to time, the Group has established a mitigation plan to reduce the impact of CPO Price volatility through cost control mechanism, adjusting expenditure according to the budget estimate and programs to improve productivity.

# (5) Environmental, Social and Governance Risk ("ESG")

ESG issues have gained prominence in the business sector primarily driven by socially conscious and institutional investors demanding increased attention in these areas. This focus has increased in recent years as the ESG focus is seen as a way of mitigating risks and identifying new opportunities. It has become an important business consideration across industries, including the palm oil industry.

ESG attempts to reconcile the impact of economic activity with the inescapable and inconvenient truth that palm oil is crucial to us. Our growing world relies on vegetable oils including palm oil. So, if it is not manufactured, it must be grown.

# Continuous Focusing on Environmental

Biodiversity is one of the most significant environmental issues involving the agricultural sector. The Group has demonstrated its commitment to zero deforestation under the No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation ("NDPE") policies. One notable change is the introduction of a cut-off date for deforestation effective 31 December 2019. These updates reflect the Group's commitment to addressing environmental concerns and promoting sustainability within the palm oil industry. This is on par with the requirement of a deforestation-free commodities regulation recently approved by the European Union parliament.

In the context of legal obligations, the Group are required to comply with the Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (“MSPO”) standard. As the name implies, this standard ensures sustainable palm oil production in the country. In addition, the MSPO standard has recently been reviewed and revised by various non-governmental organisations such as the Worldwide Fund for Nature and palm oil growers and producers as well as the Academic Research on Palm Oil Sustainability Network. As a result of this collaborative effort, the revised MSPO standard has undergone significant changes.

The Group closely monitored its consumption of non-renewable energy baseline values arising from operations which the estates submitted on by monthly basis to ensure our usage of non-renewable energy meets our target. The Group also has started to use battery operated machineries to reduce the emission release from diesel tractors. Apart from that, the Group had installed solar lights at selected estates in order to save electricity consumption.

The organic content within Rome has been transferred into a nutrient-rich fertiliser, revolutionising sustainable agriculture. Not only does this approach reduce the need for chemical fertilisers, but it also presents a responsible solution in reducing waste and environmental impact, further impacting Scope 3 emissions. By ensuring that Rome is transformed into biogas, manufacturers indirectly address the Scope 2 of Scope 3 emissions associated with their palm oil supply chain. While the emissions from Rome are not directly offsetted by the Renewable Energy Certificates (REC), the act of transforming Rome into biogas mitigates these emissions at the source.

An area of 121.41 hectares (300.00 acres) at Sungai Sawak Estate had been declared as preservation area, aligned with FEHB's commitment towards the preservation of High Conservation Value (HCV) area.

# Approach Towards Sustainability

In terms of the social aspects, labour exploitation concerns such as forced labour, child labour, debt bondage, indigenous land rights as well as poor living and working conditions have been associated with the palm oil industry. As part of the NDPE policies, the Group is committed to respecting the rights of not only their workers but also indigenous people and local communities.

Nonetheless, society is not just about workers but also the surrounding community. In this context, it examines how the industry has improved people's quality of life. In a broader context, the Malaysian palm oil industry including FEHB has helped lift many people out of poverty including the Orang Asli community by providing more than 3 million direct and indirect employment opportunities and nearly 500,000 smallholders are involved in this industry.

# Growing Towards Governance

The governance aspect involves evaluating the efficiency of a company's management and its commitment to prioritising the welfare of its stakeholders. The Group has an advantage in this regard as it possesses experience in meeting auditing requirements, particularly through mandatory sustainability certification programs such as MSPO. These initiatives greatly contribute to better understanding and fulfilment of the governance aspect within the framework of ESG principles.

The Group are well-versed in the corporate governance aspects of its operations. This includes demonstrating management commitment and fulfilling responsibilities, as well as ensuring compliance with legal requirements, including upholding customary rights, conducting business ethically and adhering to anti-bribery practices. Additionally, we have established systems to address complaints and grievances promptly and transparently.

The Group has also planned a continuous improvement plan for ESG. Below are the projects that will be carried out:-

(a) Emphasise safety program and training for better understanding of safety in order to reduce accident at workplace;  
(b) Monitor closely the consumption of non-renewable energy baseline values to ensure the energy usage did not exceed the baseline values; and  
(c) Application of EFB to reduce consumption of non-renewable energy.

(6) Factors Contributing to Oil Losses in CPO

# Planting Materials

The planting material has a significant influence on the FFB quality. The oil palm fruits in Malaysia are mainly divided into three generic forms which is Dura, Pisifera and Tenera. The hybrid of Dura and Pisifera ("DxP") produces Tenera variety that has high mesocarp oil content and becomes the basis of modern plantation and commercial oil palm today.

The Group has taken the initiative to use clonal materials (Yangambi) as planting materials for the replanting. The results of various progeny trials under inland conditions and also under flat terrain with high water table have shown conclusively that Yangambi has produced good oil yields. Other than producing high yields, Yangambi also gives bigger fruit size, thicker mesocarp and reduced spikiness of the bunches which was more desired by the Malaysian oil palm industry.

On another note, the FFB production capability and OER among the Teneras depend on their genetics. To increase oil yield, a hybrid oil palm seed with unique characteristics was produced by an oil palm research centre known as Applied Agricultural Resources Sdn. Bhd. ("AAR"). The hybrid has features such as lower height, longer economic life span, shorter and lighter fronds, compacted crown, a high number of FFB and smaller palm size that can facilitate harvesting. Considering AAR seedling as our planting materials could help to improve the OER as well as to increase the oil content in the oil palm bunches.

# Loose Fruit Collection

In the harvesting process, it is important that the workers diligently collect all the loose fruits as loose fruits contain more oil components as compared to bunches. All loose fruits should be collected without contamination by ground debris and stone to maintain high OER. Uncollected loose fruits have been identified as one of the factors that contribute to oil losses as the loose fruits constitute approximately  $7 - 8\%$  of FFB weight that contributes to  $3 - 4\%$  of OER.

Loose fruits collection in the Group's operation has improved in the past few years as estates had assigned local Orange Asli people to execute the work. The Group also has established a special task force team to inspect the work of loose fruits collection in each estate. The purpose of this team is to ensure that each estate practices GAP by ensuring that there are no uncollected loose fruits.

# Ripeness Standard

Oil losses could occur during harvesting work by harvesting underripe or overripe bunches. The important process in oil palm plantation is to harvest FFB at the optimum ripeness for maximum oil yield. The extraction rate obtained by the factory is greatly affected by oil palm fruit ripeness standards since the oil content of fruit increases rapidly.

The ripeness standard is defined by reference to the number of loose or detached fruits, with ten loose fruits on the ground. The maturity level influenced oil yield and Free Fatty Acids ("FFA") content. Overripe bunches will result in a higher yield effect but the lower oil quality which is caused by higher FFA content.

The harvesting interval should be adapted to the speed at which loose fruits detach from the ripe bunch to minimise losses from uncollected loose fruits and overripe bunches. Harvesting rounds are usually extended during the peak crop season whereby the loose fruits detached are more than the optimum requirement.

The Group are currently maintaining the two rounds of harvesting per month. To ensure no delay in the harvesting and collection process, the Group has maximised the usage of mechanisation as well as to recruit sufficient harvesters to ensure no extended harvesting rounds especially during peak crop season.

# Transportation of FFB

FFB evacuation is one of the important processes to ensure FFB are delivered to the mills within the timeframe. It is crucial to have a proper transportation system to ensure that the FFB is delivered to the mills within 24 hours to avoid oil losses. Double handling of the FFB also should be avoided to ensure that the high quality of FFB is processed by the mills. Most of these estates no longer use the ramp system to avoid double handling for FFB. The diagram below shows the FFB evacuation system that FEHB has been practicing: -

![](images/d9ff7456a1f6d16f260e91fde1f4f36435541df608644bf9b519f5a4c490090f.jpg)

For smooth evacuation process, FEHB has been maintaining the estates' road with a road grading program which is done on yearly basis. The estates have targeted the selected roads to be graded to ensure the roads are passable and in good condition.

# Labour Shortage

Palm oil sector is reliant on foreign labour and has struggled to bring in more workers for year 2022. Field workers are the core structure of the Group's operation. Any shortfall in this workforce triggers a cascading effect that will lead to decrease production of FFB primarily regarding harvesting and transporting of FFB.

Harvesters are the main workers that impact directly towards oil losses in oil palm. Shortage of harvesters will result in low production and unharvested of FFB. With the entry of the foreign labour coupled with the mechanisation implementation, the Group managed to resolve the shortage and was able to complete most of the operational works in the estates for the financial year 2023.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Members of Far East Holdings Berhad Registration No.: 197301001753 (14809-W) (Incorporated in Malaysia)

# Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements

# Opinion

We have audited the financial statements of Far East Holdings Berhad, which comprise the statements of financial position as at 31 December 2023 and the statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows of the Group and of the Company for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including material accounting policy information, as set out on pages 99 to 146.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and of the Company as at 31 December 2023, and of their financial performance and their cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia.

# Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Independence and Other Ethical Responsibilities

We are independent of the Group and of the Company in accordance with the By-Laws (on Professional Ethics, Conduct and Practice) of the Malaysian Institute of Accountants ("By-Laws") and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) ("IESBA Code"), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the By-Laws and IESBA Code.

# Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matter that, in our professional judgement, were of the most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on this matter.

We have determined that there is no key audit matter to communicate for the Company. The key audit matter for the Group is as below:

# Equity accounting for associates

As disclosed in Note 13 to the financial statements, the Group has significant interests in associates, including, Prosper Capital Holdings Sdn. Bhd. ("PCH"), which has significant associates of its own and with the existence of substantial cross shareholdings in the Group.

Given the highly complex group structure which involves cross shareholdings, we identified the accounting for equity accounted associates as a key audit matter in view of the risk that the associates may not have been properly accounted for and disclosed appropriately due to the following reasons:

(i) The magnitude of the balances; and  
(ii) The complexity of the group structure where significant time and effort was spent to navigate and examine the group structures of the associates (including its various sub-groups and the financial implications) during our review of the consolidation procedures impacting the Group. The process is further complicated by the varied locations and different management teams involved in the associates.

Registration No.: 197301001753 (14809-W)

(Incorporated in Malaysia)

# Key Audit Matters (cont'd)

Our audit performed and responses thereon

We have performed the following procedures:

- Obtained the larger corporate structure of which the Group is a component and performed reviews on the navigation of the various entities involved and the manner in which the financial results of these various entities are consolidated and/or equity accounted and/or both.  
- Communication with various component auditors including the reviews of consolidation and audit files.  
- Performed reviews with regards to the cross shareholdings and the adjustments involving the elimination of the Group's own results as the Group equity accounts for its share of profits of PCH, which has an indirect equity interest in the Group.  
- Performed recomputation of the post-acquisition results in the Group's share of net assets of PCH to ensure that the consolidation adjustments been properly effected.

# Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditors' Report Thereon

The Directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report but does not include the financial statements of the Group and of the Company and our auditors' report thereon.

Our opinion on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, our responsibility is to read the Annual Report and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report the fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

# Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Statements

The Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that give a true and fair view in accordance with Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards, International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements of the Group and of the Company that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, the Directors are also responsible for assessing the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

# Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

(a) Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

# Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements (cont'd)

(b) Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's and of the Company's internal control.  
(c) Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors.  
(d) Conclude on the appropriateness of the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.  
(e) Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.  
(f) Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements of the Group. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with the Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company for the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

# Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements

In accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia, we report that the subsidiaries of which we have not acted as auditors are disclosed in Note 12 to the financial statements.

# Other Matter

This report is made solely to the members of the Company as a body, in accordance with Section 266 of the Companies Act 2016 in Malaysia and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility to any other person for the contents of this report.

# 2. BASIS OF PREPARATION (cont'd)

# (b) Basis of measurement

The financial statements of the Group and of the Company have been prepared on the historical cost convention except for those as disclosed in the notes.

# (c) Functional and presentation currency

These financial statements are presented in Ringgit Malaysia ("RM"), which is the Group's and the Company's functional currency.

# (d) Significant accounting estimates and judgements

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with MFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.

There are no significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements other than disclosed in Note 11 – valuation of investment property.

# 3. OTHER ACCOUNTING POLICIES

# (a) Basis of consolidation

Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries as at the reporting date. The financial statements of the subsidiaries used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are prepared for the same reporting date as the Company. Consistent accounting policies are applied for like transactions and events in similar circumstances

Subsidiaries are consolidated when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Company loses control of the subsidiary.

Losses within a subsidiary are attributed to the non-controlling interests even if that results in a deficit balance.

Changes in the Group's ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in the Group losing control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the Group's interest and the noncontrolling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. The resulting difference is recognised directly in equity.

When control ceases, the disposal proceeds and the fair value of any retained investment are compared to the Group's share of the net assets disposed. The difference together with the carrying amount of allocated goodwill and reserves that relate to the subsidiary is recognised as gain or loss on disposal.

Associates are entities, in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.

Investments in associates are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method less any impairment losses. The cost of the investment includes transaction costs. The consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associates, after adjustments if any, to align the accounting policies with those of the Group, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.

When the Group's share of losses exceeds its interest in an associate, the carrying amount of that interest including any long-term investments is reduced to zero, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an obligation to fund the associate's operations or has made payments on behalf of the associate.

Goodwill relating to an associated company is included in the carrying amount of the investment. The goodwill is calculated as the difference between the cost of the investment and the investor's share of the net fair value of the investee's identifiable assets and liabilities.

When the Group ceases to have significant influence over an associate, any retained interest in the former associate at the date when significant influence is lost is measured at fair value and this amount is regarded as the initial carrying amount of a financial asset. The difference between the fair value of any retained interest plus proceeds from the interest disposed of and the carrying amount of the investment at the date when equity method is discontinued is recognised in profit or loss.

When the Group's interest in an associate decrease but does not result in a loss of significant influence, any retained interest is not re-measured. Any gain or loss arising from the decrease in interest is recognised in profit or loss. Any gains or losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income are also reclassified proportionately to profit or loss.

Dividend from associates is recognised as a reduction in the carrying amounts of associates.

The associates' financial statements shall be prepared using uniform accounting policies for the transactions and events in similar circumstances.

# (a) Basis of consolidation (cont'd)

Transactions eliminated on consolidation

Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions between subsidiaries in the Group, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted associates and joint ventures are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group's interest in the investees. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.

# 10. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (cont'd)

Acquisition of property, plant and equipment of the Group and of the Company are satisfied entirely by cash.

# 10.1 Material accounting policy information

Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.

(i) Recognition and measurement

Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the assets and any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to working condition for its intended use, cost of replacing component parts of the assets, and the present value of the expected cost for the decommissioning of the assets after their use, if applicable.

The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour. For qualifying assets, borrowing costs are capitalised in accordance with the accounting policy on borrowing costs. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

Plant and machineries are stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses and includes borrowing cost incurred during the period of construction, if any. No depreciation is provided on work-in-progress and upon completion, the cost will be transferred to the respective component of property, plant and equipment.

When significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

Property, plant and equipment are derecognised upon disposal; or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Gains or losses arising on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are determined as the difference between the disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the assets and are recognised in profit or loss.

(ii) Subsequent costs

The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Group and to the Company and their costs can be measured reliably. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

(iii) Depreciation

Depreciation is based on the cost of an asset less its estimated residual value. Significant components of individual assets are assessed, and if a component has a useful life that is different from the remainder of that asset, then that component is depreciated separately.

# 10. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (cont'd)

# 10.1 Material accounting policy information (cont'd)

(iii) Depreciation (cont'd)

Depreciation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful lives of each component of an item of property, plant and equipment at the following estimated useful lives:

Buildings 10 years  
Plant and machineries 5 years  
Motor vehicles, furniture, fixtures and equipment 3 - 5 years

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at end of the reporting period and adjusted as appropriate.

Fully depreciated property, plant and equipment are retained in the financial statements until they are no longer in use and no further charge for depreciation is made in respect of these property, plant and equipment.

# Bearer plants

Bearer plants are living trees that are the source of supply of agricultural products and where production is expected for more than one period with a remote likelihood of being sold as other than agricultural produce. Bearer plants comprise of pre-cropping cost incurred for new plantings and replanting.

The carrying values of bearer plants are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The useful life and depreciation method are reviewed at each financial year end to ensure that the amount, method and period of depreciation are consistent with previous estimates and the expected pattern of consumption of the future benefits.

Depreciation is recognised in the profit or loss on straight line basis over its estimated useful lives of bearer plants at the following estimated useful lives:

Bearer plants - after maturity

22 years

A bearer plant is derecognised upon disposal; or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the bearer plant is included in profit or loss in the year the bearer plant is derecognised.

# 11. INVESTMENT PROPERTY (cont'd)

The fair value of the above investment property was estimated based on indicative valuation by an independent registered valuer dated 5 January 2024, which was based on the comparison method.

Changes in fair value are recognised in the statement of profit or loss during the reporting period in which they are reviewed.

There was no income derived from the above investment property. However, there is a quit rent expense of RM44,120 (2022: RM44,120).

# 11.1 Material accounting policy information

Investment property is property which is owned or held to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or for both, but not for sale in the ordinary course of business, use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes.

Investment property is measured initially at its cost. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the investment property. Investment property is subsequently measured at fair value with any change therein recognised in profit or loss for the period in which they arise.

An investment property is derecognised on its disposal, or when it is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected from its disposal. The difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount is recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the items in derecognised.

# (i) Unquoted Share At Fair Value Through Profit or Loss

Current financial year

The investee entity has undergone corporate exercise which entails the following:

a. Capital reduction by way of returning to the shareholders the paid up share capital which is in excess of the needs of the Group and of the Company; and  
b. Share distribution of the subsidiary of the investee company.

The Group and the Company have recognised the above as capital repayment and the money received amounted to RM581,180 has been recognised as 'other income'. The Directors did not recognise the share of subsidiary of investee company because the Directors are in the view that it is not material.

Prior financial year

This investment does not have a quoted market price in an active market. As the investee company is dormant and there were no operations during the current and previous financial years, the Group and the Company has determined the fair value to be nil.

The fair value of the Group's and of the Company's other financial asset were within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

There were no transfers between all three levels of the fair value hierarchy during the financial year.

# (ii) Debt Instruments

Quoted corporate bonds comprise of strategic investments of the Group and the Company which is not held for trading purpose. These debt instruments are recognised at fair value through other comprehensive income ("FVOCI"), the changes in fair value are accumulated within the financial assets and fair value reserve within equity as disclosed in Note 21. The accumulated changes in fair value are transferred to profit or loss when the investment is derecognised or disposed.

# 15.1 Material accounting policy information

The Group and the Company recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use assets are initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.

# 15. RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS (cont'd)

# 15.1 Material accounting policy information (cont'd)

The right-of-use assets are subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use assets or the end of the lease term. The estimated useful lives of the right-of-use assets are determined as follows:

Lease of land

Leasehold land

Office units and warehouses

Motor vehicles

Over the lease period ranging from 50 to 59 years

Over the lease period ranging from 52 to 98 years

Over the lease period

5 years

In addition, the right-of-use assets are periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurement of the lease liabilities.

# 16. BIOLOGICAL ASSETS (cont'd)

FFB prior to harvest (unharvested FFB) (cont'd)

The Group and the Company attribute a fair value on the unharvested FFB at each statement of financial position date as required under MFRS 141 Agriculture. FFB are the produce of oil palm trees and are harvested continuously throughout the financial year. Each FFB take approximately 22 weeks from pollination to reach maximum oil content to be ready for harvesting. The value of each FFB at cash point of the FFB production cycle will vary based on the cumulative oil content in each fruit.

In determining the fair value of unharvested FFB, management uses estimates of cash flows using the expected output method and observable market price of FFB. Management has considered the oil content of all unripe FFB from the week after pollination to the week prior to harvest. As the oil content accrues exponentially in the 2 weeks prior to harvest, the FFB prior to 2 weeks before harvesting is excluded in the valuation as the fair values are considered to be negligible.

The fair value of the Group's and of the Company's unharvested FFB were within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

There were no transfers between all three levels of the fair value hierarchy during the financial year.

# 16.1 Material accounting policy information

Biological assets comprised of produce growing on bearer plants. Biological assets are measured at fair value less costs to sell. Any gain or losses arising from changes in the fair value less costs to sell are recognised in profit or loss.

Biological assets are classified as current assets for produce that are expected to be harvested and sold on a date not more than 12 months after the reporting date.

# Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies

The Group's and the Company's activities are exposed to a variety of financial risks which include credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk. The Group's and the Company's overall financial risk management policy focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group's and the Company's financial performance.

Risk management is an integral to the whole business of the Group and of the Company. Management continually monitors the Group's and the Company's risk management process to ensure that an appropriate balance between risk and control is achieved. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in the market conditions and the Group's and the Company's activities.

There have been no changes to the Group's and the Company's exposure to these financial risks or the manner in which they manage and measure the risk.

# (a) Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. The Group's and the Company's exposure to credit risk arises principally from their receivables (which consist of trade and other receivables, amounts due from subsidiaries, amounts due from associates and amounts due from related parties). For other financial assets (including cash and bank balances and fixed deposits with licensed banks), the Group and the Company minimise credit risk by dealing exclusively with high credit rating counterparties. There are no significant changes as compared to prior periods.

# Trade receivables

Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk

Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. Credit risk is minimised and monitored via strictly limiting the Group's and the Company's associations to business partners with good credit rating. Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit over a certain amount.

At each reporting date, the Group and the Company assess whether any of the trade receivables are credit impaired.

There are no significant changes as compared to previous financial year.

Exposure to credit risk, credit quality and collateral

As the Group and the Company do not hold any collateral, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of the financial assets as at the end of the reporting period.

Concentration of credit risk

The Group and the Company determine concentration of credit risk by monitoring the profiles of their receivables on an ongoing basis.

As at 31 December 2023, the Group and the Company have significant concentration of credit risk arising from the amount owing by 2 customers (2022: 2 customers) constituting  $82\%$  (2022:  $87\%$ ) and 1 customers (2022: 1 customers) constituting  $100\%$  (2022:  $100\%$ ) of gross trade receivables of the Group and of the Company respectively.

Recognition and measurement of impairment loss

The Group and the Company apply the MFRS 9 simplified approach to measure Expected Credit Losses ("ECL") which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for trade receivables.

The Group and the Company assess impairment of trade receivables on individual basis. For individual assessment, it is due to the number of debtors is minimal and these debtors can be individually managed by the Group in an effective and efficient manner. The Group has reasonable and supportable information available to assess the impairment individually. All these customers have low risk of default.

The following table provides information about the exposure to credit risk and ECL for trade receivables as at reporting date which are grouped together as they are expected to have similar risk nature.

Receivables that are not past due nor impaired

Trade receivables that are not past due nor impaired are creditworthy debtors with good payment records and mostly are regular customers that have been transacting with the Group and the Company.

Receivables that are past due not impaired

The Group has not provided for these trade receivables as there has been no significant changes in their credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.

Credit Impaired

Trade receivables that are individually determined to be impaired at the reporting date relate to debtors that are in significant financial difficulties and have defaulted on payments which past due more than 90 days. The Group and the Company do not hold any collateral over these balances.

(a) Credit risk (cont'd)

Other receivables and deposits

Expected credit loss of other receivables is determined individually after considering the financial strength of the other receivables. As at the end of the reporting period, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by their carrying amounts in the statements of financial position. Other receivables are neither past due nor impaired. The Group and the Company believe that generally no allowance for impairment in necessary as these debtors have good records of payment in the past.

Deposits mainly arise from deposits paid for leasehold lands of which the Group and the Company is pending for transfer of land title from the Pengarah Tanah and Galian Pahang and Pentadbir Tanah Daerah Pekan. These deposits paid for leasehold lands will be capitalised in property plant and equipment upon transfer of land titles and thus have low credit risk. As at the end of the reporting period, no allowance for impairment is necessary in respect of the deposits.

# Cash and cash equivalents

The cash and cash equivalents are held with banks and financial institutions. As at the reporting period, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by their carrying amounts in the statements of financial position. These banks and financial institutions have low credit risks. Hence, a loss allowance is not necessary.

# Related party balances (including subsidiaries, associates and other related parties)

Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk

Trade

Intercompany receivable (trade) represents amounts outstanding arising from sales of goods.

In arriving at loss allowance, the same assumptions as trade receivables have been applied and management is of the view that there is no indication of impairment loss in respect of amounts due from associates and related parties as at the reporting date.

(a) Credit risk (cont'd)

Related party balances (including subsidiaries, associates and other related parties) (cont'd)

Non-trade

The Group and the Company provide unsecured loans and payment on behalf to its subsidiaries, associates, and related parties. The Group and the Company monitor the ability of these subsidiaries and related parties to repay the loans and payment on behalf on an individual basis.

Exposure to credit risk, credit quality and collateral

As at the end of the reporting period, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by their carrying amounts in the statement of financial position. Loans and payment on behalf provided are not secured by any collateral or supported by any other credit enhancements.

Recognition and measurement of impairment loss

Loans and payment on behalf with subsidiaries, associates and related parties are repayable on demand. For loans that are repayable on demand, expected credit losses are assessed based on the assumption that repayment of the loan is demanded at the reporting date.

Generally, the Group and the Company consider loans and payment on behalf to subsidiaries, associates, and related parties to have low credit risk. The Group and the Company assume that there is a significant increase in credit risk when the entity's financial position deteriorates significantly. As the Group and the Company are able to determine or influence the timing of payments of the subsidiaries', associates' and related parties' loans and payment on behalf when they are payable, the Group and the Company consider a subsidiaries', and related parties' loan or payment on behalf to be credit impaired when the respective entities are unlikely to repay its loan or payment on behalf to the Group and to the Company in full given insufficient highly liquid resources when the payment on behalf are demanded.

The Group and the Company determine the probability of default for these loans and payment on behalf individually using internal information available.

As at the year end, there were no indications of impairment loss in respect of these amounts.

(b) Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group and the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting financial obligations when they fall due. The Group's and the Company's exposure to liquidity risk arises primarily from mismatches of various payables and lease liabilities.

The Group and the Company actively manage their operating cash flows and the availability of funding so as to ensure that all refinancing, repayment and funding needs are met.

# (c) Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group's exposure to interest rate risk arises mainly from interest-bearing financial assets and financial liabilities.

The interest rate profile of the Group's and the Company's significant interest-bearing financial instruments, based on carrying amounts as at the end of the reporting year was:

<table><tr><td></td><td colspan="2">Group and Company</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2023</td><td>2022</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>RM</td><td>RM</td></tr></table>

Floating rate instruments:

- Term loan

101,250,000 116,250,000

The Group and the Company is exposed to interest rate risk through the impact of rate changes in floating term loan. The interest rate of term loan is disclosed in Note 24. The changes of 100 basis points in interest rates would not have material impact on the profit or loss of the Group and the Company.

# 30. FAIR VALUE INFORMATION

Assets and liabilities carried at fair value

The fair value measurement hierarchies used to measure non-financial assets at fair values in the statements of financial position are disclosed in Notes 11, 14 and 16.

There was no material transfer between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the financial year.

Financial instrument other than those carried at fair value

Financial instruments that are not carried at fair value and whose carrying amounts are reasonable approximation of fair values

The carrying amounts of short-term receivables and payables and cash and cash equivalents approximate their fair values due to the relatively short-term nature of these financial instruments and insignificant impact of discounting.

The carrying amount of long-term floating rate loan approximates its fair value as the loans will be re-priced to market interest rate on or near reporting date.

# 31. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

The Group's and the Company's objectives when managing capital is to maintain a strong capital base and safeguard the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Group and the Company monitor and maintain an optimal debt-to-equity ratio that complies with debt covenants and regulatory requirements.

The Group monitors capital using debt-to-equity ratio which is the debt divided by total equity. Debt includes borrowings and lease liabilities, whilst total capital is equity attributable to Owners of the Company.

The debt-to-equity ratios at end of the reporting period are as follows:

<table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">Group</td><td colspan="2">Company</td></tr><tr><td>2023 RM</td><td>2022 RM</td><td>2023 RM</td><td>2022 RM</td></tr><tr><td>Borrowings and lease liabilities</td><td>117,512,874</td><td>132,662,636</td><td>101,539,646</td><td>116,651,903</td></tr><tr><td>Total equity attributable to the Owners of the Company</td><td>1,382,842,634</td><td>1,372,699,233</td><td>727,595,088</td><td>733,259,782</td></tr><tr><td>Debt-to-equity ratio (%)</td><td>8%</td><td>10%</td><td>14%</td><td>16%</td></tr></table>
