# Section 3: Business Analysis

## 3.1 Profitability Analysis

| Perspective | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | The company's operating revenues and other gains decreased by 14.00% on a reported basis from $4,491.00 million in 2023 to $3,861.00 million in 2024. On an adjusted basis, the decrease was 1.20%. Mobile service revenue increased by 3.10% to $1,010.00 million in 2024, surpassing $1.00 billion for the first time, driven by consumer connection growth, price increases, and stabilized roaming revenues. Broadband revenue declined by 2.10% to $613.00 million in 2024 due to lower connection numbers and average revenue per user (ARPU). IT revenue decreased by 1.60% to $692.00 million, with IT services revenue declining by 14.90% while IT products grew by 3.50%. Data centre revenue saw significant growth of 54.20% to $37.00 million, and high-tech revenue increased by 21.50% to $79.00 million. The gross margin (calculated as (Operating Revenues - Product Costs) / Operating Revenues) for the segment results decreased from 53.50% in 2023 to 53.47% in 2024, indicating a slight compression in profitability from direct operations. |
| Operating Efficiency | The company's operating efficiency, as measured by EBITDAI, decreased by 32.50% on a reported basis from $1,722.00 million in 2023 to $1,163.00 million in 2024.

Other operating expenses increased by 8.70% to $437.00 million, driven by higher Connexa lease charges, bad debt costs, and severance costs. The operating margin (EBITDAI / Operating Revenues and Other Gains) decreased significantly from 38.34% in 2023 to 30.12% in 2024 on a reported basis, and from 30.53% to 30.12% on an adjusted basis, indicating a decline in overall operating efficiency. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate on reported net earnings before income tax increased significantly from -1.48% in 2023 to 38.52% in 2024. The 2023 effective tax rate was heavily influenced by the net gain on sale of Connexa of $583.00 million and the Spark Sport provision of $54.00 million, which resulted in a tax credit of $168.00 million. In 2024, a one-off non-cash tax adjustment of $26.00 million related to the zero-rating of tax depreciation on buildings contributed to the higher tax expense. Adjusted net earnings in 2023 were $433.00 million, with an adjusted tax expense of $185.00 million, resulting in an adjusted effective tax rate of 29.90%. In 2024, adjusted net earnings were $342.00 million, with the $26.00 million tax adjustment, leading to a higher effective tax rate compared to the adjusted 2023 figure. |
