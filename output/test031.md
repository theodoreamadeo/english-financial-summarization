# Section 3: Business Analysis

## 3.1 Profitability Analysis

| Perspective | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue from continuing operations increased from $206,003.00 thousand in 2023 to $337,285.00 thousand in 2024, representing a growth of 63.72%. This significant increase was primarily driven by a substantial rise in almond crop volume (from 19,771.00 MT to 29,527.00 MT, a 49.34% increase) and a higher average almond price (from $6.42/kg to $7.69/kg, a 19.78% increase). The company also saw a notable increase in external grower volumes, contributing to higher revenue. Gross margin, calculated as (Revenue - Cost of Sales) / Revenue, improved significantly from -12.83% in 2023 to 1.86% in 2024. This improvement indicates better cost management relative to revenue, despite cost of sales increasing from $232,427.00 thousand in 2023 to $331,024.00 thousand in 2024. Revenue distribution by product/service shows an increase in both value-added almond products (from $44.20 million to $45.80 million) and non-value-added products (from $159.20 million to $288.90 million). Geographically, the company operates predominantly within Australia but continues to build strong relationships in fast-growing markets like India and China, leveraging tariff advantages. |
| Operating Efficiency | The company's operating efficiency saw a dramatic turnaround. Operating income (EBIT) improved from a loss of $149,314.00 thousand in 2023 to a profit of $16,257.00 thousand in 2024. The operating margin, calculated as EBIT/Revenue, improved from -72.48% in 2023 to 4.82% in 2024. This significant improvement is attributed to increased crop volume, higher almond prices, reduced production costs (from $10.18/kg to $6.60/kg), and increased processing capacity and efficiency. Administrative expenses remained relatively stable, decreasing slightly from $18,364.00 thousand in 2023 to $18,157.00 thousand in 2024, indicating effective cost control in this area. The processing facility increased total productive capacity by approximately 30% to 40,000 MT and processed a record 40,047 MT of product in FY2024, while simultaneously reducing processing costs by 8.10%. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate, calculated as Income Tax Benefit / Profit Before Tax, changed significantly. In 2023, the company reported a tax benefit of $44,799.00 thousand on a loss before tax of $159,526.00 thousand, resulting in an effective tax rate of -28.08%. This negative rate indicates a significant tax benefit, likely due to the utilization of prior year losses or other tax adjustments. In 2024, the company reported a tax benefit of $225.00 thousand on a profit before tax of $1,275.00 thousand, resulting in an effective tax rate of 17.65%. This change reflects a shift from a loss-making to a profit-making position, altering the tax impact. Non-recurring items significantly affected profitability in both years. In 2023, these included a $25,995.00 thousand impairment of goodwill and a $4,085.00 thousand impairment of bearer plants due to flood damage, totaling $30,080.00 thousand. In 2024, one-off items included a $6,700.00 thousand profit on the sale of water rights, a $6,600.00 thousand impairment of the Yilgah Right-of-Use asset, and $1,000.00 thousand in costs related to logistics issues, resulting in a net one-off impact of -$834.00 thousand. The underlying EBIT, excluding these one-off items, improved from -$119,234.00 thousand in 2023 to $17,091.00 thousand in 2024. |

## 3.2 Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | The company's financial health significantly improved, moving from a net loss to a net profit. Total assets increased to $1,010,068.00 thousand from $913,250.00 thousand, driven by increases in current assets (especially trade and other receivables and inventories). Net assets grew to $480,759.00 thousand from $411,525.00 thousand, largely due to a successful equity raise of $80,000.00 thousand. Net debt decreased to $162,330.00 thousand from $190,188.00 thousand, and the gearing ratio improved to 33.80% from 46.20%. Operating cash flow saw a substantial increase to $21,349.00 thousand from -$8,246.00 thousand, indicating strong cash generation. | The company faced significant financial challenges, reporting a net loss after tax of $114,727.00 thousand. Total assets were $913,250.00 thousand, and net assets were $411,525.00 thousand. Net debt (including lease liabilities) increased to $419,843.00 thousand from $376,648.00 thousand in 2022, with a high gearing ratio of 102.00%. Operating cash flow was negative at -$8,246.00 thousand, reflecting operational difficulties and lower sales receipts. The company relied on increased borrowings to fund operations and investments. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability saw a remarkable turnaround, with Net Profit After Tax (NPAT) of $1,500.00 thousand compared to a loss of $114,727.00 thousand in 2023. Basic Earnings Per Share (EPS) improved to 1.24 cents from -94.80 cents. Underlying EBITDA from continuing operations surged to $46,879.00 thousand from -$86,987.00 thousand. The quality of earnings improved as the company returned to normal operating conditions, driven by higher crop volumes, increased almond prices, and reduced production costs. The effective tax rate was 17.65%, reflecting a tax benefit on a positive pre-tax income. | The company experienced a significant decline in profitability, reporting a Net Loss After Tax (NPAT) of $114,727.00 thousand. Basic Earnings Per Share (EPS) was -94.80 cents. Underlying EBITDA from continuing operations was -$86,987.00 thousand. Earnings quality was poor, heavily impacted by a 34% lower crop volume, a $24,500.00 thousand write-down of 2022 crop inventory due to quality issues, and a $26,000.00 thousand goodwill impairment. The effective tax rate was -28.08%, indicating a tax benefit on a pre-tax loss. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency improved substantially. Revenue from continuing operations increased by 63.72% to $337,285.00 thousand. The total cost of production (growing, harvest, and processing) decreased to $6.60/kg from $10.18/kg in 2023 (on a 29,527 MT crop). Processing costs per kg reduced substantially due to increased processing capacity and higher third-party processing volumes. The Project Management Office (PMO) delivered $32,000.00 thousand in profit, with a net positive impact of $20,000.00 thousand after accounting for inflationary pressures and logistics issues. Sales velocity accelerated, with contracted sales volume increasing to 36,624.00 MT from an average of 27,793.00 MT over the past three years. | Operational efficiency was severely challenged. Revenue from continuing operations decreased by 12.50% to $206,003.00 thousand. Crop production costs increased by 23.40% due to higher fertilizer and chemical prices, increased orchard lease costs, and higher labor costs, exacerbated by a 38% lower crop volume. The total cost of production was $10.18/kg on a 19,771 MT crop. The value-adding facility's results were impacted by processing lower-quality 2022 stock and declining sales prices for finished goods. The PMO identified $8,900.00 thousand in profit and $18,500.00 thousand in cash value, but these gains were offset by the impact of the lower crop. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk decreased significantly. Net debt reduced to $162,330.00 thousand, and the gearing ratio improved to 33.80%. The company successfully completed an $80,000.00 thousand capital raise, strengthening its balance sheet. All banking covenants were in compliance as of 30 September 2024. The company's cash flow forecasts indicate it will operate within its current lending limits and meet required covenant measures for at least the next 12 months, even under downside scenarios (e.g., a 10% reduction in 2024 volumes and pricing would not lead to a covenant breach). | Financial risk increased, with net debt (including lease liabilities) rising to $419,843.00 thousand and a gearing ratio of 102.00%. The company faced limited headroom in its Fixed Charge Cover (FCC) covenant for FY2024 testing dates, with a 5.60% change in almond price or yield potentially leading to a breach. Operating cash outflows of -$8,246.00 thousand indicated liquidity pressure. The company secured credit approval for increased banking facilities and adjusted covenants to manage the situation. |
| Future financial performance projection | The future outlook is highly positive. The company expects continued improvement in crop yield through horticultural excellence, increased external third-party almond supply, and a further 25% increase in processing capacity by FY2026. Almond prices are forecast to increase in FY2025 due to declining US acreage, lower carry-over inventories, and strong global demand. The company's cash flow forecasts indicate compliance with lending limits and covenants. Strategic investments in pre-cleaners and driers will improve quality during wet seasons. The global outlook for almonds and plant-based foods remains strong. | The outlook was challenging but with signs of potential recovery. The 2024 crop was progressing well with a successful bloom and favorable drier/hotter conditions forecast. The company expected the 2024 theoretical crop to be 30,000-32,000 MT. USD almond prices were forecast to increase in FY2024 due to lower US crop estimates and quality issues. Management initiatives through the PMO were expected to drive profit and cash flow. However, the company acknowledged limited headroom in FCC covenants for FY2024, making it sensitive to changes in crop forecasts. |
