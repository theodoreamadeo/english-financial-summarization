# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | **Competition and Market Demand:** The electricity demand in Peninsular Malaysia grew by 6.5% in 2024, driven by industrial sector recovery and the burgeoning digital economy, particularly data centers. However, the global energy market experienced fluctuating coal prices, posing challenges to electricity tariff management. The government's continued focus on sustainable development, as outlined in the National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR), served as an impetus for growth, attracting significant domestic and foreign investments. The New Industrial Master Plan, promoting data center expansion, increased energy demand by 1.9GW in 2024. <br> **Economic Conditions:** Global real GDP growth was 3.3% in 2023 and projected to moderate slightly to 3.2% in 2024. Inflation remained a concern due to persistent supply chain issues and energy price fluctuations. Despite external headwinds, Malaysia's economic growth was robust at 5.1% in 2024, primarily due to continued expansion in domestic demand and a rebound in exports. <br> **Political Factors:** Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, along with trade tensions between the US and China, continued to affect global supply chains and financial markets. These factors contributed to volatility in energy prices and influenced decarbonization efforts. The government's commitment to the Incentive-Based Regulation (IBR) framework and the NETR provided stability and direction for the energy sector. | **Competition and Market Demand:** Malaysia's electricity demand grew by 3.8% in 2023, driven by domestic and commercial segments. The global energy landscape, particularly the coal sector, experienced significant dynamics due to fluctuating demand and geopolitical tensions. Coal prices, after soaring in 2022, began to stabilize in 2023 but remained higher than the base price set for Regulatory Period 3 (RP3). <br> **Economic Conditions:** Global GDP growth moderated to 3.0% in 2023 from 3.5% in 2022. Malaysia's GDP growth was 3.7% in 2023, tempered by weak external demand despite resilient domestic demand. <br> **Political Factors:** Geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and the Middle East contributed to volatility in gas prices and added complexity to the global energy landscape. The Malaysian government introduced the Madani Economy Framework and launched the National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR) to drive sustainable development and clarify the vision for energy transition. The Imbalance Cost Pass-Through (ICPT) mechanism was crucial in managing fuel price fluctuations. |
| Operational Risks | **Supply Chain Disruptions:** Global supply chains continued to be affected by ongoing conflicts and trade tensions, impacting the availability and cost of materials. <br> **Technology Failures:** An unforeseeable incident on December 4, 2023, led to an 11-month forced outage at the 1,000MW TNB Manjung Unit 4 (M4) coal power plant due to steam turbine blade damage. This required dispatching higher-emissions sub-critical coal power plants to ensure grid security and meet demand. <br> **Human Resource Challenges:** Talent gaps requiring upskilling and reskilling to navigate new and emerging technologies pose a risk. The company addresses this through talent management programs customized for energy transition and technology requirements. <br> **Climate Change Impacts:** Extreme weather events continue to drive decarbonization efforts, necessitating investments in renewable energy technologies and infrastructure. The company faces physical risks from floods, heatwaves, and extreme winds, which can damage infrastructure and disrupt operations. | **Supply Chain Disruptions:** Global supply chains were impacted by geopolitical tensions, contributing to energy price fluctuations. <br> **Technology Failures:** The unexpected outage at the TNB Janamanjung 1GW coal-fired plant in December 2023 significantly affected the plant availability factor. <br> **Human Resource Challenges:** Talent gaps requiring upskilling and reskilling to navigate new and emerging technologies are a concern. The company addresses this through talent management programs customized for energy transition and technology requirements. <br> **Climate Change Impacts:** The year 2023 was the warmest on record, highlighting the impact of climate change. Malaysia is vulnerable to natural hazards like floods and heatwaves, which can affect infrastructure and operations. |
| Financial Risks | **Fuel Price Volatility:** Fluctuating coal prices remained a concern due to persistent supply chain issues and energy price fluctuations. <br> **Investment Risks:** Uncertainty in the deployment of low-emissions technologies due to high investment and technology maturity. <br> **Regulatory Risks:** Uncertainty about the government implementing carbon pricing as an instrument to capture the external cost of GHG emissions. Changes in the Malaysian Electricity Supply Industry (MESI) such as policy, regulatory requirements, and market demands, in line with the transition to a low-carbon economy. <br> **Litigation Exposure:** Lawsuits and fines driven by environmental and climate activism. <br> **Stranded Assets:** Unanticipated or premature write-downs, devaluation, and divestment of carbon-intensive assets. <br> **Reputational Risk:** Increased stakeholder expectations and scrutiny of the company's ESG strategy, management, and performance. | **Fuel Price Volatility:** The average market coal price moderated in 2023 but remained substantially higher than the base price set for RP3, pressuring TNB's cash flow due to high generation costs. <br> **Investment Risks:** Uncertainty in the deployment of low-emission technologies due to high investment and technology maturity. <br> **Regulatory Risks:** Regulatory uncertainty due to decisions by federal, state, and international stakeholders can delay or encumber business operations related to investment, divestment, natural resource use, and right-of-way. <br> **Litigation Exposure:** The Inland Revenue Board (IRB) disallowed the company's Reinvestment Allowance (RIA) claims for several Years of Assessment (YAs), leading to notices of additional assessment totaling RM7,858.6 million. The company has not recorded the potential tax liabilities of RM6,101.4 million, pending legal outcomes. <br> **Stranded Assets:** Unanticipated or premature write-downs, devaluation, and divestment of carbon-intensive assets. <br> **Reputational Risk:** Increased stakeholder expectations and scrutiny of the company's ESG strategy, management, and performance. |
| Compliance Risks | **Regulatory Changes:** Increased expectations from regulatory bodies to track and publicly report emissions. The company is exposed to litigation risks from environmental and climate activism. <br> **Legal Issues:** The company faces ongoing litigation with the Inland Revenue Board (IRB) regarding Reinvestment Allowance (RIA) claims, with potential tax liabilities of RM6,810.7 million. <br> **Industry Standards:** The company is committed to complying with regulatory requirements and actively engaging with relevant stakeholders on environmental and climate management. | **Regulatory Changes:** Increased expectations from regulatory bodies to track and publicly report emissions.
