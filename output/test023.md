# Section 3: Business Analysis

## 3.1 Profitability Analysis

| Perspective | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | The company experienced significant revenue growth from 2023 to 2024. Total underlying revenue increased by 15.83%, from £15,409.00 million in 2023 to £17,848.00 million in 2024. This growth was primarily driven by the Civil Aerospace division, which saw its underlying revenue increase by 22.99% from £7,348.00 million in 2023 to £9,040.00 million in 2024. Defence revenue also grew by 10.92%, from £4,077.00 million to £4,522.00 million, and Power Systems revenue increased by 7.65%, from £3,968.00 million to £4,271.00 million. New Markets, however, experienced a revenue decline of 25.00%, from £4.00 million to £3.00 million. <br><br>The gross margin improved from 20.97% in 2023 to 22.92% in 2024. This improvement indicates better cost management relative to revenue growth. The Civil Aerospace division's gross margin significantly improved from 19.00% to 22.00%, while Defence's gross margin remained relatively stable at 19.70% in 2023 and 20.10% in 2024. Power Systems saw a slight increase in gross margin from 26.50% to 28.10%. New Markets' gross margin deteriorated significantly from 25.00% to -133.30%, reflecting increased operating losses. |
| Operating Efficiency | The company's operating efficiency improved significantly from 2023 to 2024. Underlying operating profit increased by 54.97%, from £1,590.00 million in 2023 to £2,464.00 million in 2024. The underlying operating margin rose from 10.30% to 13.80%, indicating enhanced profitability per unit of revenue. <br><br>Civil Aerospace demonstrated the most substantial improvement in operating efficiency, with its operating margin increasing from 11.60% to 16.60%. Defence also improved its operating margin from 13.80% to 14.20%. Power Systems saw its operating margin rise from 10.40% to 13.10%. In contrast, New Markets continued to operate at a loss, with its underlying operating loss increasing from £(160.00) million to £(177.00) million, reflecting its early-stage business nature and investment in development. <br><br>The total underlying cash costs as a proportion of underlying gross margin (TCC/GM) improved from 0.59 in 2023 to 0.47 in 2024, indicating better cost control and operational leverage. This suggests that the company is becoming more efficient in managing its overheads relative to its gross profit. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate, calculated as taxation divided by profit before taxation, changed significantly from 2023 to 2024. In 2023, the statutory effective tax rate was -0.95% (£(23.00) million / £2,427.00 million), indicating a tax credit. In 2024, the statutory effective tax rate was 11.19% (£250.00 million / £2,234.00 million). The underlying effective tax rate was -9.51% in 2023 (£(120.00) million / £1,262.00 million) and 12.29% in 2024 (£(282.00) million / £2,293.00 million). The negative effective tax rate in 2023 was primarily due to the recognition of a deferred tax asset on UK tax losses. <br><br>Non-recurring items significantly impacted profitability in both years. In 2024, statutory operating profit included a £545.00 million impairment reversal related to a Civil Aerospace program asset and a £191.00 million negative impact from currency hedges in the underlying results. Charges of £294.00 million were excluded from underlying results, comprising £234.00 million in transformation and restructuring charges, £45.00 million for amortisation of intangible assets from acquisitions, £14.00 million pension past service credit, and £1.00 million of other credits. <br><br>In 2023, statutory operating profit included a £475.00 million negative impact from currency hedges in the underlying results. Net charges of £71.00 million were excluded from underlying results, comprising £102.00 million in transformation and restructuring charges, partly offset by £8.00 million in net impairment reversals, £21.00 million in exceptional Trent 1000 program charges, and a £2.00 million pension past service credit. These non-recurring items highlight the company's ongoing transformation efforts and the volatility introduced by currency hedging and asset revaluations. |

## 5.2 Internal Controls

| Field | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Risk assessment procedures | Risks are identified by individuals across all divisions and functions and at different layers of the organization by considering what could stop us from achieving our strategic, operational, or compliance objectives or impact the sustainability of our business model. Risk owners quantify the likelihood of a risk materializing and the potential impact if it does, taking into account current effective controls, and then deciding on a plan of action. | Risks are identified by individuals across all divisions and functions and at different layers of the organization by considering what could stop us from achieving our strategic, operational, or compliance objectives or impact the sustainability of our business model. Risk owners assess the likelihood of a risk materializing and the impact if it does, taking into account current mitigating control activities. |
| Control activities | Risk owners design, implement, and assure the effectiveness of controls to manage the risk, supported by different assurance providers using a three lines of defense approach. Risk owners identify where mitigating actions are needed to bring the risk within appetite, assessing the Group's ability to reduce the impact of risks that materialize and ensuring the costs of operating a control are proportionate to the benefit provided. | Internal controls are designed and deployed to mitigate these risks to an accepted level. Risk owners consider the effectiveness of current mitigating control activities, supported by different assurance providers. Risk owners identify where additional activities may be needed to bring the risk within appetite. A judgment is made by assessing the Group's ability to reduce the impact of risks that do materialize and ensure the costs of operating particular controls are proportionate to the benefit provided. |
| Monitoring mechanisms | Risk owners report their assessment of current and target risk scores to local leadership as well as other review forums (including the Board and its Committees and the Executive Team) as needed depending on the level of the risk, for support, challenge, and oversight. | Risk owners report their assessment of the current risk status and action plans to divisions, functions, and other review forums (including the Executive Team, Board, and Board Committee meetings) as needed depending on the nature of the risk, for support, challenge, and oversight. |
| Identified material weaknesses or deficiencies | In 2024, no significant weaknesses were identified. | In 2023, no significant weaknesses were identified. |
| Improvements | Following the implementation of the new risk framework and oversight approach in February and the implementation of a new organizational design, the company has increasing confidence in the assessment of its risks, with a real focus on mitigating actions to get to an agreed target risk level, as well as more transparent reporting. The company has also seen a positive shift in the risk culture of the organization, with strong risk awareness and engagement. The new framework places even more emphasis on the importance of controls and assurance in managing risks well, and the risk, controls, and assurance (RCA) program has continued to support the design and documentation of controls for principal risks, embedding these controls in the management system. Plans are now in place to ensure readiness to meet the additional reporting requirements of the 2024 UK Corporate Governance Code. The RCA program is a key foundational activity in relation to principal risks and, as such, will form part of the integrated Group-wide plan, which also incorporates other areas such as financial and non-financial reporting (including sustainability reporting requirements) and compliance. | The company made improvements to how it defines, documents, and operates controls (e.g., for the safety and compliance principal risks). This is a key part of how the company mitigates risk and keeps within appetite, alongside assurance so the company knows the mitigation is effective. A risk and its mitigation are continually evaluated in response to external or internal factors changing the nature of the risk and how the company manages it. |
| Effectiveness | The Board confirms that it has monitored the effectiveness of risk management and internal controls throughout the year, in accordance with the Code. The Audit Committee and Board assessed the effectiveness of the risk management and internal controls framework in place across the Group. The Board confirms that, where weaknesses in the Group's internal control environment were identified, plans for remediation were implemented and aligned to an appropriate timeframe. | The Board confirms that it has monitored the effectiveness of risk management and internal controls throughout the year, in accordance with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code.
