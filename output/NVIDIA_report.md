# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Perspective | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue Growth: NVIDIA Corporation experienced significant revenue growth from fiscal year 2023 to fiscal year 2024. Total revenue increased from $26,974 million in 2023 to $60,922 million in 2024, representing a growth of 125.8%. Gross Margin: The gross margin improved substantially from 56.9% in 2023 to 72.7% in 2024, an increase of 15.8 percentage points. This improvement was primarily driven by strong Data Center revenue growth and lower net inventory provisions as a percentage of revenue. Revenue by Product/Service: Data Center revenue surged by 217% from $15,005 million in 2023 to $47,525 million in 2024. Gaming revenue increased by 15% from $9,067 million in 2023 to $10,447 million in 2024. Professional Visualization revenue saw a modest increase of 1% from $1,544 million in 2023 to $1,553 million in 2024. Automotive revenue grew by 21% from $903 million in 2023 to $1,091 million in 2024. OEM and Other revenue decreased by 32.7% from $455 million in 2023 to $306 million in 2024. Revenue by Geographic Region: Revenue from the United States increased by 225.2% from $8,292 million in 2023 to $26,966 million in 2024. Taiwan's revenue increased by 91.9% from $6,986 million in 2023 to $13,405 million in 2024. China (including Hong Kong) revenue increased by 78.1% from $5,785 million in 2023 to $10,306 million in 2024. Revenue from Other countries increased by 73.3% from $5,911 million in 2023 to $10,245 million in 2024. The proportion of revenue from sales outside the United States decreased from 69% in 2023 to 56% in 2024, indicating a stronger growth in the U.S. market. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating Margin: The operating margin significantly improved from 15.6% in fiscal year 2023 to 54.1% in fiscal year 2024. This substantial increase reflects the company's ability to leverage its revenue growth more effectively into operating income, despite an increase in operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by growth in employees and compensation increases, but the revenue growth outpaced these costs. |
| External & One-Off Impact | Effective Tax Rate: The effective tax rate changed from a benefit of 4.5% in fiscal year 2023 to an expense of 12.0% in fiscal year 2024. This increase was due to a decreased impact of tax benefits from the FDII deduction, stock-based compensation, and the U.S. federal research tax credit, relative to the increase in income before income tax. The 2024 rate was partially offset by a benefit due to an IRS audit resolution. Non-Recurring Items: In fiscal year 2023, the company recorded an acquisition termination cost of $1,353 million related to the proposed Arm transaction. This non-recurring expense significantly impacted operating expenses and net income in 2023. In fiscal year 2024, there was no such acquisition termination cost. The fiscal year 2024 also included a non-cash net benefit of $145 million from an IRS audit resolution. The net effect on gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 7.5% in 2023, which improved to an unfavorable impact of 2.7% in 2024. |

## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | NVIDIA's financial health significantly improved in fiscal year 2024, driven by robust revenue growth and enhanced profitability.

Total assets decreased by 6.8% to $41,182 million from $44,187 million in 2022. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities decreased by 37.2% to $13,296 million. Accounts receivable decreased by 17.7% to $3,827 million. Inventories increased by 98.0% to $5,159 million, indicating potential oversupply or reduced demand. Total liabilities increased by 8.6% to $19,081 million, while total shareholders' equity decreased by 16.9% to $22,101 million. The company's liquidity position weakened, and its capital structure became slightly more leveraged. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability and earnings quality saw a dramatic improvement in fiscal year 2024. Net income soared by 581.4% to $29,760 million from $4,368 million in 2023. The net profit margin increased from 16.2% to 48.9%. Return on Equity (ROE) significantly improved from 19.76% to 69.24%. Return on Assets (ROA) also saw a substantial increase from 10.61% to 45.28%. The effective tax rate shifted from a benefit of 4.5% to an expense of 12.0%, reflecting higher taxable income. The absence of the large acquisition termination cost from the prior year also contributed to the improved earnings quality. | In fiscal year 2023, profitability and earnings quality declined significantly. Net income decreased by 55.2% to $4,368 million from $9,752 million in 2022. The net profit margin fell from 36.2% to 16.2%. Return on Equity (ROE) decreased from 36.64% to 19.76%. Return on Assets (ROA) also declined from 22.07% to 10.61%. The effective tax rate was a benefit of 4.5% due to lower profitability and specific tax benefits. The $1,353 million acquisition termination cost negatively impacted earnings quality, representing a significant one-off expense. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency improved significantly in fiscal year 2024. The operating margin increased from 15.6% to 54.1%, indicating better cost management relative to revenue growth. Asset turnover improved from 0.65 to 0.93, suggesting more efficient utilization of assets to generate sales. The increase in revenue outpaced the growth in operating expenses, which rose by only 2% despite significant revenue growth. This demonstrates strong operational leverage and effective management of direct costs. | Operational efficiency declined in fiscal year 2023. The operating margin decreased from 37.3% to 15.6%, primarily due to a flat revenue performance and a 50% increase in operating expenses, which included the $1,353 million acquisition termination cost. Asset turnover decreased from 0.61 to 0.65, indicating a slight improvement in asset utilization despite the overall decline in efficiency. The significant inventory provisions also reflect challenges in managing supply and demand effectively. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | Financial risk indicators remained manageable in fiscal year 2024 despite increased debt. The debt-to-equity ratio decreased from 43.9% to 22.0%, indicating a significant reduction in financial leverage. The current ratio improved from 3.52 to 4.17, showing enhanced short-term liquidity. Interest coverage ratio improved significantly due to higher operating income. The company's strong cash flow from operations provides a substantial buffer against financial distress. The increase in prepaid supply and capacity agreements to $2,458 million (long-term) and $2,500 million (short-term) indicates strategic investments to secure future supply, which could be a risk if demand forecasts are inaccurate, but currently reflects strong growth expectations. | Financial risk indicators showed some deterioration in fiscal year 2023. The debt-to-equity ratio increased from 41.13% to 43.9%, indicating a slight increase in financial leverage. The current ratio decreased from 4.41 to 3.52, suggesting a reduction in short-term liquidity. The interest coverage ratio remained strong, but the overall financial position was impacted by lower profitability and increased inventory. The significant increase in inventory and purchase obligations (totaling $4.92 billion) posed a risk of future write-downs if demand did not materialize as expected. |
