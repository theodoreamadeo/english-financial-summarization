# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue for Airtel Africa plc decreased by 5.30% from $5,255.00M in 2023 to $4,979.00M in 2024. However, in constant currency terms, revenue grew significantly by 20.90% in 2024, accelerating from 17.60% growth in 2023. This indicates that the reported decline was primarily due to adverse currency devaluations, particularly in Nigeria, Malawi, Zambia, and Kenya. <br><br>Gross margin (calculated as Revenue - Network operating expenses - Access charges - Licence fee and spectrum usage charges - Sales and marketing expenses - Impairment loss on financial assets - Other operating expenses) decreased from 33.20% in 2023 to 32.70% in 2024. This slight contraction suggests that while revenue grew in constant currency, the direct costs associated with generating that revenue increased at a comparable or slightly higher rate, or that the impact of reported currency depreciation on costs was more pronounced. <br><br>Revenue by Product/Service: <br>- Voice revenue decreased by 12.50% from $2,491.00M in 2023 to $2,179.00M in 2024 (but grew 11.90% in constant currency). <br>- Data revenue decreased by 3.00% from $1,787.00M in 2023 to $1,734.00M in 2024 (but grew 29.20% in constant currency). <br>- Mobile Money revenue increased by 21.10% from $692.00M in 2023 to $837.00M in 2024 (and grew 32.80% in constant currency). <br>- Other revenue decreased by 4.60% from $437.00M in 2023 to $417.00M in 2024 (but grew 23.40% in constant currency). <br>The shift indicates a strong underlying growth in data and mobile money services, which are key strategic areas for the company, despite the negative impact of currency translation on reported figures. <br><br>Revenue by Geographic Region (Mobile Services): <br>- Nigeria mobile services revenue decreased by 29.40% from $2,128.00M in 2023 to $1,503.00M in 2024 (but grew 25.80% in constant currency). <br>- East Africa mobile services revenue increased by 7.50% from $1,508.00M in 2023 to $1,622.00M in 2024 (and grew 21.50% in constant currency). <br>- Francophone Africa mobile services revenue increased by 11.30% from $1,090.00M in 2023 to $1,213.00M in 2024 (and grew 9.20% in constant currency). <br>The significant reported decline in Nigeria's revenue is primarily due to the substantial devaluation of the Nigerian Naira. However, the strong constant currency growth across all regions highlights robust underlying operational performance. Mobile Money services, reported separately, showed strong growth across East and Francophone Africa. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortisation) decreased by 4.50% from $2,694.00M in 2023 to $2,572.00M in 2024. However, in constant currency terms, expenses increased by 20.90%, indicating that the reported decrease was due to currency translation effects. <br><br>Operating income decreased by 6.70% from $1,757.00M in 2023 to $1,640.00M in 2024. In constant currency, operating income grew by 20.30%, demonstrating strong underlying operational performance despite currency headwinds. <br><br>Operating margin (Operating profit / Revenue) slightly decreased from 33.43% in 2023 to 32.94% in 2024. This marginal decline suggests that while the company managed to control reported operating expenses, the impact of currency depreciation on revenue was more significant, or that the underlying growth in expenses in constant currency outpaced revenue growth. <br><br>The company's ability to maintain a relatively stable operating margin in constant currency (EBITDA margin improved by 14 bps in constant currency) amidst significant macroeconomic challenges, particularly fuel price inflation, indicates effective cost management and operational efficiencies. The focus on optimizing network design, value in contracts, and volume optimization helped mitigate cost pressures. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate showed significant fluctuation. In 2023, the reported effective tax rate was 27.40% (Income tax expense of $284.00M on Profit before tax of $1,034.00M). After adjusting for exceptional items, foreign exchange rate movements, and one-off adjustments, the effective tax rate was 38.80%. <br><br>In 2024, the reported effective tax rate was -41.10% (Income tax expense of $26.00M on Loss before tax of -$63.00M). After adjustments, the effective tax rate was 38.40%. The negative reported rate in 2024 is due to the company reporting a loss before tax, while still incurring a tax charge, primarily due to withholding taxes on dividends by subsidiaries and changes in profit mix between various OpCos. <br><br>Non-Recurring Items: <br>- In 2023, there were no exceptional items impacting profit before tax. However, there was a tax exceptional item of -$161.00M related to deferred tax asset recognition in Kenya, DRC, and Tanzania. <br>- In 2024, exceptional items significantly impacted profitability. Finance costs included $807.00M in exceptional derivative and foreign exchange losses, primarily due to the devaluation of the Nigerian Naira ($770.00M) and Malawian Kwacha ($37.00M). This led to a reported loss before tax of -$63.00M. <br>- Correspondingly, there was a tax exceptional gain of $258.00M in 2024, which is a tax gain corresponding to the $807.00M derivative and foreign exchange losses. <br>These exceptional items in 2024 highlight the significant impact of currency volatility on reported financial performance, masking the underlying operational profitability. |

## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | The company's financial health in 2024 was significantly impacted by currency devaluations, leading to a reported revenue decline of 5.30% to $4,979.00M and a loss after tax of -$89.00M. Total assets decreased by 11.69% to $9,861.00M, and total equity decreased by 39.59% to $2,300.00M. Despite these reported declines, constant currency revenue growth was 20.90%, indicating strong underlying operational performance. Net debt remained stable at $3,505.00M, and the leverage ratio was maintained at 1.40x, demonstrating resilience in debt management. Operating free cash flow was $1,691.00M, a decrease of 7.40% from 2023. | The company demonstrated robust financial health in 2023 with reported revenue growth of 11.50% to $5,255.00M and profit after tax of $750.00M. Total assets increased by 7.74% to $11,166.00M, and total equity grew by 4.36% to $3,808.00M. Net debt increased by 19.86% to $3,524.00M, and the leverage ratio was 1.40x. Operating free cash flow was $1,827.00M, an increase of 10.40% from 2022. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Reported profitability was severely affected by exceptional derivative and foreign exchange losses of $807.00M, resulting in a loss after tax of -$89.00M. Basic EPS was -$4.40 cents, a significant drop from 17.70 cents in 2023. However, underlying profit after tax (excluding exceptional items) was $460.00M, indicating a healthy core business. The effective tax rate, after adjustments, was 38.40%, consistent with previous periods. The quality of earnings was impacted by the non-recurring currency events, making reported figures less representative of ongoing operational performance. | The company achieved strong profitability in 2023 with profit after tax of $750.00M and basic EPS of 17.70 cents, an increase of 5.20% from 2022. Underlying profit after tax was $589.00M. The effective tax rate, after adjustments, was 38.80%. Earnings quality was enhanced by the recognition of deferred tax credits totaling $161.00M in Kenya, DRC, and Tanzania, which were classified as exceptional tax items. This boosted reported profit after tax. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency remained resilient despite macroeconomic challenges. EBITDA margin was 48.80%, a slight decrease of 22 bps from 2023, but improved by 14 bps in constant currency. Operating profit decreased by 6.70% to $1,640.00M, but grew by 20.30% in constant currency. The company's ability to maintain margins amidst fuel price inflation and currency devaluations highlights effective cost management and operational leverage, particularly in the mobile money segment where EBITDA margin rose to 52.10%. | Operational efficiency was strong in 2023, with an underlying EBITDA margin of 49.00%, remaining stable despite inflationary cost pressures. Operating profit increased by 14.50% to $1,757.00M, and by 20.10% in constant currency. The company demonstrated effective cost control and operational leverage, particularly in East Africa and Francophone Africa, where underlying EBITDA margins improved. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | The primary financial risk identified in 2024 was significant foreign exchange risk, particularly the devaluation of the Nigerian Naira and Malawian Kwacha, leading to $807.00M in exceptional derivative and foreign exchange losses. This highlights vulnerability to currency volatility in key markets. The company mitigated this by localizing over 83.00% of OpCo debt to local currency and maintaining a strong cash position at HoldCo to repay upcoming debt. The stable leverage ratio of 1.40x indicates controlled debt levels despite currency impacts. | Financial risks in 2023 included foreign exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures. Net finance costs increased by $320.00M, largely due to higher foreign exchange and derivative losses of $245.00M. The company actively de-risked its balance sheet by localizing debt into OpCos and reducing HoldCo debt, with $450.00M of external debt prepaid. The leverage ratio of 1.40x was stable, indicating effective debt management. |
| Future financial performance projection | The company projects continued strong constant currency revenue growth and margin improvement for 2025, with capex guidance of $725.00M to $750.00M. The full impact of 2024's currency devaluations is expected to be reflected in 2025 reported figures, with an anticipated 50 bps further negative impact on EBITDA margin from Nigeria's reduced contribution. The focus remains on driving revenue growth, operating efficiencies, and strengthening the balance sheet through debt localization and shareholder returns. | The company anticipated sustained growth in 2024, with continued EBITDA margin resilience, despite ongoing inflationary pressures, currency devaluation, and repatriation risks. Capex outlook for 2024 was $800.00M to $825.00M, including investments in data centers and fiber businesses. The long-term opportunities in underpenetrated mobile and mobile money markets were expected to drive growth. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---------- | :---------- | :---------- |
| Market Risks | **Competition and Market Disruption:** The company operates in an increasingly competitive environment across its markets and segments, particularly concerning pricing and market share. Aggressive competition or the entry of new players could exert downward pressure on prices, negatively impacting revenue, margins, profitability, and long-term survival. The nature and intensity of competition vary across markets, products, and services. <br><br> **Geopolitical Risks and Adverse Macroeconomic Conditions:** Global geopolitical tensions and conflicts can directly and indirectly impact the business. Rising inflation and increased cost of living in some markets pressure consumer disposable income and increase business input costs, negatively affecting sales and profitability. <br><br> **Digitalization and Innovation:** Failure to innovate, simplify customer experience, and develop adequate digital touchpoints in line with evolving customer needs and the competitive landscape could lead to customer loss and market share erosion. Continuous innovation is required to simplify user experience, enhance business process agility, and develop more digital touchpoints to meet changing customer demands. | **Adverse Competition and Market Disruption:** The company operates in an increasingly competitive environment across its markets and segments, particularly with respect to pricing and market share. Aggressive competition by existing players or the entry of a new player could put downward pressure on prices, adversely affecting revenue, margins, profitability, and long-term survival. The nature and level of competition vary for each market, product, and service. <br><br> **Digitalization and Innovation:** Failure to innovate through simplifying the customer experience and developing adequate digital touchpoints in line with changing customer needs and the competitive landscape could lead to loss of customers and market share. The company needs to continually innovate to simplify user experience, make business processes more agile, and develop more digital touchpoints to reach customers and meet their changing needs. |
| Operational Risks | **Cyber and Information Security Threats:** The company is increasingly exposed to cybersecurity threats from internal or external sabotage or system vulnerabilities, potentially leading to customer data breaches and/or service downtimes. Cybercrime techniques, including distributed denial-of-service attacks, could disrupt key operations, hinder critical service recovery, and damage assets. <br><br> **Increase in Cost Structure:** Adverse changes in the external business environment and/or supply chain processes could significantly increase operating costs and negatively impact profitability. Operating costs are subject to supply chain risks, including fluctuations in global commodity prices, market uncertainty, energy costs (e.g., diesel and electricity), and the cost of obtaining and maintaining licenses, spectrum, and other regulatory requirements. Macroeconomic conditions, such as rising global inflation and the impact of geopolitical events on commodity prices, also contribute to this risk. <br><br> **Leadership Succession Planning:** The company needs to continuously identify and develop successors for key leadership positions to ensure minimal disruption to strategy execution. A shortage of skilled telecommunications professionals in some operating countries means failure to recruit, train, integrate, retain, and motivate key skilled employees could materially affect the business, operations, financial condition, and prospects. <br><br> **Technology Resilience and Business Continuity:** The ability to provide quality of service (QoS) depends on the robustness and resilience of the technology stack and ecosystem, encompassing hardware, software, products, services, and applications, and the ability to respond appropriately to disruptions. Telecommunications networks are subject to risks of technical failures, aging infrastructure, human error, willful acts of destruction, or natural disasters, including equipment failures, energy/fuel shortages, software errors, fiber damage, lack of redundancy, and inadequate disaster recovery plans. | **Technology Obsolescence:** An inability to effectively and efficiently invest in and upgrade the network and IT infrastructure would affect the company's ability to compete effectively. While continuous investment is made to improve and maintain networks and IT systems for current volume and capacity growth, substantial capital is needed to keep pace with rapid technological changes and the competitive landscape. <br><br> **Cyber and Information Security Threats:** The company is increasingly exposed to cybersecurity threats from internal or external sabotage or system vulnerabilities, potentially resulting in customer data breaches and/or service downtimes.

A shortage of skilled telecommunications professionals in some operating countries means failure to recruit, train, integrate, retain, and motivate key skilled employees could materially affect the business, operations, financial condition, and prospects. <br><br> **Internal Controls and Compliance:** Gaps in internal control and compliance could affect reputation and lead to financial losses. Financial reporting is subject to risks of inadequate controls due to changing conditions, new accounting requirements, or reporting delays/inaccuracies. <br><br> **Network Resilience and Business Continuity:** The ability to provide quality of service (QoS) depends on the robustness and resilience of the network and IT infrastructure and the ability to respond appropriately to disruptions. Telecommunications networks are subject to risks of technical failures, aging infrastructure, human error, willful acts of destruction, or natural disasters, including equipment failures, energy/fuel shortages, software errors, fiber damage, lack of redundancy, and inadequate disaster recovery plans. |
| Financial Risks | **Exchange Rate Fluctuations and Shortage of Foreign Currency:** The multinational footprint exposes the company to adverse currency fluctuations and macroeconomic conditions. Revenue and costs are incurred in local currencies, but foreign currency costs arise from equipment and service purchases. Adverse exchange rate movements between OpCo currencies and the US dollar could negatively affect liquidity and financial condition. Limited foreign currency supply in some markets impacts timely foreign currency vendor payments and the ability to fully benefit from strong cash generation by OpCos. <br><br> **Impact of 1% USD Appreciation (12-month basis):** <br> - Across all OpCo currencies: -$45m to -$47m on revenues, -$21m to -$22m on EBITDA, and -$21m to -$23m on foreign exchange losses (excluding derivatives). <br> - For Nigerian Naira: -$10m to -$11m on revenues, -$5m to -$6m on EBITDA, and -$8.5m to -$10.5m on foreign exchange losses (excluding derivatives). | **Exchange Rate Fluctuations and Shortage of Foreign Currency:** The multinational footprint exposes the company to adverse currency fluctuations and macroeconomic conditions.
