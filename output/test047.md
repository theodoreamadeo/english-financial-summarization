# Section 3: Business Analysis

## 3.1 Profitability Analysis

| Perspective | Answer |
| :---------- | :----- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | In 2024, CBL & Associates Properties, Inc. experienced a decrease in total revenues to $515,561 thousand from $535,286 thousand in 2023, representing a decline of 3.68%. This was primarily driven by a $20,081 thousand decrease in rental revenues, which fell from $513,957 thousand in 2023 to $493,876 thousand in 2024. The decrease in rental revenues was attributed to lower minimum rents, percentage rents, and tenant reimbursements. Minimum rents were impacted by tenant closures and conversions to percentage-in-lieu-of-rent agreements. Percentage rents declined due to lower tenant sales compared to the prior year. Tenant reimbursements were lower due to accruals of credits to tenants related to reduced assessments and successful appeals of real estate taxes. Additionally, property dispositions and deconsolidations (Layton Hills properties, Alamance Crossing East, and WestGate Mall) contributed $9,800 thousand to the decrease in rental revenues. Management, development, and leasing fees saw a slight decrease of $308 thousand, from $7,917 thousand in 2023 to $7,609 thousand in 2024. Other revenues, however, increased by $664 thousand, from $13,412 thousand in 2023 to $14,076 thousand in 2024. The distribution of revenues by property type remained relatively stable, with Malls contributing 70.00% in 2024 (down from 71.40% in 2023), Outlet Centers increasing to 5.50% (from 5.00%), Lifestyle Centers remaining stable at 7.80% (from 7.70%), Open-Air Centers increasing to 11.00% (from 10.50%), and All Other Properties increasing to 5.70% (from 5.40%). |

## 3.1.2 Operating Efficiency

| Perspective | Answer |
| :---------- | :----- |
| Operating Efficiency | The company's operating efficiency improved in 2024 compared to 2023, as total operating expenses decreased by $55,489 thousand, from $439,621 thousand in 2023 to $384,132 thousand in 2024. This reduction occurred despite a decrease in total revenues, indicating better cost management. Property operating expenses decreased by $944 thousand, from $90,996 thousand in 2023 to $90,052 thousand in 2024. This was primarily due to a state franchise tax rebate and lower real estate taxes, as well as reduced janitorial and security costs. Property dispositions and deconsolidations contributed $3,800 thousand to this decrease. Real estate taxes decreased by $7,442 thousand, from $54,807 thousand in 2023 to $47,365 thousand in 2024, largely due to reduced assessments and successful appeals. Maintenance and repairs also decreased by $3,604 thousand, from $41,336 thousand in 2023 to $37,732 thousand in 2024. Depreciation and amortization saw a significant decrease of $49,914 thousand, from $190,505 thousand in 2023 to $140,591 thousand in 2024, mainly because tenant improvement and intangible in-place lease assets recognized upon fresh start accounting became fully depreciated or amortized. General and administrative expenses, however, increased by $3,188 thousand, from $64,066 thousand in 2023 to $67,254 thousand in 2024, primarily due to higher compensation and share-based compensation expenses. The operating margin, calculated as (Total Revenues - Total Expenses) / Total Revenues, improved from 17.15% in 2023 to 25.50% in 2024, reflecting enhanced operational performance despite the revenue decline. |

## 3.1.3 External & One-Off Impact

| Perspective | Answer |
| :---------- | :----- |
| Effective Tax Rate, Non-Recurring Items | The effective tax rate for CBL & Associates Properties, Inc. was 1.85% in 2024, calculated as Income Tax Provision ($1,055 thousand) divided by Net Income ($57,117 thousand). This is a decrease from 27.89% in 2023, where the Income Tax Provision was $894 thousand and Net Income was $3,204 thousand. The significant change in the effective tax rate is influenced by the relatively low net income in 2023 and the higher net income in 2024. <br><br> Several non-recurring items significantly impacted profitability in both years. In 2024, the company recognized a $26,727 thousand gain on consolidation related to the acquisition of its partner's 50% joint venture interests in Cool Springs Galleria, Oak Park Mall, and West County Center. Additionally, there was a $16,676 thousand gain on sales of real estate assets from the disposition of Layton Hills Mall, Layton Hills Convenience Center, Layton Hills Plaza, and other parcels. A loss on impairment of $1,461 thousand was recorded in 2024. Litigation settlement resulted in a credit of $553 thousand in 2024, compared to $2,310 thousand in 2023, indicating a reduction in expense. <br><br> In 2023, the company recorded a $47,879 thousand gain on deconsolidation related to Alamance Crossing East and WestGate Mall, which were placed into receivership. A gain on extinguishment of debt of $3,270 thousand was recognized in 2023, related to a reduction in the outstanding principal of the loan secured by The Outlet Shoppes at Laredo. The gain on sales of real estate assets in 2023 was $5,125 thousand. These non-recurring gains significantly boosted net income in 2023, making the year-over-year comparison of net income less straightforward without considering these one-off events. |

## 3.2 Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---------- | :---------- | :---------- |
| Comprehensive financial health | The company's financial health showed improvement in 2024. Total assets increased by 14.19% to $2,747,191 thousand from $2,405,905 thousand in 2023. This growth was primarily driven by an increase in net investment in real estate assets, which rose by 18.29% to $1,871,492 thousand.

Shareholders' equity decreased by 8.42% to $339,321 thousand. The current ratio (Current Assets / Current Liabilities) is N/A due to lack of detailed current liability breakdown. The debt-to-equity ratio (Total Debt / Total Equity) was 5.71 in 2023, indicating a high reliance on debt financing. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Net income significantly improved in 2024, reaching $57,117 thousand, a substantial increase from $3,204 thousand in 2023. Net income attributable to common shareholders also rose to $57,764 thousand from $5,433 thousand. The net profit margin (Net Income / Total Revenues) was 11.08% in 2024, a significant improvement from 0.60% in 2023. Earnings per share (EPS) increased to $1.87 from $0.17. The effective tax rate was 1.85% in 2024, compared to 27.89% in 2023. The quality of earnings was influenced by non-recurring items, including a $26,727 thousand gain on consolidation and a $16,676 thousand gain on sales of real estate assets. | Net income was $3,204 thousand in 2023, a significant improvement from a net loss of $(99,515) thousand in 2022. Net income attributable to common shareholders was $5,433 thousand, up from $(96,019) thousand. The net profit margin (Net Income / Total Revenues) was 0.60% in 2023, a notable improvement from -17.68% in 2022. EPS was $0.17 in 2023, compared to $(3.20) in 2022. The effective tax rate was 27.89% in 2023. Earnings quality was impacted by a $47,879 thousand gain on deconsolidation and a $3,270 thousand gain on extinguishment of debt, which are non-recurring. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency improved in 2024. Total operating expenses decreased by 12.60% to $384,132 thousand, while total revenues decreased by 3.68% to $515,561 thousand. This led to an improved operating margin (Operating Income / Total Revenues) of 25.50% in 2024, up from 17.15% in 2023. Property operating expenses decreased by 1.04%, real estate taxes decreased by 13.58%, and maintenance and repairs decreased by 8.79%. Depreciation and amortization significantly decreased by 26.20%, reflecting assets becoming fully depreciated. General and administrative expenses increased by 4.97%, indicating some pressure on overhead costs. | Operational efficiency showed mixed results in 2023. Total operating expenses decreased by 14.83% to $439,621 thousand, while total revenues decreased by 4.93% to $535,286 thousand. The operating margin (Operating Income / Total Revenues) was 17.15% in 2023, an improvement from 8.34% in 2022. Property operating expenses decreased by 1.23%, real estate taxes decreased by 4.05%, and maintenance and repairs decreased by 2.69%. Depreciation and amortization significantly decreased by 25.54%, contributing to the overall reduction in expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased by 4.69%, indicating some cost control. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | The company's financial risk profile appears to be high due to a high debt-to-equity ratio of 7.07 in 2024. While total debt increased, the company actively managed its debt portfolio through paydowns and modifications. The weighted-average remaining term of total debt was 2.4 years, indicating significant short-to-medium term refinancing needs. Variable-rate debt constituted 34.50% of total debt, exposing the company to interest rate fluctuations. A 0.50% increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately $4,700 thousand. The company's liquidity position, with $283,900 thousand in unrestricted cash and U.S. Treasury securities, provides some buffer against these risks. | The company faced significant financial risks in 2023, with a high debt-to-equity ratio of 5.71. The total pro rata share of debt was $2,656,348 thousand. A substantial portion of debt was maturing in the short term, with $106,800 thousand in 2024, $288,100 thousand in 2025, and $710,100 thousand in 2026. Variable-rate debt represented 40.40% of total debt, making the company vulnerable to interest rate increases. A 0.50% increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately $5,400 thousand. The company's liquidity, with $296,300 thousand in unrestricted cash and U.S. Treasury securities, was crucial for managing these obligations. |
| Future financial performance projection | The company's future financial performance is projected to be influenced by its strategy to improve occupancy, drive rent growth, and transform property offerings. The acquisition of joint venture interests in key malls and the sale of non-core properties indicate a focus on portfolio optimization. The declaration of a special dividend in 2025 suggests confidence in meeting REIT distribution requirements. However, continued high debt levels and exposure to variable interest rates remain key challenges. The ability to refinance maturing debt and manage operating expenses will be critical for sustained profitability and cash flow generation. | The company's future financial performance in 2023 was heavily influenced by its balance sheet strategy, focusing on debt reduction and maturity extension. The successful extension and refinancing of several loans, along with the elimination of a limited guaranty on the secured term loan, reduced immediate financial pressures. However, the deconsolidation of properties due to receivership highlights ongoing challenges in managing underperforming assets. The company's ability to maintain occupancy rates and control operating expenses will be crucial for improving cash flow and supporting future dividend payments. |

## 3.3 Business Competitiveness

| Field | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---------- | :---------- |
| Business Model | CBL & Associates Properties, Inc. operates as a self-managed, self-administered, fully integrated real estate investment trust (REIT). Its primary business model involves the ownership, development, acquisition, leasing, management, and operation of regional shopping malls, outlet centers, lifestyle centers, open-air centers, and other properties (office buildings, outparcels, and hotels). The company generates revenue primarily from leases with retail tenants, which include fixed minimum rents, percentage rents based on sales volumes, and reimbursements for real estate taxes, insurance, and common area maintenance (CAM). Additional revenue streams come from management, leasing, and development fees, sponsorships, and sales of peripheral land and operating real estate assets. The company's strategy focuses on maximizing long-term value by increasing Net Operating Income (NOI) and free cash flow through internal growth (contractual rent increases, new tenants, tenant mix enhancement, expense control, ancillary revenues), asset densification (non-retail projects on unused land), and active portfolio management (identifying and divesting non-strategic assets, selective acquisitions). A key aspect of its model is the re-tenanting of former anchor locations with diverse uses like entertainment, fitness, and dining to enhance property value and traffic. | CBL & Associates Properties, Inc. operates as a self-managed, self-administered, fully integrated real estate investment trust (REIT).

| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The report highlights that inflationary pressures pose risks to the company's business, tenants, and the U.S. economy. Inflationary price increases could adversely affect consumer spending, impacting tenant sales and their ability to pay rent. It also notes that inflation has caused increases in operating expenses, which could raise occupancy costs for tenants and, if unrecoverable, increase the company's operating expenses. Rising interest rates due to inflation negatively impact consumer spending, tenant investment decisions, and increase borrowing costs for variable-rate debt or future debt. A deterioration of capital and credit markets could affect the company's ability to access funds for refinancing or new debt. | The report highlights that inflationary pressures pose risks to the company's business, tenants, and the U.S. economy.

| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces | The company faces competition from various shopping facilities in attracting retailers and from online shopping alternatives, discount centers, outlet centers, wholesale clubs, and television shopping networks. The evolving relationship among customers, retailers, and shopping centers due to new technologies, such as omni-channel retailing, may make the company's properties less desirable if it cannot adapt. Increased online shopping could lead to store closures and impact occupancy levels and rental rates. The company also competes with other major real estate investors for attractive investment opportunities, which could impair its ability to acquire, develop, or redevelop properties and attract key retailers on favorable terms. | The company faces competition from various shopping facilities in attracting retailers and from online shopping alternatives, discount centers, outlet centers, wholesale clubs, and television shopping networks.
