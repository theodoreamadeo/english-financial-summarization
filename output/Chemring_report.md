# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue increased by 8.00% from £472.60 million in 2023 to £510.40 million in 2024. This growth was primarily driven by strong performance at Roke (up 17.00%) and growth in niche Energetics businesses (up 12.00%), partially offset by a weaker year for Countermeasures. <br><br>The gross margin for the Group is not explicitly provided in the reports. However, the underlying operating profit margin decreased from 14.60% in 2023 to 13.90% in 2024. This decline primarily reflects the impact of operational challenges at the Tennessee countermeasures business and the lower margin legacy US Government contract in 2024. <br><br>Revenue distribution by product/service in 2024 was £339.40 million from Goods and £171.00 million from Services, compared to £318.60 million from Goods and £154.00 million from Services in 2023. This indicates a 6.53% increase in Goods revenue and a 10.00% increase in Services revenue. <br><br>Geographically, the UK remained the largest market, with revenue increasing from £202.20 million in 2023 to £229.20 million in 2024 (13.35% growth). US revenue decreased from £181.80 million in 2023 to £172.60 million in 2024 (-5.06%). Europe revenue increased from £71.30 million in 2023 to £86.00 million in 2024 (20.62% growth). Asia Pacific revenue increased from £15.90 million in 2023 to £16.70 million in 2024 (5.03% growth). Rest of the world revenue increased from £1.40 million in 2023 to £5.90 million in 2024 (321.43% growth). |
| Operating Efficiency | The Group's operating efficiency, as measured by underlying operating profit margin, decreased from 14.60% in 2023 to 13.90% in 2024. This decline is attributed to operational challenges at the Tennessee countermeasures business and the impact of a lower margin legacy US government contract. <br><br>Underlying operating profit increased from £69.20 million in 2023 to £71.10 million in 2024, representing a 2.75% increase. Statutory operating profit, however, saw a more significant increase of 28.00%, from £45.40 million in 2023 to £58.10 million in 2024. This larger increase in statutory operating profit is due to a reduction in non-underlying costs in 2024 compared to 2023. <br><br>Operating expenses are not explicitly detailed in a consolidated manner that allows for a direct year-over-year comparison of total operating expenses. However, staff costs increased from £176.60 million in 2023 to £196.10 million in 2024 (11.04% increase), and the cost of inventories recognized as an expense increased from £146.50 million in 2023 to £165.30 million in 2024 (12.83% increase). These increases in direct costs outpaced revenue growth, contributing to the slight decrease in underlying operating margin. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate on underlying profit before tax increased from 15.00% in 2023 to 18.60% in 2024. This increase reflects the full-year effect of the increase in the UK corporation tax rate and an increased weighting of UK profit. The statutory effective tax rate also increased from 14.50% in 2023 to 19.90% in 2024. <br><br>Non-recurring items significantly impacted profitability in both years, but with a notable shift in their nature and magnitude. In 2023, non-underlying items totaled £23.80 million, primarily driven by a £18.50 million impairment of Chemical Detection assets and £3.70 million in acquisition expenses. In 2024, non-underlying items decreased to £13.00 million. This included a £7.50 million expense for defined benefit pension buy-in and buy-out transactions, £3.40 million in acquisition expenses, and a £2.00 million loss on derivative financial instruments, partially offset by a £3.10 million release of legal and disposal provisions. The tax impact of non-underlying items was a £3.80 million credit in 2023 and a £1.70 million credit in 2024. The significant impairment charges in 2023 made the non-underlying impact much larger in that year, leading to a lower statutory operating profit despite a higher underlying profit. |

## S3.2: Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | The Group's financial health remained robust, with total assets increasing to £692.10 million from £596.40 million in 2023 (16.05% growth). Total equity decreased slightly to £356.30 million from £378.50 million in 2023 (-5.90%), primarily due to share buybacks and dividends paid. Net debt increased to £52.80 million from £14.40 million in 2023 (266.67% increase), driven by significant capital investments and share buybacks. The net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio increased to 0.56 times from 0.16 times in 2023, remaining well below the internal target of <1.5 times. Cash and cash equivalents increased significantly to £45.00 million from £6.40 million in 2023 (603.13% increase). | The Group demonstrated solid financial health, with total assets of £596.40 million. Total equity was £378.50 million. Net debt was £14.40 million, representing a net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio of 0.16 times, indicating a very low leverage. Cash and cash equivalents were £6.40 million. |
| Profitability and earnings quality | Profitability showed mixed results. Underlying operating profit increased by 2.75% to £71.10 million, but the underlying diluted EPS decreased by 3.50% to 19.30p, reflecting higher effective tax rates and finance costs. Statutory operating profit, however, increased significantly by 28.00% to £58.10 million, and statutory basic EPS from continuing operations increased by 17.16% to 15.70p, due to lower non-underlying costs compared to 2023. The quality of earnings was impacted by non-underlying items, including pension buy-in costs and acquisition expenses. | Profitability was strong, with underlying operating profit increasing by 16.00% to £69.20 million and underlying diluted EPS increasing by 8.00% to 20.00p. Statutory operating profit decreased by 8.00% to £45.40 million, and statutory basic EPS from continuing operations decreased by 15.19% to 13.40p, largely due to significant non-underlying impairment charges related to Chemical Detection assets (£18.50 million) and discontinued operations (£31.40 million). The effective tax rate on underlying profit before tax was 15.00%. |
| Operational efficiency | Operational efficiency, as measured by the underlying operating profit margin, slightly decreased from 14.60% in 2023 to 13.90% in 2024. This was primarily due to operational challenges in the Countermeasures business and lower-margin legacy contracts. Underlying cash conversion remained strong at 102.00% (up from 90.00% in 2023), with a 36-month rolling average of 101.00%, demonstrating effective working capital management. Inventory increased to £127.10 million from £101.70 million in 2023 (24.97% increase), reflecting efforts to secure supply chains for increased demand. | Operational efficiency was high, with an underlying operating profit margin of 14.60%, achieving the mid-teens objective. Underlying cash conversion was 90.00%, with a 36-month rolling average of 101.00%, indicating strong cash generation from operations. Inventory increased to £101.70 million from £99.60 million in 2022 (2.11% increase), reflecting procurement for anticipated demand. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | The increase in net debt to £52.80 million and the net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio to 0.56 times indicate a higher, but still manageable, financial risk. The Group secured an £80.00 million Export Finance backed loan, increasing total accessible funding to £246.00 million, providing ample liquidity. Compliance with banking covenants (leverage ratio 0.56x vs <1.5x target, interest cover ratio 15.28x vs >4x target) remained strong. The defined benefit pension scheme surplus was £0.10 million, down from £5.90 million in 2023, following a buy-in contract. | Financial risk was low, with net debt at £14.40 million and a net debt to underlying EBITDA ratio of 0.16 times, well within covenant limits. The defined benefit pension scheme had a surplus of £5.90 million. The Group had £142.90 million in undrawn borrowing facilities. |
| Future financial performance projection | The outlook is strong, supported by a record order book of £1,038.00 million, providing 77.00% coverage for 2025 revenue. Significant investments of £200.00 million in Energetics capacity expansion (subsidized by £90.00 million in grants) are expected to generate an additional £100.00 million in annual revenue and £30.00 million in operating profit by 2028. The Group aims for £1.00 billion in annual revenue by 2030. The focus on balancing short-term performance with long-term growth and value creation is expected to continue. | The outlook was strong, with a record order book of £922.00 million, providing 79.00% cover for 2024 revenue. A £120.00 million capacity expansion plan in Energetics was initiated, expected to generate £85.00 million in incremental revenue and £21.00 million in operating profit per annum from 2026/27. The Group aimed to double its value over the next five years. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## 4.1 Risk Factors

### 4.1.1. Market Risks

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Conditions & Competition | The global defence market's future appears increasingly robust, with expectations for strong and sustained growth over at least the next decade. However, economic pressures may continue to place defence spend under pressure. The Group is well positioned in niche segments of the defence, national security, and space markets, which have the opportunity to outperform their broader sectors. | Defence spending depends on a complex mix of political considerations, fiscal constraints, and the requirements of the armed forces. Overall defence spending may therefore be subject to significant yearly fluctuations and there may also be downward pressure on defence budgets in certain key programme areas. The Group's financial performance may be adversely impacted by lower defence spending by its major customers, either generally or in relation to certain programmes. |
| Order Intake & Contract Delays | The Group's profits and cash flows are dependent, to a significant extent, on the timing of award of defence contracts. In general, the majority of the Group's contracts are of a relatively short duration and, with the exception of framework contracts with key customers, do not cover multi-year requirements. Unmitigated delays in the receipt of orders or cancellation of existing contracts could affect the Group's financial performance. If the Group's businesses are unable to continue trading profitably during periods of lower order intake, financial performance will deteriorate, and assets may be impaired. | The Group's profits and cash flows are dependent, to a significant extent, on the timing of award of defence contracts.
