# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---------- | :---------- | :---------- |
| Market Risks | The global economy in 2024 was characterized by high uncertainty and rapid dynamics, including geopolitical tensions (Russia-Ukraine conflict, Israel-Palestine attacks), inflationary pressures, and monetary policy adjustments. These factors created significant pressure on global markets, weakening economic resilience and hampering growth. The property industry in Indonesia, while showing positive growth, faced challenges such as rising construction costs, licensing issues, and interest rates. The Company's strategy of product and geographic diversification, focusing on landed residential products for end-users and upper-middle income segments, aims to mitigate these risks by leveraging domestic growth opportunities and enhancing brand recognition. However, market demand for certain segments, like office rentals, remained unrecovered. | The global economy in 2023 was challenging due to geopolitical tensions (Russia-Ukraine war, Middle East conflict), the El Nino phenomenon, climate change affecting commodity prices, and inflation impacting monetary policies. These factors contributed to high global economic uncertainty. The Indonesian property industry, despite government stimuli (e.g., VAT incentives, relaxed LTV/FTV ratios), faced low demand due to rising interest rates and weakened economic activity. The Company's strategy focused on leveraging positive growth momentum through product and geographic diversification, particularly in landed residential, to mitigate these market challenges. |
| Operational Risks | The Company faces operational risks related to its extensive project portfolio across 34 cities, requiring effective project planning, development, construction, and sales. Dependence on independent contractors for construction introduces risks related to quality, timely completion, and financial stability of these partners. The expansion into new projects and clusters, while driving pre-sales, also increases operational complexity. The Company's commitment to sustainable development and green building concepts introduces additional operational considerations and potential costs. Human resource management, including attracting and retaining talent, is crucial for operational success. | Operational risks for the Company in 2023 included managing a diverse portfolio of over 87 projects across 34 cities. Challenges in project planning, development, and construction, particularly with independent contractors, could impact quality and timely delivery. The expansion into new projects and clusters, while contributing to pre-sales, also increased operational complexity. Human resource management, including training and retention, was a continuous effort to ensure a skilled workforce. |
| Financial Risks | The Company's financial risks include fluctuations in revenue recognition from residential and commercial segments, particularly due to the application of PSAK 115 (Financial Income as an Impact of Significant Funding Components). Exposure to interest rate changes on variable-rate bank loans and foreign exchange rate fluctuations (US$ and SG$) on debt instruments (e.g., Notes 2026) pose significant financial risks. The increase in capital expenditures, especially for land acquisition and fixed assets, requires careful financial management. The legal cases involving a subsidiary (PT Citra Swadaya Raya) could also lead to financial liabilities or reputational damage. | The Company faced financial risks in 2023 from fluctuations in revenue recognition, particularly due to the application of PSAK 72 (financial income as an impact of significant funding components). Exposure to interest rate changes on variable-rate bank loans and foreign exchange rate fluctuations (US$ and SG$) on debt instruments (e.g., Notes 2026) were key financial risks. The increase in capital expenditures, especially for land acquisition and fixed assets, required careful financial management. Legal cases involving a subsidiary (PT Citra Swadaya Raya) posed potential financial liabilities and reputational damage. |
| Compliance Risks | The Company is subject to various regulatory compliance risks, including OJK regulations, tax laws, and environmental standards. Changes in accounting policies (PSAK amendments) and tax regulations (e.g., Global Minimum Tax) require continuous monitoring and adaptation. Legal cases, such as those involving PT Citra Swadaya Raya, highlight the risks associated with contractual disputes and potential non-compliance. Adherence to corporate governance principles, including ethical behavior, accountability, transparency, and sustainability, is crucial to avoid reputational damage and regulatory penalties. | The Company faced compliance risks in 2023 related to OJK regulations, tax laws, and environmental standards.
