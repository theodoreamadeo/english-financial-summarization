# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Perspective | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Revenue increased from S$285.05 million in 2023 to S$295.52 million in 2024, representing a growth of 3.67%. This growth was primarily driven by the hospitality segment, which saw an increase in revenue from S$97.25 million in 2023 to S$105.91 million in 2024, a 8.91% increase. The commercial segment also contributed to revenue growth, rising from S$187.80 million in 2023 to S$189.61 million in 2024, a 0.96% increase. <br><br>Property operating expenses increased from S$50.09 million in 2023 to S$61.49 million in 2024, a 22.76% increase. This led to a slight decrease in Net Property Income (NPI) from S$234.97 million in 2023 to S$234.04 million in 2024, a 0.39% decline. The NPI margin decreased from 82.43% in 2023 to 79.20% in 2024. The decline in NPI was primarily due to an upward revision of prior years' property tax for Hilton Singapore Orchard and Crowne Plaza Changi Airport. Adjusting for this tax revision, NPI would have increased by 2.30% YoY. <br><br>Revenue contribution by segment in 2024 was 49.10% from Office, 33.70% from Hospitality, and 17.20% from Retail. In 2023, the contribution was 50.50% from Office, 32.20% from Hospitality, and 17.30% from Retail. The divestment of Lippo Plaza in December 2024 means that all of OUE REIT's commercial and hospitality assets are now located in Singapore. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating expenses, excluding property operating expenses, increased from S$19.16 million in 2023 to S$18.42 million in 2024, a 3.84% decrease. This includes Manager's management fees, Trustee's fee, and other expenses. <br><br>Net income (before share of joint venture results, fair value changes, and tax) decreased from S$103.90 million in 2023 to S$102.50 million in 2024, a 1.35% decline. This was primarily due to the slight decrease in NPI and an increase in net finance costs. <br><br>The operating margin (Net Income / Revenue) decreased from 36.45% in 2023 to 34.68% in 2024. This indicates a slight decrease in operating efficiency, mainly influenced by the higher property operating expenses and increased finance costs, despite the revenue growth. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate for the Group increased significantly from 1.19% in 2023 to 25.29% in 2024. This substantial increase was primarily driven by a significant rise in withholding tax from S$0.96 million in 2023 to S$33.27 million in 2024, and a decrease in deferred tax credit from S$10.02 million in 2023 to S$32.85 million in 2024. <br><br>Non-recurring items affecting profitability in 2024 include a loss on disposal of a subsidiary (Lippo Plaza) of S$26.43 million and a net change in fair value of investment properties resulting in a loss of S$153.57 million, compared to a gain of S$87.47 million in 2023. The share of joint venture results increased from S$16.89 million in 2023 to S$30.48 million in 2024, mainly due to fair value gains. <br><br>The amount to be distributed to Unitholders decreased marginally from S$115.31 million in 2023 to S$113.66 million in 2024, a 1.43% decline. This includes a release of S$5.00 million capital distribution from the divestment of OUE Bayfront in 2024, which was not present in 2023. |

| Profitability and earnings quality | Total return for the year decreased significantly from a profit of S$205.78 million in 2023 to a loss of S$58.91 million in 2024. This was primarily driven by a net change in fair value of investment properties from a gain of S$87.47 million in 2023 to a loss of S$153.57 million in 2024, and a loss on disposal of a subsidiary of S$26.43 million in 2024.

Distribution per Unit (DPU) decreased from 2.09 cents in 2023 to 2.06 cents in 2024, a 1.44% decline. | Total return for the year decreased from S$287.68 million in 2022 to S$205.78 million in 2023, a 28.54% decline. This was mainly due to a lower net change in fair value of investment properties (S$139.73 million in 2022 vs S$87.47 million in 2023) and a decrease in share of joint venture results (S$37.11 million in 2022 vs S$16.89 million in 2023).

| Future financial performance projection | The divestment of Lippo Plaza in 2024 positions OUE REIT with a Singapore-centric portfolio, focusing on high-quality office, hospitality, and retail assets. This strategic realignment is expected to drive long-term growth and value. The successful refinancing of debt and inaugural issuance of Green Notes strengthen the capital structure, providing financial flexibility for future opportunities. The hospitality segment is expected to continue its strong performance, while the Singapore office market remains resilient. However, global macroeconomic uncertainties and elevated interest rates may pose challenges. | The full reopening of Hilton Singapore Orchard and the completion of asset enhancement initiatives at Crowne Plaza Changi Airport are expected to drive continued growth in the hospitality segment. The Singapore office market is anticipated to remain stable with positive rental reversions. The investment-grade credit rating and green financing framework enhance financial flexibility and access to capital. However, challenges in the Shanghai leasing market for Lippo Plaza and global economic uncertainties may impact overall performance. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## 4.1 Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | **Competition:** The real estate sector is highly competitive, with new market players and increased competition, particularly in the hospitality sector. This could lead to loss of market share and impact revenue. <br><br> **Economic Instability/Downturns:** Global macroeconomic challenges, geopolitical tensions, persistent inflation, and prolonged high interest rates create an uncertain operating environment. A subdued recovery in China's economy and potential escalations in trade disputes pose risks to global growth. This instability can adversely impact OUE REIT's operations, investment values, and tenant demand. <br><br> **Evolving Office Needs:** Global economic uncertainties and hybrid work trends weigh on occupier sentiment, leading to cautious spending on office relocations and expansions. While there is a "flight-to-quality" and "flight-to-green" trend, a slowdown in rental growth and potential increase in secondary spaces could impact office portfolio performance. <br><br> **Changing Consumer Preferences:** Evolving consumer behavior, with a shift towards personal fulfillment, versatility, and holistic well-being, impacts retail and hospitality segments. Travelers prioritize experiences over traditional expenditures, and consumers are moving towards "quiet luxury" brands and athleisure. Failure to adapt to these changes could affect retail tenant mix and hotel performance. <br><br> **Hospitality Market Correction:** While the hospitality segment has seen strong growth, the absence of mega concerts and large-scale MICE events in 2025 compared to 2024 could lead to a market correction. This may impact RevPAR and overall hospitality revenue. | **Competition:** Increased competition within the industry, particularly in the hospitality sector, and the entry of new market players, could lead to a loss of market share. <br><br> **Economic Instability/Downturns:** Geopolitical tensions, elevated interest rates, and the pressure of higher domestic costs contribute to macroeconomic uncertainties. A slower-than-expected economic recovery in China and a sluggish property market in Shanghai pose significant challenges. These factors can dampen business and consumer sentiment, affecting rental growth and property valuations. <br><br> **Flexible/Hybrid Working Arrangements and Office Decentralization:** While the impact in Singapore has been minimal compared to the US or Europe, these trends, coupled with the redevelopment of older properties into mixed-use developments with potentially fewer office spaces, could affect demand for traditional office spaces. <br><br> **Changing Consumption Patterns:** Evolving consumer behavior, including the growth of e-commerce, increased household spending, and a rising interest in health and wellness, influences retail and lifestyle choices. Retailers must adapt to omnichannel retailing, experiential retail, and the demand for specific product categories like athleisure. Failure to do so could impact retail tenant mix and sales. <br><br> **Shanghai Office Market Challenges:** The Shanghai leasing market faces significant challenges due to peak supply, weak demand, and competition from decentralized business districts. This leads to increased vacancy rates, reduced asking rents, and longer lease-up periods, impacting the performance of properties like Lippo Plaza. |
| Operational Risks | **Property Tax Revisions:** Upward revisions of prior years' property tax for Hilton Singapore Orchard and Crowne Plaza Changi Airport negatively impacted Net Property Income (NPI) in FY 2024. Such revisions can increase operating expenses and reduce profitability. <br><br> **Operating Expenses:** Higher operating expenses in the commercial segment contributed to a slight decrease in NPI. This indicates challenges in managing costs effectively, which can erode profit margins. <br><br> **Asset Enhancement Initiative (AEI) Risks:** While AEIs aim to improve asset value, there are inherent risks in execution, cost overruns, and achieving the projected returns. For example, the successful completion of AEI at Crowne Plaza Changi Airport is expected to generate additional income, but any delays or underperformance could impact financial results. <br><br> **Tenant Engagement and Retention:** Amid cautious leasing sentiment, maintaining high occupancy and achieving positive rental reversions requires proactive tenant engagement and flexible leasing strategies. Failure to meet evolving tenant needs or intense competition could lead to higher vacancy rates and lower rental income. <br><br> **Climate Change Physical Risks:** Direct impacts of extreme weather events (floods, storms, heat waves) could damage buildings and disrupt daily operations, leading to increased maintenance costs and potential revenue loss. | **Property Tax Revisions:** Upward revisions of property taxes for Hilton Singapore Orchard and Crowne Plaza Changi Airport impacted NPI. Such revisions increase operating costs and reduce profitability. <br><br> **Manpower Shortages:** Challenges such as manpower shortages in the retail and hospitality sectors can affect service quality and operational efficiency, leading to increased labor costs or reduced customer satisfaction. <br><br> **High Fit-out Costs:** High fit-out costs for office spaces can deter tenants from relocating or expanding, impacting leasing activity and potentially leading to longer vacancy periods. <br><br> **Climate Change Physical Risks:** The real estate sector is susceptible to physical risks like droughts, floods, heatwaves, or rising sea levels. These could damage properties and disrupt operations. <br><br> **Water Scarcity:** OUE REIT's properties are located in water-scarce regions (Singapore and Shanghai), posing a risk to hospitality assets that are water-intensive. Inefficient water management could impact business continuity and increase operational costs. <br><br> **Waste Generation:** The increasing rate of waste generation and the limited landfill capacity in Singapore pose environmental risks. Ineffective waste management practices could lead to higher disposal costs and regulatory penalties. |
| Financial Risks | **Elevated Interest Rates:** A "high-for-longer" interest rate environment increases finance costs, impacting distributable income and DPU. While hedging strategies are in place, prolonged high rates can still exert pressure on profitability. <br><br> **Finance Costs:** Finance costs increased by 13.9% YoY in FY 2024, moderating from 14.3% YoY in FY 2023. Despite proactive capital management, rising interest rates continue to impact the cost of debt. <br><br> **Valuation Declines:** The net change in fair value of investment properties resulted in a loss of S$153.57 million in FY 2024, compared to a gain of S$87.47 million in FY 2023. This significant decline in property values directly impacts net assets and Unitholders' funds. <br><br> **Loss on Disposal of Subsidiary:** The divestment of Lippo Plaza resulted in a loss of S$26.43 million, indicating that the sale was below its carrying value or incurred significant associated costs. This directly reduces total return for the year. <br><br> **Impairment Loss on Investments:** An impairment loss of S$43.66 million was recognized on investments in subsidiaries, indicating a reduction in the recoverable amount of these investments. This negatively impacts the Trust's financial position. <br><br> **Working Capital Retention:** Retention for working capital remained at S$5 million, which reduces the amount available for distribution to Unitholders. | **Elevated Interest Rates:** High interest rates increase finance costs, impacting distributable income and DPU. Despite hedging, prolonged high rates can pressure profitability. <br><br> **Finance Costs:** Finance costs increased significantly from S$81.97 million in 2022 to S$114.85 million in 2023, representing a 39.9% increase. This rise directly reduces net income and distributable amounts. <br><br> **Valuation Declines:** While overall portfolio value increased, the valuation of Lippo Plaza declined by 11.9% YoY, reflecting challenges in the Shanghai market. This can negatively impact asset values and overall portfolio performance. <br><br> **Reduced Share of Joint Venture Results:** The share of joint venture results from OUE Bayfront decreased by 54.5% to S$16.89 million, impacting total return. <br><br> **Working Capital Retention:** Increased capital distribution retention for working capital requirements to S$8 million reduces the amount available for distribution to Unitholders. <br><br> **Currency Risk:** Investments in China expose the Group to currency risk, as the conversion of Chinese Renminbi is subject to foreign exchange controls. Fluctuations in exchange rates could impact the value of assets and income. |
| Compliance Risks | **Regulatory Compliance:** Non-compliance with evolving regulations (e.g., environmental, data privacy, anti-money laundering) can result in significant financial penalties, operational disruptions, and reputational damage. The integration of climate-related risks into the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework and adherence to MAS guidelines are critical. <br><br> **Ethical Business Practices:** Failure to uphold ethical standards, including anti-bribery and anti-corruption policies, can lead to reputational damage, legal complications, and financial setbacks. <br><br> **Cybersecurity Threats:** Increased reliance on technology and digitalization exposes the company to cyber-attacks, which could jeopardize the security of confidential data, disrupt operations, and erode stakeholder trust. <br><br> **Tax Compliance:** Changes in tax laws or non-compliance with tax regulations can lead to increased tax liabilities and penalties. The Tax Transparency Ruling and its conditions must be met to avoid adverse tax assessments. | **Regulatory Compliance:** Non-compliance with evolving regulations, including those related to environmental standards, data privacy (PDPA), and anti-money laundering (AML)/countering the financing of terrorism (CFT), can lead to significant fines, legal issues, and reputational damage. <br><br> **Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Compliance:** An incident of non-compliance with the WSH Act in 2023 resulted in a fine, highlighting the risk of workplace accidents and the importance of stringent safety procedures. Such incidents can lead to financial penalties and reputational harm. <br><br> **Ethical Business Practices:** Fraud, bribery, and corruption can severely damage the company's reputation, financial stability, and stakeholder relationships. A zero-tolerance approach and clear policies are essential to mitigate these risks. <br><br> **Cybersecurity Threats:** The elevated threat of cyber-attacks poses risks to confidential data security, operational continuity, and stakeholder trust. Failure to maintain a resilient cybersecurity system can lead to data breaches and financial losses. <br><br> **Tax Compliance:** Adherence to tax laws and rulings, such as the Tax Transparency Ruling, is crucial to avoid adverse tax assessments and ensure predictable tax liabilities. |

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The 2024 report highlights persistent global macroeconomic challenges, including geopolitical tensions, persistent inflation, and prolonged high interest rates. The Ministry of Trade and Industry projects Singapore's GDP to grow between 1% and 3% in 2025, a slowdown from 4.0% in 2024. Inflationary pressures, coupled with potential impacts of higher tariffs and tax reductions, remain key risks to the global economy. The potential "slower and shallower" Fed rate cuts may weigh on the REITs sector. | The 2023 report notes that the global economic outlook remains uncertain due to slow economic growth, high interest rates, and ongoing geopolitical tensions. Inflation began to gradually decrease in 2023, but the Goods and Services Tax (GST) was raised from 8.0% to 9.0% in 2024, which could impact consumer spending. The report also mentions that the sluggish property market in China continues to weigh on the economy, and short-term business outlook remains uncertain. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces | The 2024 report mentions that the property's diminishing leasehold tenure and vintage building specifications had started to affect valuation and competitiveness, especially with the current oversupply in the Shanghai market, leading to the divestment of Lippo Plaza. In the Singapore office market, while demand for high-quality space remains, global economic uncertainties and elevated borrowing costs have influenced occupier sentiment, leading to more cautious expenditure on office relocations and expansions. The retail sector faces challenges such as manpower shortages, competition from e-commerce, and higher operating costs. | The 2023 report indicates that Shanghai's leasing market will remain challenging in 2024 due to peak supply, weak demand, and competition from decentralized business districts. In Singapore, the retail sector faces challenges such as manpower shortages, competition from e-commerce, and higher operating costs. The office market faces potential headwinds from softening global leasing demand and some new supply. |
