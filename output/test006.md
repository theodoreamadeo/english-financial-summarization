# Section 4: Risk Factors

## 4.1 Risk Factors

### 4.1.1. Market Risks

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Competition | The bakery landscape in Singapore will continue to evolve and remain competitive, with rising demand for innovative flavors, and convenient and value-for-money products. Gardenia Malaysia remains committed to being the market leader, despite the challenges in an increasingly competitive market. The foodservice channel in Australia is expected to remain quite tight, with strong pressure on pricing and service levels. | Gardenia Singapore continues to lead the local packaged bread industry amidst a challenging global inflationary environment, slower economic growth, and ongoing global uncertainties. Gardenia Malaysia focused on the performance of core products, expanding new business channels domestically and new export markets, achieving over RM1.3 billion in gross revenue despite a cautious consumer environment. |
| Market Demand | Consumers across all regions continue to endure lower purchasing power in a higher cost-of-living environment, leading to increased price sensitivity and a shift towards lower-value and smaller-sized products. In the Philippines, inflationary pressures impacted the fast-moving consumer goods ("FMCG") sector, causing a general decline in demand in the bread market as consumers reallocated resources towards rice. | Consumer sensitivity to product prices increased due to inflationary pressures and slowing economic growth, leading to shifts in household spending. Demand for out-of-home dining and revenge travel resulted in strong recovery performance across the Food Services and Aviation-related sectors in Singapore. |
| Economic Conditions | Global inflation rates have stabilized, with many regions experiencing disinflation, but the higher cost-of-living environment has persisted, influencing consumers' purchasing power and confidence. The Australian economy is expected to improve but with only modest growth, and low consumer confidence is anticipated to continue weighing on disposable income. | The global economy experienced gradual recovery, but growth was moderated by inflationary pressures and tighter financial conditions. The Malaysian economy saw declining inflation but consumers remained cautious due to a slower domestic economy, tighter labor market, and elevated prices. |
| Political Factors | Geopolitical uncertainties have not abated, with a new focus on the likelihood of higher and additional tariffs being imposed by some countries. | Ongoing global uncertainties, such as geopolitical tensions, continued to impact the business environment. |
| Impact on Company Prospects | The company anticipates continued challenges due to escalating geopolitical and trade tensions, increased cross-border travel impacting domestic spending, and competitive market evolution. These factors necessitate strategic adjustments to product and price mix, and continuous innovation to maintain market leadership and affordability. | The company faced challenges from inflationary pressures, higher raw material costs, and increased labor and utility expenses. These factors impacted profitability and required strategic price and product mix adjustments to maintain competitive positioning. |

| Supply Chain Disruptions | The Ben Foods Group navigated continued global supply chain challenges. The company conducted a supplier climate risk assessment for key ingredients to understand how operations can withstand and adapt to climate-related challenges, such as supply chain disruptions. | Bakers Maison Australia experienced a still disrupted supply chain not fully recovered from the pandemic's impact. A major national frozen food carrier and 3PL company went into liquidation, causing major disruptions to the national food supply chain. |
| Technology Failures | The company implements a Computer Anti-virus Policy, Internet Use Policy, and Email Use Policy to reduce the risk of damage to data and programs caused by malicious software and to ensure proper usage of IT resources. Regular technical restoration and IT disaster recovery exercises are conducted to ensure data availability and recoverability. | The company implements a Computer Anti-virus Policy, Internet Use Policy, and Email Use Policy to reduce the risk of damage to data and programs caused by malicious software and to ensure proper usage of IT resources. Regular technical restoration and IT disaster recovery exercises are performed on key operational and financial systems and data. |
| Human Resource Challenges | Labor costs rose by 1% in FY2024. Bakers Maison Australia faces strong cost pressures in areas such as labor, and a low unemployment rate in Australia creates retention issues. | A tight labor market and government measures, such as minimum wage increases in certain regions, drove the Group's labor costs up by 11%. Bakers Maison Australia experienced retention issues due to many unfulfilled positions and a low unemployment rate. |
| Climate Change Impact | Acute physical risks like changes in precipitation (increased flooding intensity/frequency), extreme temperature spells, and extreme weather (increased storm intensity/frequency) are projected to increase, potentially disrupting road access, causing factory shutdowns, and decreasing worker productivity. Chronic changes in average temperature will lead to increased cooling requirements and production delays. | Acute physical risks such as changes in precipitation (increased flooding intensity/frequency), extreme temperature spells, and extreme weather (increased storm intensity/frequency) are projected to increase, potentially disrupting road access, causing factory shutdowns, and decreasing worker productivity.

| Impact on Company Operations and Financial Performance | Operational disruptions from physical risks can result in significant decreases in revenue. Increased energy costs associated with GHG emissions and costs to transition to lower emissions technology can impact financial performance. Supplier physical and transition risks can affect raw material availability and cost, indirectly impacting QAF. | Operational disruptions from physical risks can result in significant decreases in revenue.
