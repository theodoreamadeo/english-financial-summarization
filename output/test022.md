# Section 3: Business Analysis

## 3.1 Profitability Analysis

| Perspective | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | In 2024, the company's revenue grew by 11.06% to £579.40 million from £521.70 million in 2023. This growth was primarily driven by organic growth of 5.00% and inorganic growth of 7.00%, with a 0.00% impact from constant currency movements. The gross margin remained stable at 51.83% in 2024, a slight increase from 51.22% in 2023. This stability indicates effective cost management despite revenue growth. Revenue distribution by product/service in 2024 showed recurring revenue at 89.16% (£516.60 million) and revenue recognized at a point in time at 10.84% (£62.80 million). In 2023, recurring revenue was 88.71% (£462.80 million) and point-in-time revenue was 11.29% (£58.90 million). Geographically, the UK remained the largest revenue contributor, growing by 10.90% to £458.90 million in 2024 from £413.80 million in 2023. Europe's revenue increased by 5.65% to £114.00 million in 2024 from £107.90 million in 2023, with a new "Rest of World" category contributing £6.50 million in 2024. |
| Operating Efficiency | The company's operating expenses increased by 4.90% to £210.00 million in 2024 from £200.20 million in 2023. However, profit from operations saw a significant increase of 34.78% to £95.60 million in 2024 from £71.50 million in 2023. The operating margin improved substantially to 16.50% in 2024 from 13.70% in 2023. This indicates improved cost management and operational performance, especially considering the absence of exceptional items in 2024 compared to £16.00 million in 2023. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to a 15.00% rise in expenses excluding R&D, depreciation, amortization, and exceptional items, driven by inflation and costs related to new ERP and HR systems. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased to 27.00% in 2024 from 25.00% in 2023. This rise is primarily due to the statutory UK tax rate increasing from 19.00% to 25.00% in April 2023, which had a full-year impact in 2024. Additionally, professional fees related to acquisitions that were not tax-deductible contributed to the higher effective tax rate. In 2024, there were no exceptional items, a significant change from 2023 which saw £16.00 million in exceptional items, including a £12.70 million impairment of intangible development costs and £3.30 million in restructuring costs. The absence of these non-recurring charges in 2024 positively impacted profitability. |

The company's capital allocation policy prioritizes growth, shareholder returns, and maintaining a robust capital base. | The company's financial risk profile was low, supported by a healthy net cash balance of £134.80 million and minimal borrowings of £1.70 million. The capital allocation policy focused on organic and inorganic growth, with a share buyback program of £35.00 million announced for 2024, indicating confidence in future cash flows and a commitment to shareholder returns. |
| Future financial performance projection | The outlook is highly positive, driven by strategic acquisitions (Coolwave, BrightCloud, Placetel, STARFACE) and a strong position in the growing European UCaaS market.

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## 4.1 Risk Factors

### 4.1.1. Market Risks

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---------- | :---------- | :---------- |
| Market Risks | **Competition and Market Share:** The company operates in a fast-moving market with evolving communication needs and technology. Slow responses to shifts in the competitive landscape, in terms of product, pricing, and service development, could lead to a decline in market share and negatively impact revenue growth. The market is seeing continued consolidation and convergence of UCaaS and CCaaS, with global technology giants investing heavily and incorporating AI. Gamma's ability to select the right market segments and distribute third-party products is crucial. <br> **Changing Customer Buying Behaviors:** Customer buying behaviors are changing, with businesses researching and procuring services in a wider range of ways. Failure to adapt to these changes and develop new routes to market could limit growth opportunities and allow competitors to gain market share. The rapid shift from SIP to UCaaS and the increasing demand for more complex communication solutions (e.g., hybrid working, AI, omnichannel) require Gamma to continuously expand and update its product portfolio. <br> **German Market Under-penetration:** While Germany is a significant opportunity due to its large market size and low cloud penetration, macro-economic issues in Germany could lead to lower short-term growth rates. <br> **PSTN Switch-off Delays:** Delays in the UK's PSTN switch-off have meant it has not driven growth as much as hoped, impacting the anticipated acceleration of UCaaS sales. | **Competition and Market Share:** The company faces an uncertain competitive landscape with market consolidation and advancing UCaaS and CCaaS product portfolios from global technology giants. Failure to maintain a competitive edge in product, pricing, and service development could negatively impact revenue growth and market position, leading to customer loss and a diluted addressable market. <br> **Changing Customer Buying Behaviors:** The inability to adapt to market changes and develop new routes to market could limit growth opportunities. Customer needs are becoming more complex due to hybrid working and new technologies (e.g., omnichannel, AI), and if Gamma fails to meet these demands, products may become unattractive, leading to lost revenue and market share. <br> **German Market Under-penetration:** The German cloud market is under-penetrated, presenting a significant growth opportunity, but market conditions in the Netherlands and Spain remain difficult due to high cloud PBX penetration and dominance by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), respectively. <br> **PSTN Switch-off:** The UK's PSTN switch-off by the end of 2025 requires businesses to move to alternative solutions, which is an opportunity for Gamma, but delays in migration to date have been noted. <br> **Hardware PBX to Cloud Migrations:** The expected trend of end-users migrating from hardware PBX to full UCaaS solutions has not occurred in volume, posing a risk if Gamma cannot effectively transition these customers to its cloud offerings. |

### 4.1.2. Operational Risks

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---------- | :---------- | :---------- |
| Operational Risks | **Unplanned Service Disruption:** Disruption to Gamma's services, such as network outages or data center failures, could lead to a loss of customer confidence. While redundant systems and disaster recovery plans are in place, extreme weather events (acute and chronic) could still impact operations, increasing energy costs for cooling and potentially causing service interruptions. <br> **Over-reliance on Single Supplier:** An over-reliance on any single supplier could lead to missed opportunities if supplier plans are misaligned with Gamma's core markets, or impact service delivery and credibility if a key supplier fails to perform. <br> **Inability to Attract and Retain Talent:** Gamma's strategic priorities depend on its employees. Failure to recruit, develop, and retain talent, particularly key individuals, could hinder the achievement of business objectives. Competition for skilled staff in areas like sales, DevOps, and IT Security remains significant. <br> **Acquisition Integration Challenges:** The company has been active in M&A, acquiring Coolwave, BrightCloud, Placetel, and STARFACE. The successful integration of these acquisitions, particularly in Europe, is crucial. Failure to integrate effectively could impede strategic goals and operational efficiency. | **Unplanned Service Disruption:** Disruption to Gamma's services, including network and data center operations, could result in a loss of customer confidence. Although comprehensive operational governance, business continuity planning, and a 24/7 crisis response framework are in place, extreme weather events (acute and chronic) pose risks to infrastructure and could lead to service interruptions and increased costs. <br> **Over-reliance on Single Supplier:** Over-reliance on a single supplier could lead to missed opportunities if supplier market-led plans are misaligned with Gamma's core markets, or impact the company's ability to deliver products and services if a key supplier fails to perform. <br> **Inability to Attract and Retain Talent:** The company's strategic priorities depend on its employees. Failure to recruit, develop, and retain talent, especially key personnel, could negatively impact the achievement of business objectives. Competition for staff in sales, software development, and finance remains significant. <br> **Acquisition Integration Challenges:** The company made two acquisitions in 2023 (Satisnet and EnableX) and one in early 2024 (Coolwave). The successful integration of these acquisitions is critical to achieving strategic goals. |

### 4.1.3. Financial Risks

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---------- | :---------- | :---------- |
| Financial Risks | **Macro-economic Headwinds:** Despite a slightly stronger macro-economic picture in the UK for most of 2024, a weakening in the final quarter suggests 2025 may be weaker. This could temper the rate of acceleration in growth, impacting revenue and profitability. <br> **Working Capital Fluctuations:** Cash generated by operations declined by 5% in 2024, primarily due to non-repeatable favorable working capital movements in 2023, resulting in a year-on-year outflow of £18.5m. This includes outflows related to trade and other receivables, trade and other payables, and provisions. <br> **Increased Taxation:** The effective tax rate increased to 27% in 2024 from 25% in 2023, following the UK statutory rate rising to 25% in April 2023. This higher tax rate, applied to increased profits, impacts net earnings. <br> **Acquisition Financing and Debt:** For the first time, the Group has taken on debt through a £130m Revolving Credit Facility to finance the STARFACE acquisition. This introduces leverage and associated interest costs, which could impact financial flexibility if not managed effectively. <br> **Foreign Exchange Risk:** Operations in Europe expose the Group to currency risk, leading to gains or losses on retranslation into Pounds Sterling. While currently considered insignificant, material future foreign currency transactions could introduce volatility. | **Macro-economic Headwinds:** The company experienced a softer economy in 2023, leading to elongated sales cycles and delayed buying decisions, which affected organic growth in the Enterprise business unit. While early signs in 2024 suggest some improvement, the economic climate may temper the rate of acceleration. <br> **Increased Taxation:** The effective tax rate increased to 25% in 2023 from 24% in 2022, primarily due to the increase in the UK statutory corporation tax rate to 25% in April 2023. This higher tax rate impacts net earnings and will have a continued annualized impact in 2024. <br> **Working Capital Fluctuations:** While cash generated by operations increased by 25% in 2023, this was largely due to favorable year-on-year working capital movements totaling £19.2m, including the unwind of prepayments and improved debtor days. These movements may not be repeatable, potentially impacting future cash generation. <br> **Acquisition Costs:** The total payment for acquisitions in 2023 was £30.5m, including repayment of acquired debt. While acquisitions drive growth, they require significant capital outlay and can impact cash flow. <br> **Foreign Exchange Risk:** Operations in Europe expose the Group to currency risk, leading to gains or losses on retranslation into Pounds Sterling. While currently considered insignificant, material future foreign currency transactions could introduce volatility. |

### 4.1.4. Compliance Risks

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---------- | :---------- | :---------- |
| Compliance Risks | **Legal and Regulatory Non-compliance:** The company operates in a regulated industry across multiple geographies. Changes in legislative or regulatory requirements (e.g., NIS2, CER legislation in Europe, Telecommunications Security Act) could lead to significant investment for compliance, reputational damage, and fines. Non-compliance could also put Gamma at a competitive disadvantage. <br> **Data Loss and Cyber Attacks:** The increasing amount of data crossing networks and its importance to businesses elevate the risk of data loss and cyber attacks. Sophisticated attacks, potentially driven by AI, could lead to significant reputational impact, commercial losses, and fines under regulations like GDPR. <br> **UK Corporate Governance Code Compliance:** The planned move to the Main Market in May 2025 will require compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, which entails stricter reporting and governance standards. Failure to meet these standards could impact investor confidence and reputation. <br> **ESG Regulatory Compliance:** Failure to proactively address climate change and comply with evolving ESG regulations (e.g., CSRD, ISSB sustainability disclosures) could result in reputational damage, fines, and reduced investment from environmentally conscious stakeholders. | **Legal and Regulatory Non-compliance:** The company operates in a regulated industry across all geographies. Decisions by legislative, regulatory, or judicial bodies could impact Gamma's activities, potentially leading to competitive disadvantage, significant reputational damage, and fines. Compliance with new legislation like the Network and Information Security Directive (NIS2) and Critical Entities Resilience (CER) in Europe, and the Telecommunications Security Act (TSA), requires additional investment. <br> **Data Loss and Cyber Attacks:** The increasing volume and importance of data, coupled with the growing sophistication of cyber threats, elevate the risk of data loss and cyber attacks. A major security incident could result in significant reputational damage, commercial impact, and potential fines under regulations like GDPR. <br> **ESG Regulatory Compliance:** Failure to proactively address climate change and comply with evolving ESG regulations (e.g., CSRD, ISSB sustainability disclosures) could result in reputational damage, fines, and reduced investment from environmentally conscious stakeholders. |

## S6.1: Strategic Direction

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) to expand market share | Gamma's M&A strategy focuses on extending geographic reach, gaining further scale in existing markets, and broadening its product offering. Recent acquisitions include Coolwave (voice enablement services in 20 countries), BrightCloud (contact center solutions), Placetel (German Cloud Communications), and STARFACE (German communication platforms). The company has increased investment in deal origination and execution capabilities. | Gamma's M&A strategy aims to expand its product and solution set, particularly in Europe, and to acquire new technologies. Recent acquisitions include Satisnet (cyber security services) and EnableX (Ericsson-LG's iPECS solution). The company is actively seeking acquisitions to improve its scale and market position in Germany. |
| Acquire new technologies | Gamma aims to acquire new technologies through partnerships with global technology companies like Cisco, Microsoft, and Amazon, and by developing its own solutions for less complex needs. The company is focusing on Cloud-based communication systems (UCaaS, CCaaS, CX), voice enablement (e.g., Microsoft Teams integration), and connectivity (broadband, fiber, ethernet, mobile, IoT). The acquisition of Coolwave extended voice enablement to 20 countries, and BrightCloud enhanced CX offerings. | Gamma's strategy involves adopting best-of-breed third-party solutions from technology giants like Microsoft, Amazon, and Cisco, while also developing its own proprietary IP for specific needs (e.g., PhoneLine+).

AI is also identified as an increasingly important role in communications. |
| Potential for organizational restructuring | The report mentions that the amount of integration activity due to M&A has been high, requiring significant effort from the Gamma team. It also notes that the company is continuously evolving to stay ahead in a fast-moving market, implying ongoing adjustments to its operations. | The report mentions a restructuring exercise in late 2023 following a strategic change to the UCaaS offering and the combining of German and Dutch senior leadership teams.
