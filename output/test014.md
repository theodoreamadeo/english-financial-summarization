# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Perspective | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | **Revenue Growth:** The company's revenue decreased by 3.80% from $3,581,375,403.00 in 2023 to $3,446,214,954.00 in 2024. This contrasts sharply with the previous period, where revenue decreased by 23.90% from $4,703,622,038.00 in 2022 to $3,581,375,403.00 in 2023. The decline in 2024 was primarily driven by a significant decrease in the average selling price of coal from $75.80/MT in 2023 to $61.30/MT in 2024, partially offset by a 19.10% increase in sales volumes to 56.20 million MT in 2024 from 47.20 million MT in 2023. <br><br> **Gross Margin:** The gross margin decreased from 46.50% in 2023 to 38.70% in 2024. This decline is attributed to the significantly lower average sales price of coal, despite a partial offset from lower cash costs. In 2023, the gross margin was 46.50%, a substantial drop from 67.20% in 2022, mainly due to lower average coal prices. <br><br> **Revenue by Product/Service:** Coal sales revenue decreased by 4.10% from $3,572,081,723.00 in 2023 to $3,425,060,528.00 in 2024. Non-coal sales revenue, however, increased significantly by 127.60% from $9,293,680.00 in 2023 to $21,154,426.00 in 2024, primarily due to an increase in mining services. In 2023, coal sales revenue decreased by 23.90% from $4,692,765,884.00 in 2022, while non-coal sales revenue decreased by 14.40% from $10,856,154.00 in 2022. <br><br> **Revenue by Geographic Region:** In 2024, Southeast Asia (excluding Indonesia) remained the largest market, though revenue decreased by 8.15% to $1,631,697,927.00 from $1,776,332,696.00 in 2023. East Asia saw a slight increase of 1.03% to $862,203,486.00 from $853,420,596.00. Domestic revenue increased by 6.25% to $527,715,192.00 from $496,679,171.00. South Asia experienced a 6.67% decrease to $424,598,349.00 from $454,942,940.00. Europe, which contributed $6,635,235.00 in 2022, had no revenue in 2023 and 2024. The shift in revenue distribution reflects the company's focus on Asian markets and domestic consumption. |
| Operating Efficiency | **Operating Expenses:** Operating expenses, comprising selling expenses and general and administrative expenses, increased from a net negative $57,049,163.00 in 2023 to $120,052,540.00 in 2024. This change was largely influenced by selling expenses, which shifted from a net credit of $28,442,512.00 in 2023 (due to a DMO compensation accrual reversal) to a debit of $38,792,502.00 in 2024. General and administrative expenses decreased slightly by 4.95% from $85,491,675.00 in 2023 to $81,260,038.00 in 2024. <br><br> **Operating Income:** Operating profit decreased by 25.39% from $1,639,598,949.00 in 2023 to $1,223,360,771.00 in 2024. This significant decline is primarily due to the lower gross profit and the increase in selling expenses. <br><br> **Operating Margins:** The operating profit margin decreased from 45.80% in 2023 to 35.50% in 2024, reflecting reduced profitability per unit of revenue. This trend indicates a challenge in maintaining operational efficiency amidst declining average selling prices and increased selling expenses. |
| External & One-Off Impact | **Effective Tax Rate:** The effective tax rate increased from 9.87% in 2023 to 7.61% in 2024. This is calculated by dividing the income tax expense by the profit before tax. In 2023, the effective tax rate was 21.64% ($353,387,654.00 / $1,632,968,496.00). In 2024, it was 21.75% ($262,147,463.00 / $1,205,522,529.00). The change in effective tax rate is influenced by various factors, including temporary and permanent differences, tax penalties, non-deductible expenses, and income subject to final tax. <br><br> **Non-Recurring Items:** In 2023, the company benefited from a significant non-recurring item: the reversal of the 2022 DMO compensation accrual, which resulted in a credit of $78,588,247.00 to selling expenses. This reversal substantially reduced selling expenses for the year. In 2024, there were no such large non-recurring reversals, leading to a normalized selling expense figure. The "Other (expenses)/income, net" category also shows fluctuations. In 2023, it was a net income of $7,036,615.00, while in 2024, it became a net expense of $17,177,673.00, primarily due to a net loss on foreign exchange of $20,061,658.00. These non-recurring and fluctuating items significantly impact the reported profitability for each year. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | The company faces market risks due to competition, global coal price fluctuations, and geopolitical tensions affecting demand and supply. The Global Coal Newcastle Index (Newcastle) and ICI4 coal prices were volatile, with Newcastle ranging from US$120 to US$150/MT and ICI4 declining from US$57.8/MT to US$50/MT in 2024. China's increased imports (11.6% to 365 million MT) and India's stable imports (0.3% increase) influenced demand. Vietnam's imports rose by 20.4% to 59 million MT. The market outlook for 2025 suggests a slight oversupply, with potential for dramatic price impacts from supply/demand shocks, particularly from China's import variations and weather events (El Nino/La Nina). Geopolitical tensions (Ukraine/Russia, Israel/Gaza) could disrupt oil and gas markets, indirectly affecting coal prices. | The company faces market risks due to significant fluctuations in global coal prices, which dropped rapidly in Q1 2023. The Newcastle Index averaged US$171/MT and ICI4 averaged US$63/MT, significantly lower than 2022. This was driven by the normalization of energy prices post-Ukraine war and increased supply from Indonesia and Australia. China's imports surged by 54.6% to 321 million MT, and India's imports increased by 5.3%. The market outlook for 2024 anticipates continued stability with support from growing demand in China and other Asian nations, as well as domestic Indonesian consumption. However, geopolitical tensions and weather events (El Nino) could still impact supply and demand dynamics. |
| Operational Risks | Operational risks include challenges in achieving production targets, managing logistics, and adapting to changing coal quality. In 2024, the company achieved record production of 56.9 million MT (14.4% higher than 2023) and record sales of 56.2 million MT (19.1% higher than 2023). Coal handling through BCT and KFTs reached 47.0 million MT (33.6% increase). The Tabang project's expansion, including road widening, overland conveyors, and new jetty construction, aims to increase production to over 80 MTPA. However, low water levels in Q4 2024 led to slightly higher inventory at Tabang. The company is mitigating this with alternative barge loading facilities on the Mahakam River. Inflation continues to be a concern, potentially increasing operating costs, though the company's low-cost base offers some protection. | Operational risks include challenges in achieving production targets, managing logistics, and adapting to changing market conditions. In 2023, the company achieved record production of 49.7 million MT (27.8% higher than 2022) and record sales of 47.2 million MT (18.3% higher than 2022). Coal handling through BCT and KFTs reached 35.2 million MT (5.5% increase). The Tabang project's expansion, including a 101 km hauling road and new barge loading facilities at Muara Pahu, aims to increase production to over 80 MTPA. However, low water levels in the Kedang Kepala River in Q3 and Q4 2023 led to inventory build-up. Inflationary pressures are also increasing operating costs, though the company's low-cost position helps mitigate this. |
| Financial Risks | Financial risks include fluctuations in revenue and profitability due to market prices, increased operating costs, and tax liabilities. In 2024, revenue decreased by 3.8% to US$3.45 billion, and gross profit decreased by 19.9% to US$1.33 billion, primarily due to a lower average selling price (US$61.3/MT vs. US$75.8/MT in 2023). Profit for the year decreased by 26.3% to US$943.4 million. Cost of revenue increased by 10.2% to US$2.11 billion, driven by higher overburden removal and coal mining costs. Selling expenses increased significantly by 236.4% to US$38.8 million. The company maintains a sound financial position with US$912.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and US$340 million drawn from working capital facilities. | Financial risks include fluctuations in revenue and profitability due due to market prices, increased operating costs, and tax liabilities. In 2023, revenue decreased by 23.9% to US$3.58 billion, and gross profit decreased by 47.3% to US$1.66 billion, primarily due to a significantly lower average selling price (US$75.8/MT vs. US$117.9/MT in 2022). Profit for the year decreased by 44.4% to US$1.28 billion. Cost of revenue increased by 24.2% to US$1.92 billion, driven by higher overburden removal, coal mining, and barging costs. Selling expenses decreased by 120.3% to US$(28.4) million due to the reversal of DMO compensation accrual. The company maintained a sound financial position with US$939 million in cash and cash equivalents, including US$204 million in restricted cash due to DHE policy. |
| Compliance Risks | Compliance risks involve adhering to evolving government policies and regulations in Indonesia, particularly in the mining sector. New regulations in 2025 include 100% export proceeds locked in bank accounts for 12 months, revocation of biodiesel FAME subsidy (increasing diesel costs by 25-30%), mandatory HBA-based coal sales, and the proposed Coal Public Service Agency (BLU) for DMO compliance. These changes are expected to increase costs for coal producers. The company also faces ongoing tax audits for 2018-2024 and new regulations like GR No. 8/2025 on export proceeds and MoFR No. 136/2024 on global minimum tax. Legal cases, such as the BAS and FSP land dispute, could also impact operations and reputation, though the company successfully acquired EAS and withdrew the cassation request, concluding the case. | Compliance risks involve adhering to evolving government policies and regulations in Indonesia, particularly in the mining sector. Key policies in 2023 included financial penalties for DMO non-compliance, increased royalty rates for IUP/IUPK, and the Foreign Exchange Proceeds from Exported Natural Resources Goods (DHE SDA) policy, requiring 30% of export proceeds to be held in designated bank accounts for three months. These policies are expected to increase costs for coal producers. The company also faces ongoing tax audits for 2020-2023 and legal disputes, such as the BAS and FSP land case, which could impact operations and reputation. The Job Creation Law and related regulations also introduce changes in labor and environmental compliance. |

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The report indicates that inflation continues to be a significant topic, with certain indices increasing substantially in 2024 and expected to continue into 2025. While the Company will not be immune, its low-cost base in the energy-adjusted seaborne thermal coal market positions it to be less impacted than other producers. Global economic growth is predicted to remain stable at 3.2% in 2024 and 2025, with world trade growing by 3.1% in 2024 and 3.4% in 2025. Key risks include financial market volatility, slower global disinflation, extended contraction in China's property sector, and increased protectionist policies. | The report highlights that inflation continues to be a hot topic, with certain indices increasing significantly in 2023 and expected to continue into 2024. The Company acknowledges that while it will not be immune to inflation, its position in the lowest quartile of costs in the energy-adjusted seaborne thermal coal market will mitigate the impact compared to other producers. The global coal market outlook for 2024 is expected to remain relatively balanced between supply and demand. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces | The report notes that the market for thermal coal is set for a challenging period in 2025, characterized by declining prices and shifting demand patterns as some countries transition to more sustainable energy sources. The Company believes that Newcastle prices around US$100 and ICI4 in the low-US$50s represent a floor, below which many producers would operate at a loss, leading to production cuts. The Company is well-positioned due to its large coal reserve base, low position on the seaborne thermal coal cost curve, superior infrastructure, and low CO2 equivalent emissions, aiming to be a "last man standing" supplier. | The report indicates that the global coal market experienced turbulence over the past three years, with demand dropping during the Covid pandemic and then rebounding. While global coal demand reached a record high in 2022, it is expected to decline in almost all advanced economies in 2023. The Company acknowledges that thermal coal mining is a sunset industry, with export demand projected to reduce significantly by 2050. However, the Company believes it is well-positioned due to its large coal reserve base, low cost on the seaborne thermal coal curve, superior infrastructure, and low CO2 equivalent emissions, aiming to be a "last man standing" supplier. |
