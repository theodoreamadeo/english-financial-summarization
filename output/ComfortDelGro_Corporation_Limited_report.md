# Section 3: Business Analysis

## 3.1 Profitability Analysis

| Perspective | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | In 2024, ComfortDelGro's revenue increased by 15.37% to S$4,476.50 million from S$3,880.30 million in 2023. This growth was primarily driven by the Taxi & Private Hire segment, which saw a significant increase of 30.28% from S$574.70 million in 2023 to S$748.70 million in 2024. The Public Transport segment also grew by 5.01% from S$2,959.30 million to S$3,107.50 million. Other Private Transport experienced a substantial increase of 182.48% from S$143.80 million to S$406.20 million, largely due to acquisitions. Inspection and Testing Services revenue increased by 6.85% to S$117.00 million, and Other Segments grew by 4.41% to S$97.10 million. <br><br>Geographically, the United Kingdom/EU region showed the highest growth, with revenue increasing by 47.83% from S$870.10 million in 2023 to S$1,286.30 million in 2024. Australia's revenue increased by 18.24% from S$686.20 million to S$811.30 million. Singapore's revenue saw a modest increase of 2.35% from S$2,227.10 million to S$2,279.40 million. China's revenue remained relatively stable, increasing by 2.50% from S$96.00 million to S$98.40 million. Malaysia's revenue increased by 22.22% from S$0.90 million to S$1.10 million. <br><br>The gross margin, calculated as (Revenue - Operating Costs) / Revenue, was 7.21% in 2024, a slight decrease from 7.01% in 2023. While revenue grew, operating costs increased at a faster rate of 15.11% from S$3,608.20 million in 2023 to S$4,153.60 million in 2024. This indicates that while the company achieved significant revenue growth, direct costs also rose proportionally, impacting the gross margin. |
| Operating Efficiency | The company's operating efficiency, as measured by the operating margin (Operating Profit / Revenue), slightly decreased from 7.01% in 2023 to 7.21% in 2024. Operating profit increased by 18.67% from S$272.10 million in 2023 to S$322.90 million in 2024. However, operating expenses also increased significantly by 15.11% from S$3,608.20 million to S$4,153.60 million. <br><br>Key operating cost components showed varying trends: Staff costs increased by 9.89% to S$2,024.10 million, Contract services surged by 100.19% to S$417.40 million, and Road tax and licence fees increased by 37.38% to S$74.60 million. Fuel and electricity costs decreased by 6.39% to S$397.20 million, indicating some efficiency gains or favorable market conditions in this area. Depreciation and amortisation costs remained relatively stable, increasing by 1.17% to S$368.40 million. The substantial increase in contract services and other operating costs (which increased by 160.51% to S$112.80 million) suggests that while revenue growth was strong, the company incurred higher costs to support this expansion, particularly through external services and acquisitions. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate for ComfortDelGro increased from 19.64% in 2023 to 19.46% in 2024. This slight decrease indicates a relatively stable tax environment or minor changes in tax liabilities relative to profit before taxation. <br><br>In terms of non-recurring items, the net gain on disposal of vehicles, premises, and equipment decreased from S$6.40 million in 2023 to S$5.10 million in 2024, representing a 20.29% reduction. This suggests a lower contribution from asset disposals to profitability in 2024 compared to the previous year. <br><br>The company's profit before taxation increased by 13.39% from S$280.00 million in 2023 to S$317.50 million in 2024. The taxation expense increased by 12.36% from S$55.00 million to S$61.80 million. The overall impact of external and one-off items on profitability appears to be consistent with the company's operational performance, with no major unusual events significantly distorting the financial results in either year. |

## 3.2 Financial Performance Summary

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Comprehensive financial health | The Group's total assets increased by 22.09% to S$5,725.80 million in 2024 from S$4,689.70 million in 2023, driven by significant acquisitions and investments in non-current assets. Total liabilities also increased by 61.13% to S$2,700.20 million from S$1,675.80 million, primarily due to a substantial rise in borrowings (208.74% increase to S$1,081.60 million) and trade and other payables (23.99% increase to S$1,001.10 million). Despite the increase in liabilities, total equity saw a modest increase of 0.39% to S$3,025.60 million, indicating that asset growth was largely debt-financed. The current ratio (Current Assets / Current Liabilities) decreased significantly from 147.84% in 2023 to 105.46% in 2024, suggesting a tightening of short-term liquidity. The debt-to-equity ratio (Total Liabilities / Total Equity) increased from 55.59% in 2023 to 89.25% in 2024, reflecting a higher reliance on debt financing. Cash and cash equivalents increased by 4.19% to S$892.40 million, while net cash from operating activities increased by 21.91% to S$547.50 million, demonstrating healthy operational cash generation. | The Group's total assets remained relatively stable, decreasing slightly by 0.26% to S$4,689.70 million in 2023 from S$4,701.90 million in 2022.

Return on shareholders' equity (Profit Attributable to Shareholders / Equity Attributable to Shareholders) improved to 8.10% from 6.90%. The dividend payout ratio was 80.00% in 2024, consistent with the company's updated dividend policy. The increase in profitability was driven by strong revenue growth across all segments, particularly Taxi & Private Hire and Other Private Transport, supported by strategic acquisitions. The effective tax rate remained stable at 19.46%. | Profit attributable to shareholders increased by 4.27% to S$180.50 million in 2023 from S$173.10 million in 2022. Earnings per share (EPS) grew by 4.26% to 8.33 cents. The net profit margin was 5.80% in 2023, a slight increase from 5.78% in 2022. Return on shareholders' equity was 6.90%, an improvement from 6.70% in 2022. The dividend payout ratio was 80.00% in 2023, reflecting the company's commitment to its updated dividend policy. The increase in profitability was attributed to sustained recovery across all segments, higher rail ridership, fare increases, and bus contract renewals. The effective tax rate was 19.64%. |
| Operational efficiency | Operating profit increased by 18.67% to S$322.90 million in 2024 from S$272.10 million in 2023. The operating margin (Operating Profit / Revenue) was 7.21% in 2024, a slight increase from 7.01% in 2023. This indicates improved operational efficiency relative to revenue. Staff costs increased by 9.89% to S$2,024.10 million, while contract services significantly increased by 100.19% to S$417.40 million, reflecting increased outsourcing or external support for expanded operations. Fuel and electricity costs decreased by 6.39% to S$397.20 million, suggesting better fuel management or lower energy prices. Depreciation and amortisation remained relatively stable, increasing by 1.17% to S$368.40 million. The increase in operating profit despite rising costs suggests effective cost control in some areas and successful integration of new business units. | Operating profit remained relatively stable, increasing by 0.74% to S$272.10 million in 2023 from S$270.00 million in 2022. The operating margin was 7.01% in 2023, a slight decrease from 7.14% in 2022. Staff costs increased by 1.38% to S$1,841.80 million. Fuel and electricity costs increased by 1.70% to S$424.30 million. Depreciation and amortisation increased by 1.96% to S$364.20 million. Contract services increased significantly by 26.75% to S$208.50 million, indicating higher reliance on external services. The relatively flat operating profit despite revenue growth suggests that cost increases largely offset revenue gains, leading to a stable but not significantly improved operating efficiency. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | The company's financial risk profile increased in 2024 due to higher leverage. The debt-to-equity ratio rose to 89.25% from 55.59%, indicating a greater reliance on debt. The current ratio decreased to 105.46% from 147.84%, signaling reduced short-term liquidity. Interest expense increased by 69.87% to S$38.90 million, reflecting higher borrowing costs and increased debt. The company's capital commitments for purchases of equipment, buses, taxis, motor vehicles, computer systems, and development of bus depots and properties significantly increased by 197.94% to S$491.30 million, indicating substantial future investment plans that will require further financing. The increase in non-current liabilities by 53.97% to S$899.50 million also highlights a growing long-term financial obligation. | The company maintained a moderate financial risk profile in 2023. The debt-to-equity ratio was 55.59%, indicating manageable leverage. The current ratio of 147.84% suggested adequate short-term liquidity. Interest expense increased by 72.18% to S$22.90 million, reflecting rising interest rates. Capital commitments increased by 59.02% to S$164.90 million, indicating planned investments. The company remained in a net cash position of S$497.50 million with S$874.90 million of unutilised banking facilities, providing a buffer against financial shocks. |
| Future financial performance projection | The company projects continued growth, particularly in its Public Transport and Taxi & Private Hire segments, driven by acquisitions and contract wins. The expansion into new markets (e.g., Stockholm Metro) and adjacent businesses (e.g., CMAC Group) is expected to contribute to future revenue. Investments in future capabilities, such as autonomous vehicles and EV charging infrastructure, position the company for long-term growth in evolving mobility markets. However, increased capital commitments and higher debt levels suggest that future profitability will depend on successful integration of acquisitions and efficient management of new projects to generate sufficient returns to cover increased financing costs. The company's dividend policy of paying out at least 70% of PATMI is expected to continue, providing consistent shareholder returns. | The company projected sustained recovery and growth across all segments, with a focus on expanding core businesses and new markets. Strategic acquisitions in the UK (Vedamain) and Australia (A2B Australia) were expected to diversify point-to-point mobility offerings. Investments in EV charging infrastructure and mobility technology start-ups (Ottopia, Shift4Good) aimed to future-proof the company. The updated dividend policy of paying out at least 70% of PATMI signaled confidence in future earnings. The company's strong net cash position and unutilised banking facilities provided financial flexibility for future growth initiatives. |
