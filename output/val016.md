# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | In 2024, the company's revenue decreased by 34.65% to Rp 2,553,285,289,717.00 from Rp 3,906,826,399,192.00 in 2023. This decline was primarily due to a significant reduction in revenue from the Mixed-use & High-rise segment, which fell by 81.67% from Rp 2,027,851,000,000.00 in 2023 to Rp 371,760,000,000.00 in 2024. This was attributed to the completion of the Fifty Seven Promenade project in late 2022, with peak unit handovers occurring in 2023, leading to higher recognized revenue in that year. Conversely, the Industrial Estate segment showed remarkable growth, with revenue increasing by 159.28% to Rp 638,349,000,000.00 in 2024 from Rp 246,205,000,000.00 in 2023, driven by land sales in Batang Industrial Park and warehouse units in Aeropolis. The Landed Residential segment experienced a 23.46% decrease in revenue, from Rp 861,503,000,000.00 in 2023 to Rp 659,423,000,000.00 in 2024. Recurring Income, however, grew by 14.58% to Rp 883,754,000,000.00 in 2024 from Rp 771,267,000,000.00 in 2023, primarily from facilities management, sports clubs, and office leases. The gross margin significantly declined to 30.76% in 2024 from 40.59% in 2023, reflecting the substantial drop in high-margin Mixed-use & High-rise revenue. |
| Operating Efficiency | The company's operating efficiency deteriorated in 2024, with the operating profit margin decreasing to 17.79% from 32.52% in 2023. Operating profit saw a substantial decline of 64.25%, falling to Rp 454,231,193,690.00 in 2024 from Rp 1,270,469,130,996.00 in 2023. This was primarily due to the sharp decrease in revenue, particularly from the Mixed-use & High-rise segment. Operating expenses, however, increased by a modest 5.01% to Rp 331,120,810,072.00 in 2024 from Rp 315,326,684,997.00 in 2023. This increase was driven by a 21.06% rise in selling expenses, mainly due to a 98.08% increase in sales commissions, despite a 12.10% decrease in promotion and advertising costs. General and administrative expenses saw a slight increase of 2.08%, primarily due to a 2.30% rise in salaries and wages. The disproportionate decline in revenue compared to the increase in operating expenses led to the significant drop in operating profitability. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate for the company increased significantly to 15.41% in 2024 from 11.25% in 2023. This change indicates a higher tax burden on the company's pre-tax profit. In 2024, the company recognized a substantial "Gain on extinguishment of financial liabilities" of Rp 328,161,741,895.00, which was a non-recurring item resulting from the restructuring of syndicated bank loans. This gain positively impacted the pre-tax profit. In contrast, 2023 included a "Dampak Pendiskontoan Liabilitas Keuangan" (Impact of Discounting Financial Liabilities) of Rp -187,378,880,639.00, which was a non-recurring expense. The "Equity in net loss of associates and joint ventures" also shifted from a gain of Rp 396,154,857,501.00 in 2023 to a gain of Rp 73,340,417,189.00 in 2024, representing a significant decrease in contribution from these entities. The "Allowance for decline in value of advances" was a non-recurring expense of Rp -286,048,586,561.00 in 2023, which was not present in 2024. These non-recurring items and changes in contributions from associates and joint ventures had a notable impact on the company's profitability in both years. |

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## 4.1 Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---------- | :---------- | :---------- |
| Market Risks | **Competition:** The property market in 2024 remains challenging, with high-rise properties (apartments and offices) lagging behind residential and industrial segments. This stagnation is due to low demand and high existing supply, making it difficult for the company to launch new projects in these segments. <br> **Economic Conditions:** Global economic growth is moderate due to geopolitical tensions and trade wars, impacting market uncertainty. Domestically, while Indonesia's economy grew by 5.02% in 2024, global factors still pose challenges. <br> **Consumer Behavior:** Consumer purchasing power and investment confidence are affected by political uncertainty and global economic slowdowns. Demand for affordable landed housing is increasing, driven by government incentives (PPN DTP), while high-rise property demand remains stagnant. <br> **Regulatory Changes:** Government policies like the PPN DTP incentive are crucial for driving property sales, particularly in the residential sector. However, the effectiveness of these incentives can vary and may not fully recover all segments of the property market. | **Competition:** The property market in 2023 was challenging, with low buying interest and investment, especially in the mixed-use and high-rise segments. The company noted a shift in consumer demand towards residential and industrial areas, while apartment and strata-title office sales remained stagnant. <br> **Economic Conditions:** Global economic growth slowed to 2.6% in 2023 due to geopolitical tensions and high inflation. Domestically, Indonesia's economy grew by 5.05%, but political uncertainties surrounding the 2024 elections affected investor confidence. <br> **Consumer Behavior:** Low consumer buying interest and investment, particularly in high-rise properties, persisted. The market for middle-to-upper-class landed housing (above Rp1 billion) experienced delays due to political and economic uncertainties, while the lower-middle-class segment (below Rp700 million) remained stable. <br> **Regulatory Changes:** Government incentives like the PPN DTP were effective in boosting property sales, especially in the second half of 2023. However, the impact was not uniform across all segments, with high-rise properties still struggling. |
| Operational Risks | **Project Development:** The company faces challenges in launching new high-rise projects due to stagnant demand and high existing inventory. The focus has shifted to residential and industrial segments, which show faster growth. <br> **Human Resources:** The total number of employees decreased from 1,288 in 2023 to 1,224 in 2024, indicating potential challenges in talent retention or workforce optimization. <br> **Supply Chain:** The company's engineering review process aims to rationalize design elements and scrutinize specifications to avoid over-specification, which can lead to cost overruns in tenders. <br> **IT Infrastructure:** Continuous development and upgrades to IT systems are necessary to support productivity, internal controls, and data security. The launch of new solutions like Keep Storage requires robust IT implementation. | **Project Development:** The company faced challenges in launching new high-rise projects due to stagnant demand and high existing inventory. The focus shifted to residential and industrial segments, which showed more dynamic growth. <br> **Human Resources:** Employee turnover reached its highest level since the pandemic, indicating potential challenges in retaining talent. The total number of employees decreased from 1,336 in 2022 to 1,288 in 2023. <br> **Supply Chain:** Over-specification in tenders was a key finding, requiring early collaborative planning with consultants and engineers to rationalize designs and control costs. <br> **IT Infrastructure:** The company needed to strengthen its IT team to leverage technology for data transparency and internal controls, as well as to develop new solutions like the Human Capital Information System (HCIS). |
| Financial Risks | **Revenue Volatility:** Total revenue decreased by 34.65% in 2024, primarily due to reduced recognition from mixed-use & high-rise development activities, particularly the Fifty Seven Promenade project, where peak unit handovers occurred in 2023. <br> **Profitability Pressure:** Gross profit and operating profit significantly declined in 2024, indicating pressure on profitability despite a relatively stable net profit attributable to the parent entity. <br> **Debt Management:** While total liabilities decreased by 13.74% due to bank loan and sukuk repayments, the company continues to manage its debt structure carefully. The net debt to equity ratio improved from 58.49% in 2023 to 50.35% in 2024. <br> **Cash Flow:** Cash and cash equivalents decreased by 17.37% in 2024, mainly due to debt repayments. Cash flows from operating activities increased, but cash used in investing activities also rose significantly. | **Revenue Volatility:** Total revenue increased by 24.08% in 2023, driven by the residential and mixed-use & high-rise segments. However, marketing sales decreased by 2% compared to 2022, primarily due to low demand for apartment products. <br> **Profitability Pressure:** The company returned to profitability in 2023 with a net profit of Rp174.4 billion, a significant improvement from a net loss in 2022. However, a large portion of the profit was attributable to non-controlling interests in joint projects. <br> **Debt Management:** Total liabilities decreased by 20.44% in 2023, mainly due to a reduction in bank loans and contract liabilities. The net debt to equity ratio increased by 2.58% compared to 2022, indicating a slight increase in leverage. <br> **Cash Flow:** Cash and cash equivalents decreased by 17.92% in 2023, primarily due to project completion and construction activities. Cash used in operating activities decreased, while cash from investing activities increased due to higher dividends from associate companies. |
| Compliance Risks | **Legal Disputes:** The company is involved in several legal cases, including lawsuits against the Governor of DKI Jakarta and Badan Pertanahan Nasional (BPN) regarding land disputes, and a cassation lawsuit from third parties. These cases, while not deemed material enough to affect the company's continuity, still pose potential risks. <br> **Regulatory Compliance:** The company emphasizes adherence to OJK regulations and other applicable laws. Changes in accounting policies and tax regulations require continuous monitoring and adaptation to ensure compliance. <br> **Anti-Corruption and Gratification:** The company maintains strict anti-corruption and gratification policies, with all employees and external parties signing an Integrity Pact. Violations are met with severe penalties, including termination. | **Legal Disputes:** The company was involved in several legal cases, including lawsuits against the Governor of DKI Jakarta and Badan Pertanahan Nasional (BPN) regarding land disputes, and a cassation lawsuit from third parties.
