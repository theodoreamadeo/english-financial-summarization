# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Perspective | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | The company's total revenue increased from $61,769,967.00 in 2023 to $66,236,058.00 in 2024, representing a growth rate of 7.23%. This growth was primarily driven by technology sales (hardware and SaaS), which increased from $23,970,953.00 in 2023 to $32,921,310.00 in 2024, a 37.34% increase. As a result, the revenue share of technology sales increased from 38.81% of total revenue in 2023 to 49.70% in 2024. Conversely, services revenue decreased from $37,799,014.00 in 2023 to $33,314,748.00 in 2024, a decline of 11.86%. The overall gross profit margin improved from 59.68% in 2023 to 64.12% in 2024. This improvement is attributed to the increased proportion of higher-margin technology sales. Geographically, North America remained the largest revenue contributor, increasing its revenue from $35,383,998.00 in 2023 to $43,317,480.00 in 2024, a 22.43% growth. APAC revenue decreased from $20,988,485.00 in 2023 to $18,159,913.00 in 2024, a 13.50% decline. EMEA revenue also decreased from $5,397,484.00 in 2023 to $4,758,665.00 in 2024, a 11.83% decline. |
| Operating Efficiency | The company's operating efficiency showed improvement, with the loss before income tax decreasing from $(2,306,064.00) in 2023 to $(296,283.00) in 2024. This represents a significant reduction in operating losses. The operating margin (Loss before income tax / Revenue) improved from -3.73% in 2023 to -0.45% in 2024. Total operating expenses (excluding cost of inventories consumed, depreciation, amortisation, finance costs, and income tax expense) increased from $56,483,820.00 in 2023 to $58,064,196.00 in 2024, a 2.80% increase. However, revenue grew at a faster rate (7.23%), indicating better cost management relative to revenue growth. Employee benefits expense decreased from $39,483,865.00 in 2023 to $42,570,307.00 in 2024, a 7.82% increase. Outsourcing and contractor expenses decreased from $6,536,330.00 in 2023 to $4,271,739.00 in 2024, a 34.65% decrease, reflecting the shift away from human-based services. Information technology related expenses increased from $4,932,213.00 in 2023 to $5,337,395.00 in 2024, an 8.21% increase, aligning with the focus on technology. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate (Income tax expense / Loss before income tax expense) changed significantly from -74.20% in 2023 to -352.61% in 2024. The negative effective tax rate in both years indicates that the company recognized a tax expense despite reporting a loss before income tax. In 2023, the income tax expense was $1,711,000.00 on a loss before income tax of $(2,306,064.00). In 2024, the income tax expense was $1,044,713.00 on a loss before income tax of $(296,283.00). The 2023 report mentions "Other revenue" of $456,469.00, which "consists of a one off reversal of an over accrual of USA sales tax." This was a non-recurring item that positively impacted profitability in 2023. There was no equivalent "Other revenue" in 2024. The 2024 report notes a "reversal of an over accrual of USA sales tax" in the comments section for "Other revenue**" in the EBITDA reconciliation table, but the value is $0.00 for 2024, indicating no such one-off benefit in that year. |

The cash balance decreased by 35.65% to $10,927,978.00, which warrants monitoring, but the company states it has "no debt" and a "robust balance sheet." The reduction in "Other payables from acquisitions" from $7,776,772.00 to $0.00 is a positive sign, as this was a significant liability in 2023. The company's ability to generate positive operating cash flow ($3,566,414.00) provides a buffer against liquidity concerns. | The company's financial risk profile was moderate. The current ratio was 1.50, indicating adequate liquidity. A significant current liability was "Other payables from acquisitions" amounting to $7,776,772.00, which included an earn-out payment for the EEG acquisition and a deferred liability for the ACS acquisition. This represented a substantial short-term obligation. The company had a cash balance of $17,000,000.00, which was sufficient to cover these payments. The company stated it had "minimal debt." |
| Future financial performance projection | The company projects continued growth, particularly in technology revenue, targeting over 80% of total revenue by December 2025. This shift is expected to further improve gross profit margins and deliver valuation uplift. Key growth strategies include global expansion (EMEA, APAC, Latin America), expanding beyond broadcast into government, enterprise, and education sectors, and driving adoption of new AI-powered LEXI products (LEXI DR, LEXI Recorded, LEXI Audio Description, LEXI Live Voice Dubbing, LEXI Library).
