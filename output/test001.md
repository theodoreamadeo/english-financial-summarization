# Section 3: Business Analysis

## 3.1 Profitability Analysis

| Perspective | Answer |
| :---------- | :----- |
| Revenue Growth | The company's gross revenue decreased by 4.90% from $369,723,000 in 2023 to $351,733,000 in 2024. This decline was primarily attributed to the divestment of Changi City Point in October 2023 and lower contributions from Tampines 1 due to Asset Enhancement Initiative (AEI) works. Excluding these two factors, gross revenue would have increased by 3.50% year-on-year. |
| Gross Margin | The gross margin, calculated as (Gross Revenue - Property Expenses) / Gross Revenue, decreased from 71.88% in 2023 to 72.06% in 2024. This slight increase in gross margin despite a revenue decline indicates a relatively better control over property-related expenses in 2024. Property expenses decreased by 5.56% from $104,137,000 in 2023 to $98,347,000 in 2024, which helped to cushion the impact of lower revenue on profitability. |
| Revenue by Product/Service | The company's revenue is primarily derived from rental income from its retail malls and an office building. The reports do not provide a detailed breakdown of revenue by specific product or service categories beyond gross rental income, gross turnover rental income, carpark income, and other income. Gross rental income decreased from $331,255,000 in 2023 to $316,427,000 in 2024, a 4.47% decline. Gross turnover rental income also decreased from $18,349,000 in 2023 to $15,725,000 in 2024, a 14.20% decline. Carpark income saw a minor decrease of 1.58% from $7,281,000 in 2023 to $7,166,000 in 2024. Other income decreased by 3.30% from $12,838,000 in 2023 to $12,415,000 in 2024. |
| Revenue by Geographic Region | The company's operations are primarily in Singapore. The reports do not provide a detailed breakdown of revenue by different geographic regions within Singapore. |
| Net Property Income | Net Property Income (NPI) decreased by 4.60% from $265,586,000 in 2023 to $253,386,000 in 2024. This decline is consistent with the decrease in gross revenue, primarily due to the divestment of Changi City Point and AEI works at Tampines 1. Excluding these factors, NPI would have increased by 3.40% year-on-year. |

## 3.1.2 Operating Efficiency

| Perspective | Answer |
| :---------- | :----- |
| Operating Expenses | Total operating expenses (excluding property expenses) increased by 6.70% from $116,500,000 in 2023 to $124,300,000 in 2024. This increase was mainly driven by higher finance costs and asset management fees. Finance costs increased by 3.86% from $81,042,000 in 2023 to $84,168,000 in 2024, primarily due to higher interest rates and additional loan drawdowns. Asset management fees increased by 4.06% from $35,468,000 in 2023 to $36,901,000 in 2024, reflecting higher net property income and total assets. |
| Operating Income | Operating income (Net Property Income - Finance Costs - Asset Management Fees - Other Operating Expenses) decreased by 13.91% from $149,069,000 in 2023 to $129,038,000 in 2024. This decline is a direct consequence of lower NPI and increased non-property operating expenses. |
| Operating Margin | The operating margin (Operating Income / Gross Revenue) decreased from 40.32% in 2023 to 36.69% in 2024. This indicates a reduction in the company's efficiency in converting revenue into operating profit, largely due to the combined effect of lower revenue and higher finance and asset management costs. |
| Cost Management Trends | While property expenses saw a slight decrease, overall cost management faced challenges due to rising interest rates and increased asset management fees. The company's strategy to mitigate these impacts includes cost optimization initiatives and hedging strategies for energy contracts. The divestment of non-core assets and AEI works are also part of a broader strategy to enhance portfolio resilience and improve overall performance, which should positively impact cost efficiency in the long run. |
| Operational Performance Trends | Operational performance, as reflected by NPI, saw a slight decline due to specific divestments and AEI. However, excluding these factors, NPI would have shown growth. The increase in finance costs and asset management fees impacted the overall operating income and margin. The company continues to focus on active lease management and asset enhancement initiatives to drive rental growth and maintain healthy occupancy rates, which are crucial for long-term operational performance. |

## 3.1.3 External & One-Off Impact

| Perspective | Answer |
| :---------- | :----- |
| Effective Tax Rate | The effective tax rate for the Group changed significantly from -0.12% in 2023 to -0.55% in 2024. In 2023, the tax expense was $250,000 on a total return before tax of $212,204,000, resulting in an effective tax rate of 0.12%. In 2024, the company reported a tax credit of $1,082,000 on a total return before tax of $196,464,000, leading to an effective tax rate of -0.55%. The tax credit in 2024 mainly arose from over-provision of prior year tax expenses of certain subsidiaries. The tax transparency ruling for REITs in Singapore means that the Trust itself is generally not assessed for tax on taxable income distributed to unitholders, which significantly impacts the reported effective tax rate. |
| Non-Recurring Items | In 2023, the company recognized $3,815,000 in other income, which included a one-off grant income related to property tax rebates and cash grants from IRAS. This contributed positively to the total return before tax in 2023. In 2024, there was no such one-off grant income. <br><br> In 2024, the company reported a gain on divestment of investment property and investment in joint venture of $11,272,000, primarily from the divestment of Changi City Point. This was partially offset by a loss on divestment of investment in H-REIT of $24,644,000, which included a realized foreign exchange loss of $700,000 and the realization of translation reserve of $23,600,000. These divestments are considered non-recurring items that significantly impacted the total return before tax in 2024. <br><br> In 2023, there was an impairment loss on investment in associate of $3,982,000. This was a one-off charge that reduced profitability in 2023. |

# Section 6: Future Outlook

## S6.1: Strategic Direction

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) to expand market share | FCT's growth strategies include acquisition growth, focusing on identifying and pursuing opportunities to acquire additional income-producing properties or properties that could be developed or redeveloped into income-producing properties. These acquisitions should meet FCT's investment objectives to enhance yields and returns for Unitholders while improving portfolio diversification. Opportunities include Sponsor's pipeline assets and third-party assets in Singapore. In FY24, FCT completed the acquisition of an additional 24.5% interest in NEX for $523.1 million, increasing its total effective interest to 50.0%. This acquisition reinforces FCT's focus and leadership position in the Singapore prime suburban retail market, aiming to diversify its income base, enhance portfolio resilience, and improve overall retail portfolio performance. | FCT's growth strategies include acquisition growth, which involves identifying and pursuing opportunities to acquire additional income-producing properties or properties that could be developed or redeveloped into income-producing properties. The acquisitions should meet FCT's investment objectives to enhance yields and returns for Unitholders while improving portfolio diversification. Acquisition opportunities include Sponsor's pipeline assets and third-party assets in Singapore. In FY23, FCT completed the joint acquisition of a 50.00% interest in NEX (FCT's effective interest 25.50%) and an additional 10.00% interest in Waterway Point (bringing FCT's total interest to 50.00%). These acquisitions were strategic moves to expand FCT’s presence in Singapore’s suburban retail market and strengthen its portfolio quality. |
| Acquire new technologies | FCT is leveraging innovation and technology to improve efficiency in its operations and reduce costs. Initiatives include a food waste valorisation system, data analytics for lifts ("SMART Lifts"), and a water valve efficiency initiative. The "SMART Lifts" initiative uses data analytics to determine optimal quarterly maintenance regimes, while the M&E platform integrates building facilities management systems for real-time data analytics and abnormality identification, targeting a reduction of almost one million kWh of annual energy wastage. The food waste valorisation system transforms food waste into commercial-grade fish feed, aiming to reduce 2,200 tonnes of food waste and 660 tonnes of carbon emissions annually. | FCT is leveraging innovation and technology to improve efficiency in its operations and reduce costs. Initiatives include food waste management, data analytics for lifts ("SMART Lifts"), and a water valve efficiency initiative. The projected savings from these initiatives, once fully implemented, are approximately $1 million per annum. The "SMART Lifts" initiative uses data analytics to determine the optimal quarterly maintenance regime for elevators based on usage and wear rate, aiming for cost savings and waste reduction. The water valve efficiency initiative regulates air and water pressure in pipes to improve flow efficiency and reduce water bills. |

## S6.2: Challenges and Uncertainties

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | The Manager expects interest rate movements and the increase in operating expenses to remain the key factors affecting FCT's performance. Barring unforeseen circumstances, the average cost of borrowings is expected to remain around the low-4.0% level for FY25. The Manager will continue to drive cost optimization initiatives and adopt appropriate hedging strategies for energy contracts to mitigate the impact on utilities expenses. The report also acknowledges macroeconomic uncertainties and the need to build greater resilience. | The Manager expects interest rate movements and rising operating expenses to remain key factors affecting FCT's performance. The average cost of borrowing is expected to be above 4%. For operating expenses, the Manager will continue cost optimization initiatives and remain vigilant on energy prices and contracted service fees, adopting appropriate hedging strategies. The macroeconomic environment is challenging, with inflation and surges in energy costs, and extreme climate change events posing threats to assets and supply chains. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces. | The report highlights the potential for increased competition in the North Region with the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) scheduled to commence in end-2026. This could lead to a potential loss of sales for Singapore retailers and mall operators as more Singaporeans might choose to spend in Johor Bahru due to the strength of the Singapore dollar. However, FCT believes its malls in the North (Causeway Point and Northpoint City) are well-positioned due to increased residential and commuter traffic, which will outweigh the downside risk. | The report notes that the retail market continues to be supported by a below historical-average retail pipeline in the near term, and retailers remain cautiously optimistic, prioritizing well-managed and well-located malls. Leasing demand for suburban retail malls remained robust in FY2023, particularly by food and beverage and services tenants. The report also mentions that physical stores will continue to play a critical role, with high-quality, well-managed, and well-located retail centers likely to experience a faster uptick in sales. |

## S6.3: Innovation and Development Plans

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |

| R&D investments, with a focus on advancing technology, improving products, and creating new solutions to cater to market trends | FCT is committed to leveraging technology to achieve ESG goals, as demonstrated by the continued enhancement of the "Eco-Perks" program on the Frasers Experience (FRx) mobile application. This program encourages eco-conscious behavior among shoppers through activities like food donation drives and upcycling events, aiming for waste and carbon emission reductions. FCT also launched an online ESG Databook to enhance transparency of its ESG data disclosures. Furthermore, FCT is implementing "Smart Valves" in its HVAC systems to optimize cooling efficiency and reduce energy consumption by approximately 550,000 kWh per year. | FCT is leveraging innovation and technology to improve efficiency in its operations and reduce costs.

| New product launches, emphasizing the company's commitment to continuously introducing differentiated products | FCT completed the Asset Enhancement Initiative (AEI) at Tampines 1 in August 2024, introducing 68 new-to-mall retail and F&B concepts, including Sinpopo, Tiong Bahru Bakery, Hawkers' Street, and Love, Bonito. This rejuvenation added over 9,000 sq ft of net lettable space and improved common areas, achieving a return on investment greater than the target of 8% on a capital expenditure of $38 million. Looking ahead, FCT plans a $51 million AEI at Hougang Mall, commencing in Q2 2025 and completing in Q3 2026, to create a refreshed retail experience with new brands, space reconfiguration, and value unlocking, with a projected ROI of approximately 7%. | FCT announced the commencement of a $38.2 million Asset Enhancement Initiative (AEI) at Tampines 1 in Q3 FY2023, aiming to create a refreshed retail experience with new retail brands and services, improve asset yield, and unlock value through space reconfiguration. The projected return on investment (ROI) of this AEI is approximately 8% from higher rent income and savings from sustainable features. The new AEI space attracted strong leasing interest with over 94% in pre-commitment. FCT also continues to enhance its Frasers Experience loyalty program to promote an omnichannel retail experience. |
