# Section 3: Business Analysis

## 3.1 Profitability Analysis

| Field | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | In 2024, Delfi's Net Sales decreased by 6.60% year-over-year to US$502.70 million from US$538.20 million in 2023. This decline was primarily attributed to weaker regional currencies against the US Dollar, particularly the Indonesian Rupiah, higher promotional investments to counter competition and drive long-term brand growth, and the termination of an agency brand in late 2023. On a constant currency basis, the decrease in Net Sales would have been 3.90%. The Gross Profit in 2024 was US$137.80 million, a 10.10% decrease from US$153.20 million in 2023. The Gross Profit Margin (GPM) also decreased to 27.40% in 2024 from 28.50% in 2023, a reduction of 1.10 percentage points. This reduction was due to lower Net Sales, the impact of a stronger US Dollar on imported raw material costs, and higher trade promotions in the second half of 2024. In 2023, Net Sales increased by 12.70% year-over-year to a record US$538.20 million, driven by sustained economic growth and buoyant consumer demand in key markets, particularly Indonesia and Regional Markets, which saw growth of 11.20% and 15.60% respectively. Gross Profit in 2023 increased by 5.30% to US$153.20 million, but the GPM decreased by 2.00 percentage points to 28.50% due to higher promotional spending and strategic investments in core brands. Revenue breakdown by geography in 2024 shows Indonesia contributing 62.50% (US$314.30 million) and Regional Markets 37.50% (US$188.40 million). In 2023, Indonesia contributed 65.60% (US$353.10 million) and Regional Markets 34.40% (US$185.10 million). The decline in Indonesia's Net Sales in 2024 was 11.00% (7.50% on a constant currency basis), while Regional Markets saw a 1.80% increase (2.90% on a constant currency basis). The decrease in Agency Brands in Indonesia was mainly due to the termination of an agency brand in 2023. |
| Operating Efficiency | In 2024, EBITDA decreased by 19.00% to US$60.30 million from US$74.50 million in 2023. The EBITDA Margin also declined to 12.00% in 2024 from 13.80% in 2023, a decrease of 1.80 percentage points. This decline was attributed to lower Net Sales, the impact of a stronger US Dollar on imported raw material costs, a reduced gross margin, and higher operating costs. On a constant currency basis, the EBITDA decrease would have been 15.40%. Selling and distribution costs in 2024 were US$63.96 million, a slight increase of 0.85% from US$63.42 million in 2023. Administrative expenses also increased by 1.58% to US$26.95 million in 2024 from US$26.53 million in 2023. In 2023, EBITDA was US$74.50 million, a 0.70% increase from US$74.00 million in 2022. The EBITDA Margin in 2023 was 13.80%, a decrease of 1.70 percentage points from 15.50% in 2022. This was due to higher selling and distribution costs and increased advertising and promotion expenses to combat competition and strengthen core brands. Selling and distribution costs in 2023 increased by 13.00% year-over-year, while administrative expenses decreased by 4.49% to US$26.53 million from US$27.77 million in 2022. The increase in selling and distribution costs in 2023 was primarily driven by wage inflation and higher distribution costs. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate for the Group was 30.87% in 2024 (calculated as Income Tax Expense of US$15.16 million divided by Profit Before Income Tax of US$49.11 million), an increase from 29.26% in 2023 (calculated as Income Tax Expense of US$19.13 million divided by Profit Before Income Tax of US$65.39 million). This represents a 1.61 percentage point increase in the effective tax rate. The increase in the effective tax rate in 2024 was influenced by a lower profit before tax, which amplified the impact of non-deductible expenses and withholding taxes relative to the overall profit. In 2023, the effective tax rate was 29.26%, a decrease from 30.37% in 2022 (calculated as Income Tax Expense of US$19.15 million divided by Profit Before Income Tax of US$63.04 million). The decrease in 2023 was primarily due to a higher profit before tax, which diluted the impact of certain non-deductible expenses and withholding taxes. There were no non-recurring items reported in either 2024 or 2023 that significantly affected profitability. The 2021 report mentioned non-recurring gains of US$4.10 million related to employee retirement obligations and asset disposals, but these were not present in the 2023 or 2024 periods. |

| Operational efficiency | Operating expenses (Selling and Distribution Costs + Administrative Expenses) increased slightly by 0.99% to US$90.91 million in 2024 from US$90.00 million in 2023. The operating margin (EBITDA / Revenue) decreased to 12.00% in 2024 from 13.80% in 2023.

The operating margin (EBITDA / Revenue) decreased to 13.80% in 2023 from 15.50% in 2022. This indicates a slight decline in operational efficiency, primarily due to increased promotional spending and higher distribution costs. Asset turnover was 1.28 in 2023, an increase from 1.21 in 2022, indicating improved asset utilization. |
| Financial risk identification and early warning | The Group's total debt decreased by 24.20% to US$24.78 million in 2024 from US$32.74 million in 2023. The net cash position improved to US$19.00 million in 2024 from US$26.60 million in 2023, indicating a stronger financial position. The interest coverage ratio (EBITDA / Finance Costs) was 42.49 in 2024, a decrease from 61.22 in 2023, but still very healthy. The company faces currency risk due to weaker regional currencies against the US Dollar, impacting raw material costs and sales.

| Future financial performance projection | The outlook for 2025 remains challenging due to geopolitical tensions, trade wars, currency volatility, and high cocoa prices. However, the company has started 2025 with positive sales momentum, driven by strong brands like SilverQueen and investments in growth. Proactive measures such as price adjustments, operational efficiency improvements, and cost optimization are being implemented to mitigate high input costs. The strong balance sheet and cash flow generation provide resilience. The company aims to deepen customer engagement and embrace innovation to navigate uncertainties. | The outlook for 2024 was uncertain due to global macroeconomic challenges, high commodity prices (especially cocoa), and increased competition.

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## S4.1: Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | The company faces significant market risks from a challenging economic environment, heightened geopolitical tensions, and record-high cocoa prices. Weaker regional currencies against the US Dollar, particularly the Indonesian Rupiah, impact raw material costs. Increased promotional investments are necessary to counter strong competition and drive long-term brand growth. The termination of an agency brand in late 2023 also contributed to a decline in Net Sales. These factors collectively damage the company's revenue, gross profit, and overall profitability. | The company faces market risks from global geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties, high inflationary environments, significant increases in global commodity prices (especially cocoa), and volatility in regional currencies. A more competitive landscape in Indonesia and potential decreases in consumer sentiment due to foreign exchange volatility could weigh on consumer spending. These factors pressure growth and margins, impacting profitability. |
| Operational Risks | Operational risks include the impact of a stronger US Dollar on imported raw material costs, leading to reduced gross margins. Higher operating costs and increased promotional investments to maintain market share also pose operational challenges. Supply chain constraints due to extreme weather, crop disease, and production disruptions in key cocoa markets create volatility in cocoa prices, affecting input costs and potentially impacting consumer behavior due to higher retail chocolate prices. | Operational risks include higher ingredient prices (especially record-high cocoa prices), supply chain issues, and commodity price volatility. The need to increase promotional spending to fend off competition and strengthen core brands impacts gross profit margins. The company also faces challenges in managing working capital requirements due to strong sales growth and increased trade receivables. |
| Financial Risks | Financial risks are evident in the 6.6% year-on-year decline in Net Sales and a 26.6% year-on-year decrease in PATMI, primarily due to weaker regional currencies against the US Dollar and higher promotional spending. Gross Profit decreased by 10.1% year-on-year, and EBITDA decreased by 19.0% year-on-year, reflecting lower Net Sales, increased raw material costs, and higher operating expenses. The depreciation of the Indonesian Rupiah by 3.9% against the US Dollar negatively impacted raw material costs and reduced the Gross Profit Margin by 1.1 percentage points. | Financial risks include the impact of higher ingredient prices, particularly record-high cocoa prices, which pressure gross profit margins. Increased promotional spending to counter competition and strengthen brands also depresses short-term profitability. Foreign exchange volatility in the region could further impact financial performance. The company's effective tax rate was 29.3%, which is a significant portion of its profit. |
| Compliance Risks | The company faces compliance risks related to climate-related disclosures, with new IFRS S1 and S2 reporting requirements announced for listed companies in Singapore. Failure to comply with these evolving regulations could lead to reputational damage and potential penalties. The company also needs to ensure compliance with international food safety standards and certifications, which are regularly audited by external professional bodies. | The company faces compliance risks related to evolving climate change concerns and the need for increased transparency and accountability for indirect GHG emissions (Scope 3). While the company is working to quantify and disclose these emissions, the early stages of this process mean specific commitments or targets are difficult to identify, potentially exposing the company to future regulatory scrutiny or stakeholder pressure. The company also adheres to local and international food safety standards and ethical business practices. |
