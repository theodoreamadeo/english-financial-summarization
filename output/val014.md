## S4.1: Risk Factors

### 4.1.1. Market Risks

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---------- | :---------- | :---------- |
| Competition | The property industry in Indonesia is characterized by increasing competition due to a growing number of developers and new property projects. This intensified competition makes it more challenging for the Company to capture market share, requiring continuous innovation and added value in its offerings. | The property industry in Indonesia is experiencing increasingly fierce competition due to a growing number of developers and new property projects. This intensified competition makes it more challenging for the Company to capture market share, requiring continuous innovation and added value in its offerings. |
| Market Demand | The residential property market in Indonesia experienced a slowdown in Q4 2024, with the Residential Property Price Index (IHPR) growing at a lower rate (1.39% YoY) compared to the previous quarter. Sales contracted by 15.09% YoY, particularly for small house types. This indicates a significant slowdown in demand, influenced by rising mortgage interest rates and consumer caution due to economic uncertainties. | The Indonesian property market in 2023 showed positive growth, but residential property sales in the primary market contracted by 6.59% YoY in Q3 2023, despite an improvement from the previous quarter's 12.30% contraction. This was primarily due to high lending rates and delayed purchasing decisions. |
| Economic Conditions | Indonesia's economic growth in 2024 showed resilience (5.03% YoY) amidst global turmoil, driven by household consumption and investment. However, global economic slowdown (projected 3.2% in 2024 by IMF) and geopolitical conflicts could impact export performance and foreign direct investment, potentially affecting domestic purchasing power and increasing poverty. | Indonesia's economic growth in 2023 showed resilience despite global challenges, with growth estimated between 4.5% and 5.3%. This was driven by household consumption and infrastructure investment. However, global economic slowdown, high inflation, and rising interest rates posed challenges. |
| Political Factors | Global political uncertainty and geopolitical conflicts (e.g., Russia-Ukraine, Middle East tensions) are creating economic instability, disrupting supply chains, and increasing energy and food prices. These factors could reduce global economic growth and indirectly affect Indonesia's export performance and domestic purchasing power. | Global economic slowdown, geopolitical conflicts, and tightening monetary policies in developed countries contributed to high inflation and rising energy/food prices. These factors could lead to decreased purchasing power and increased poverty at the national level. |
| Interest Rate Fluctuations | The increase in the BI benchmark interest rate to 6.25% in April 2024 directly impacted borrowing costs, including KPR, potentially reducing consumer purchasing power. Although the rate was lowered to 6% in September 2024, high interest rates remain a challenge for property developers. | The BI benchmark interest rate increased twice by 25 basis points each, reaching 6% in October 2023. This rise directly impacted mortgage costs, potentially reducing consumer purchasing power and affecting property demand. |
| Land Availability | The scarcity of land, especially in urban areas, remains a classic challenge for the property industry. While the Company has significant land reserves (4,410 hectares), limited availability drives developers to seek alternatives like vertical projects or utilizing previously unconsidered land. | N/A |
