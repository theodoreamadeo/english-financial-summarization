# Section 3: Business Analysis

## 3.1 Profitability Analysis

| Perspective | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | Net sales increased by 3.50% from $12,984,399 thousand in 2023 to $13,442,849 thousand in 2024. This growth was primarily driven by a 5.20% increase in comparable sales on a 52-week to 52-week basis, or $641,800 thousand, partially offset by the absence of the 53rd week in 2023, which contributed $170,200 thousand to net sales in the prior year. The remaining decrease in net sales was attributed to Moosejaw and other store closures, partially offset by new store openings, including DICK'S House of Sport and Golf Galaxy Performance Center locations. The comparable sales increase included a 4.00% rise in sales per transaction and a 1.20% increase in transactions, reflecting growth in footwear, athletic apparel, accessories, and hydration, offset by declines in outdoor-related categories (hunt, apparel, and equipment) and fitness. Gross margin improved by 98 basis points, from 34.92% in 2023 to 35.90% in 2024. This improvement was due to a 64 basis point increase in merchandise margins, resulting from a favorable sales mix, quality assortment, a 25 basis point decrease in inventory shrink (compared to a cumulative unfavorable impact in 2023), and a $12,000 thousand inventory write-down in 2023 related to Business Optimization. Occupancy costs remained flat as a percentage of net sales, despite a $38,700 thousand increase, due to higher net sales. Lower eCommerce shipping and fulfillment costs also contributed to the gross profit improvement. |
| Operating Efficiency | Operating income increased from $1,282,365 thousand in 2023 to $1,473,932 thousand in 2024, representing a 14.94% growth. The operating margin improved by 108 basis points, from 9.88% in 2023 to 10.96% in 2024. Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased from $3,183,530 thousand in 2023 to $3,294,272 thousand in 2024, but remained approximately flat as a percentage of net sales. This $110,742 thousand increase in SG&A was due to strategic investments in technology and marketing, along with higher incentive compensation, partially offset by $72,800 thousand in Business Optimization charges incurred in 2023. Pre-opening expenses decreased from $67,840 thousand in 2023 to $57,492 thousand in 2024, reflecting fluctuations based on the timing and number of new store openings and relocations. The current year included pre-opening expenses for seven DICK'S House of Sport stores, compared to nine in the prior year. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate increased from 20.60% in 2023 to 23.30% in 2024. This increase was primarily due to a $36,800 thousand higher excess tax benefit in 2023, resulting from a greater number of employee equity awards vesting and being exercised at a higher share price in the prior year. In 2023, the company incurred pre-tax charges of $84,800 thousand from its Business Optimization, including $46,100 thousand of non-cash impairments of store and intangible assets, $26,700 thousand of severance-related costs, and a $12,000 thousand write-down of inventory. The $12,000 thousand inventory write-down was reflected in cost of goods sold, while the remaining $72,800 thousand of severance-related costs and non-cash impairments were reflected in selling, general, and administrative expenses. In 2024, there were no comparable one-off charges of this magnitude. |

### 4.1.1. Market Risks

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | The company faces market risks from macroeconomic conditions such as inflation, elevated interest rates, and geopolitical conflicts, which can adversely affect consumer discretionary spending, leading to decreased athlete traffic, comparable sales, and average transaction value.
