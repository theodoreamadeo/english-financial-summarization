Employee benefit expenses increased from $905.50 million in 2023 to $969.30 million in 2024. Depreciation and amortisation increased from $175.00 million in 2023 to $192.00 million in 2024.

| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate for underlying profit was 29.20% in 2023 ($127.30 million tax on $436.10 million underlying profit before tax) and 29.80% in 2024 ($120.50 million tax on $403.70 million underlying profit before tax).

# Section 4: Risk Factors

## 4.1 Risk Factors

| Perspective | 2024 Report | 2023 Report |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Market Risks | Metcash faces market risks from changing consumer behavior and preferences due to economic conditions, digital disruption, healthy living trends, sustainability preferences, and increasing retail choices. Failure to adapt strategies to these changes, such as the strong shift to value-conscious choices and declining tobacco sales, could materially impact financial performance and profitability. The Hardware pillar is particularly sensitive to cyclicality in building and construction markets, which are currently experiencing a slowdown due to higher interest rates and lower consumer confidence. | Metcash faces market risks from evolving consumer behavior influenced by economic conditions, digital disruption, healthy living trends, and sustainability preferences. Changes in these factors, particularly the decline in tobacco sales and shifts in consumer spending habits, could adversely affect sales mix and earnings. The Hardware pillar is susceptible to cyclicality in building and construction markets, impacting demand and profitability. |
| Operational Risks | Operational risks include potential project execution issues, delays, scope variations, or cost overruns in transformation programs like Project Horizon. Disruptions to the supply chain, product sourcing, or key support systems could impact operational capability and financial performance. Reliance on third-party outsourcing for finance and IT functions (e.g., Tata Consulting Services) introduces risks of service disruption. Compliance with Metcash's processes by joint venture stores and minority partners is less direct, posing a risk to operational performance. | Operational risks include potential project execution issues, delays, or cost overruns in strategic initiatives like the MFuture program and Project Horizon. Supply chain disruptions, such as those experienced during floods and rail disruptions in FY22, can impact efficiency and ability to meet customer requirements. The reliance on a low-cost distribution model means efficiency is critical, and any disruption can increase costs. |
| Financial Risks | Financial risks include increased credit risk due to competitive trading conditions and adverse economic conditions, affecting independent retailers. Funding and liquidity risks are present due to the need to fund operations and growth initiatives. High inflation and interest rates increase the cost of debt and pose refinancing risks. Failure to meet debt covenants could lead to repayment demands. The Ritchies put option, if exercised, could divert significant funds, impacting capital investments and potentially requiring additional funding. | Financial risks include increased credit risk for independent retailers due to competitive trading conditions and adverse economic conditions. Higher interest rates and increased debt levels contribute to higher finance costs. The put option liabilities, particularly for Total Tools and Ritchies, represent significant financial obligations that could impact liquidity and capital allocation if exercised. The increase in working capital from strategic inventory investment and Hardware growth also affects cash flow. |
| Compliance Risks | Compliance risks involve adherence to various regulatory requirements, including work health and safety, food and product safety, environmental, industrial relations, privacy, and industry codes. Breaches could lead to fines, penalties, investigations, liabilities, and reputational damage. New laws and regulations, or increases in levies (e.g., in Victoria), could materially impact operational and financial performance through increased compliance costs. Modern slavery risks in the supply chain also pose reputational and operational threats. | Compliance risks include adherence to various regulatory requirements such as work health and safety, food and product safety, environmental regulations, and industry codes. Non-compliance could result in fines, penalties, investigations, and reputational damage. The introduction of new laws or increases in levies could impact operational and financial performance. Metcash's designation as a 'critical food and grocery asset' under the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018 (Cth) requires implementation of specific compliance measures. |

| Economic challenges such as inflation, recession risks, and shifting consumer behavior that could impact revenue and profitability. | Current economic conditions remain challenging and continue to impact consumer confidence with a strong shift in consumer behavior to more value-conscious choices, which is expected to continue into the FY25 financial year. The company's platform of three diversified businesses is fundamentally strong, and it has plans, teams, and capabilities to deliver future growth through the current economic cycle. The company works closely with suppliers and retailers to maintain value offerings and competitive prices. | While demand continues to be solid in all pillars, the impact of higher interest rates and cost of living has started to impact consumer confidence and the behavior of some customers and shoppers in the retail networks. The business is actively managing increased cost pressures, particularly labor, as well as an increased tax burden in Victoria due to recently announced changes in workers' compensation, payroll, and land tax, with an estimated increase of ~10.0 million in FY24. |
| Competitive pressures from both established industry players and new, disruptive market entrants that the company faces | Any increase in competitive activity from new or existing competitors (including acquisitions of independent stores, soliciting customers to non-Metcash banners, price wars, or new market entrants with wholesale models) may have a detrimental effect on the Group's operations, particularly if the response is ineffective or delayed. Increased competition may also adversely impact Metcash's long-term performance and profitability. The company manages this risk through its strategic plan and execution of initiatives. | Any increase in competitive activity from new or existing competitors (including acquisitions of independent stores, new market entrants, or suppliers selling directly to customers) may have a detrimental effect on the Group's operations, particularly if Metcash fails to respond effectively or its response is delayed.
