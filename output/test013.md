# Section 3: Business Analysis

## S3.1: Profitability Analysis

| Perspective | Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| Revenue & Direct-Cost Dynamics | In 2024, the company's revenue increased by 36.63% to RM545,698,000 from RM399,392,000 in 2023. This growth was primarily driven by higher progressive recognition from ongoing development projects and new launches. The gross profit margin improved to 35.77% in 2024 from 43.48% in 2023. This decrease in gross margin indicates that while revenue increased, the cost of sales grew at a faster rate (55.29% increase in cost of sales from RM225,724,000 in 2023 to RM350,484,000 in 2024). Residential properties accounted for 93.00% of sales and commercial properties for 7.00% in 2024, compared to 67.00% residential and 33.00% commercial in 2023. All revenue was generated from Malaysia. |
| Operating Efficiency | The company's operating efficiency, as measured by operating income before non-recurring items, showed a positive trend. Profit before tax increased by 6.82% from RM368,398,000 in 2023 to RM393,507,000 in 2024. Administrative and general expenses decreased slightly by 2.31% from RM192,414,000 in 2023 to RM187,962,000 in 2024, indicating some level of cost control. However, other expenses increased by 20.35% from RM76,124,000 in 2023 to RM91,618,000 in 2024. The overall operating margin (Profit Before Tax / Revenue) was 72.12% in 2024, a decrease from 92.24% in 2023, suggesting that while revenue grew, the increase in cost of sales and other expenses outpaced revenue growth, impacting overall operating efficiency. |
| External & One-Off Impact | The effective tax rate for the company increased from 22.26% in 2023 to 25.10% in 2024. This increase resulted in a higher tax expense of RM98,767,000 in 2024 compared to RM81,992,000 in 2023. Non-recurring items significantly impacted profitability. In 2024, the company recorded a fair value gain on investment properties of RM44,235,000, a reversal of impairment losses on financial assets of RM668,000, and a reversal of impairment losses on non-financial assets of RM1,525,000. In 2023, these figures were RM39,359,000, RM5,389,000, and RM21,629,000 respectively. The fair value gain on investment properties increased by 12.39% in 2024, while the reversal of impairment losses on financial assets decreased significantly by 87.60%, and the reversal of impairment losses on non-financial assets decreased by 92.96%.

The dividend policy of 30.00% to 50.00% of realised PATAMI indicates a commitment to shareholder returns. | The company anticipates continued challenges from soft market sentiments, economic uncertainties, and geopolitical conflicts.
